also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and the right shoulder ; for it is a ram of consecration :

and I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be THY gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak , and say , For mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ? turn from THY fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against THY people .

of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising , a scab , or a bright spot , and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy ; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest , or unto one of his sons the priests :
and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh : and when the hair in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy : and the priest shall look on him , and pronounce him unclean .
if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
and the priest shall look on him the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more :
and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
and if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin , and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot , wheresoever the priest looketh ;
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hair in the bright spot , and it be no lower than the other skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and if the priest look on the plague of the scall , and , behold , it be not in sight deeper than the skin , and that there is no black hair in it ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days :

and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of leprosy , and shall be shewed unto the priest :
and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day : if the plague be spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in a skin , or in any work that is made of skin ; the plague is a fretting leprosy ; it is unclean .
and if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof :
and if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a spreading plague : thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire .
and the garment , either warp , or woof , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean .
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
and he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and wash himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the trespass offering : it is most holy :
and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord :
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass offering :
and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
and he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering , and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot :
and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering :
and the rest of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
then the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house :
and if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after that he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plaistered ;
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
and if the priest shall come in , and look upon it , and , behold , the plague hath not spread in the house , after the house was plaistered : then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
and he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times :
he shall put on the holy linen coat , and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh , and shall be girded with a linen girdle , and with the linen Mitre shall he be attired : these are holy garments ; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water , and so put them on .
but the goat , on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an Atonement with him , and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness .
and he shall take of the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times .
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the vail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat :
and he shall make an Atonement for the holy place , because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel , and because of their transgressions in all their sins : and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the Congregation , that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness .
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the Congregation when he goeth in to make an Atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an Atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the Congregation of Israel .
and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord , and make an Atonement for it ; and shall take of the blood of the bullock , and of the blood of the goat , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about .
and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place , and put on his garments , and come forth , and offer his burnt offering , and the burnt offering of the people , and make an Atonement for himself , and for the people .
and the bullock for the sin offering , and the goat for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make Atonement in the holy place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall burn in the fire their skins , and their flesh , and their Dung .
and this shall be a statute for ever unto you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall afflict your souls , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger that sojourneth among you :
and the priest , whom he shall anoint , and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest 's office in his father 's stead , shall make the Atonement , and shall put on the linen clothes , even the holy garments :
and he shall make an Atonement for the holy sanctuary , and he shall make an Atonement for the tabernacle of the Congregation , and for the altar , and he shall make an Atonement for the priests , and for all the people of the Congregation .
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the Lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord .
and whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
and whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
after the doings of the land of Egypt , wherein ye dwelt , shall ye not do : and after the doings of the land of Canaan , whither I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordinances .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done : and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him .
and when ye shall come into the land , and shall have planted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised : three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you : it shall not be eaten of .
but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
again , thou shalt say to the children of Israel , Whosoever he be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel , that giveth any of his seed unto Molech ; he shall surely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall uncover her nakedness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean , and between unclean fowls and clean : and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast , or by fowl , or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground , which I have separated from you as unclean .
say unto them , Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from my presence : I am the Lord .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest :
and ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year , and one young bullock , and two rams : they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord , with their meat offering , and their drink offerings , even an offering made by fire , of sweet savour unto the Lord .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of THY field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of THY harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the Lord your God .
seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord : on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord : it is a solemn assembly ; and ye shall do no servile work therein .
also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days : on the first day shall be a sabbath , and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath .
and the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
and the Israelitish woman 's son blasphemed the name of the Lord , and Cursed . and they brought him unto Moses : ( and his mother 's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan : )
and he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord , he shall surely be put to death , and all the Congregation shall certainly stone him : as well the stranger , as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
and if a man purchase of the Levites , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land : and they shall be your possession .
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession ; they shall be your bondmen for ever : but over your brethren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and I will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my Covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
the land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sabbaths , while she lieth desolate without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity : because , even because they despised my judgments , and because their soul abhorred my statutes .
and if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then THY estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female THY estimation shall be three shekels of silver .
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tabernacle of the Congregation , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and the children of Reuben , Israel 's eldest son , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , by their polls , every male from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
of the children of Simeon , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , those that were numbered of them , according to the number of the names , by their polls , every male from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;

of the children of Naphtali , throughout their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
and when the tabernacle setteth forward , the Levites shall take it down : and when the tabernacle is to be pitched , the Levites shall set it up : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies : and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah .
these are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers : all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
those that were numbered of them , according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred .
and the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the Congregation shall be the tabernacle , and the tent , the covering thereof , and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation ,
and the hangings of the court , and the curtain for the door of the court , which is by the tabernacle , and by the altar round about , and the cords of it for all the service thereof .
and of Kohath was the family of the Amramites , and the family of the Izeharites , and the family of the Hebronites , and the family of the Uzzielites : these are the families of the Kohathites .
and under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and the sockets thereof , and all the vessels thereof , and all that serveth thereto ,
and all the firstborn males by the number of names , from a month old and upward , of those that were numbered of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen .
and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , wherewith they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , wherewith they minister about it , even the censers , the fleshhooks , and the shovels , and the basons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers ' skins , and put to the staves of it .
from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tabernacle of the Congregation .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them , every one that entereth into the service , to do the work of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the Congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof ,
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
these were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites , all that might do service in the tabernacle of the Congregation , which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
these are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon , of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the Congregation , whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the Lord .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
and a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
and the priest shall set the woman before the Lord , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , The Lord make thee a curse and an oath among THY people , when the Lord doth make THY thigh to rot , and THY belly to swell ;
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
and the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
and it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle , and had anointed it , and sanctified it , and all the instruments thereof , both the altar and all the vessels thereof , and had anointed them , and sanctified them ;
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the Shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
and the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for the Levites .
in the fourteenth day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the rites of it , and according to all the ceremonies thereof , shall ye keep it .
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and forbeareth to keep the passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what Goodness the Lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee .
and when the people complained , it displeased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the Congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
and the Lord came down in a cloud , and spake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
and there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day 's journey on this side , and as it were a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , unto the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the Congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the Lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the Congregation , that all the Congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignorance :
and the priest shall make an Atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an Atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring :
so they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
and it came to pass , when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the Congregation : and , behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
speak unto the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers , of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods : write thou every man 's name upon his rod .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the Lord spake unto Aaron , behold , I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel ; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to THY sons , by an ordinance for ever .
this shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for THY sons .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord , them have I given thee .
thus speak unto the Levites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the Lord 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and upon which never came yoke :
Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the Congregation , because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord : the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him ; he is unclean .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
and the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and , behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
and the sons of Eliab ; Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . this is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the Lord :
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the Congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
and he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation .
and their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock , and the third part of an hin unto a ram , and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips , wherewith she bound her soul , of none effect : and the Lord shall forgive her .
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them ; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband hath made them void ; and the Lord shall forgive her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establisheth all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confirmeth them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
and they slew the kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slain ; namely , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the Congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
and levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the Levites , which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that , behold , the place was a place for cattle ;
for when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
and the Lord 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed .
and Moses gave unto them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , with the cities thereof in the coasts , even the cities of the country round about .
and they departed from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians .
and Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes , and thorns in your sides , and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh @-@ barnea , and shall go on to Hazar @-@ addar , and pass on to Azmon :
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers , have received their inheritance ; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance :
and the Congregation shall deliver the Slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was anointed with the holy oil .
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spake before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel :
and when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
and every daughter , that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers .
and it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them ;
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
and command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
this day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
from Aroer , which is by the brink of the river of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the Lord our God delivered all unto us :
only take heed to thyself , and keep THY soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen , and lest they depart from THY heart all the days of THY life : but teach them THY sons , and THY sons ' sons ;
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a Graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the Lord THY God hath forbidden thee .
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord THY God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the Lord THY God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain did burn with fire , ) that ye came near unto me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and ye said , behold , the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God doth talk with man , and he liveth .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the Lord said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
that thou mightest fear the Lord THY God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and THY son , and THY son 's son , all the days of THY life ; and that THY days may be prolonged .
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto THY children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
( for the Lord THY God is a Jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord THY God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
but because the Lord loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the Lord THY God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the Lord .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant which the Lord made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gave them unto me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
and what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day ;
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst THY seed , and wateredst it with THY foot , as a garden of herbs :
and then the Lord 's wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord THY God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord :
Thou mayest not eat within THY gates the tithe of THY corn , or of THY wine , or of THY oil , or the firstlings of THY herds or of THY flock , nor any of THY vows which thou vowest , nor THY freewill offerings , or heave offering of thine hand :
if the place which the Lord THY God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of THY herd and of THY flock , which the Lord hath given thee , as I have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in THY gates whatsoever THY soul lusteth after .
and thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the Lord THY God : and the blood of THY sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord THY God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord THY God : for every abomination to the Lord , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the Lord your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
if there be among you a poor man of one of THY brethren within any of THY gates in THY land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from THY poor brother :
Thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the Lord THY God shall bless thee in all THY works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all THY coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which the Lord THY God shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt .
and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the Lord THY God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the Lord THY God , according as the Lord THY God hath blessed thee :
and thou shalt rejoice in THY feast , thou , and THY son , and THY daughter , and THY manservant , and THY maidservant , and the Levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are within THY gates .
seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord THY God in the place which the Lord shall choose : because the Lord THY God shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the works of thine hands , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that wicked thing , unto THY gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones , till they die .
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within THY gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the Lord THY God shall choose ;
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord THY God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the Lord THY God shall choose : one from among THY brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not THY brother .
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his children , in the midst of Israel .
and this shall be the priest 's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord THY God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord THY God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
but the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the Lord THY God hath given thee .
and it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
and it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .
then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
in like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment ; and with all lost thing of THY brother 's , which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
that which is gone out of THY lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord THY God , which thou hast promised with THY mouth .
when thou comest into the standing corn of THY neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto THY neighbour 's standing corn .
when a man hath taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hath found some uncleanness in her : then let him write her a bill of divorcement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the Lord : and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance .
when a man hath taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken .
at his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and setteth his heart upon it : lest he cry against thee unto the Lord , and it be sin unto thee .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
forty stripes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then THY brother should seem vile unto thee .
that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring of THY land that the Lord THY God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose to place his name there .
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the Lord THY God , that I am come unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for to give us .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaister them with plaister .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the Lord THY God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
the Lord shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with an inflammation , and with an extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blasting , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before THY face , and shall not be restored to thee : THY sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
the Lord shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of THY foot unto the top of THY head .
and he shall besiege thee in all THY gates , until THY high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all THY land : and he shall besiege thee in all THY gates throughout all THY land , which the Lord THY God hath given thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of THY sons and of THY daughters , which the Lord THY God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all THY gates .
and it shall come to pass , that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
in the morning thou shalt say , Would God it were even ! and at even thou shalt say , Would God it were morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a God , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto THY fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses which the Lord hath laid upon it ;
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the Lord THY God hath driven thee ,
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other gods , and serve them , and provoke me , and break my Covenant .
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities : and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
this book of the law shall not depart out of THY mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make THY way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by : and thou shalt bring THY father , and THY mother , and THY brethren , and all THY father 's household , home unto thee .
and Joshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
and as they that bare the Ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the Ark were dipped in the brim of the water , ( for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the Ark of the Lord passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
and it came to pass , when the priests that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up unto the dry land , that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place , and flowed over all his banks , as they did before .
for the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
and it came to pass , when Joshua had spoken unto the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns passed on before the Lord , and blew with the trumpets : and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them .
and the city shall be accursed , even it , and all that are therein , to the Lord : only Rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
and the young men that were spies went in , and brought Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing : for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took of the accursed thing : and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel .
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have commanded you .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the north side of AI : now there was a valley between them and AI .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smote them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned unto AI , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before Gibeon , and made war against it .
and it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
and that day Joshua took Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho .
and the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
and they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and all the souls that were therein .
and it came to pass , when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , and to the king of Achshaph ,
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Joshua take , and smote them with the edge of the sword , and he utterly destroyed them , as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded .
and all the spoil of these cities , and the cattle , the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves ; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to breathe .
for it was of the Lord to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the Lord commanded Moses .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon , and all the plain on the east :
and their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
and now , behold , the Lord hath kept me alive , as he said , these forty and five years , even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses , while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness : and now , lo , I am this day fourscore and five years old .
as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
and it went out to the south side to Maaleh @-@ acrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh @-@ barnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and fetched a compass to Karkaa :
from thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En @-@ shemesh , and the goings out thereof were at En @-@ rogel :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
there was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of Joseph ; to wit , for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families ; for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families .
and the coast descended unto the river Kanah , southward of the river : these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh : the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and the outgoings of it were at the sea :
and Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth @-@ shean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth @-@ aven .
and the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Ataroth @-@ adar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth @-@ horon .
and the border was drawn thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before Beth @-@ horon southward ; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath @-@ baal , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and turneth toward the sunrising to Beth @-@ dagon , and reacheth to Zebulun , and to the valley of Jiphthah @-@ el toward the north side of Beth @-@ Emek , and Neiel , and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand ,
and the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites : and the children of Aaron the priest , which were of the Levites , had by lot out of the tribe of Judah , and out of the tribe of Simeon , and out of the tribe of Benjamin , thirteen cities .
and the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
and the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
and they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
and unto the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Beesh @-@ terah with her suburbs ; two cities .
now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
and when they came unto the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan , a great altar to see to .
and the children of Israel heard say , behold , the chidren of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
and the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and they came unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord , What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have builded you an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , unto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
and I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and the children of the Kenite , Moses ' father in law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which lieth in the south of Arad ; and they went and dwelt among the people .
neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shean and her towns , nor Taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns : but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth @-@ anath ; but he dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shemesh and of Beth @-@ anath became tributaries unto them .
and an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers ; and I said , I will never break my Covenant with you .
and it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the Lord to anger .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
and they tarried till they were ashamed : and , behold , he opened not the doors of the parlour ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
and , behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael came out to meet him , and said unto him , Come , and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest . and when he came into her tent , behold , Sisera lay dead , and the nail was in his temples .
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
and so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the Lord had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast down , and the grove was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the Fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pitched beside the well of Harod : so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
and it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and the interpretation thereof , that he worshipped , and returned into the host of Israel , and said , arise ; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian .
and the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the Lord set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @-@ shittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abel @-@ meholah , unto Tabbath .
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ; )
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , thou shalt rise early , and set upon the city : and , behold , when he and the people that is with him come out against thee , then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smote them .
and Abimelech , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and gat them up to the top of the tower .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim , and Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Zidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines , and forsook the Lord , and served not him .
while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns , and in Aroer and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon , three hundred years ? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time ?
then it shall be , that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , shall surely be the Lord 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand : wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
for it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar . and Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks , and also the standing corn , with the vineyards and olives .
and it came to pass , when their hearts were merry , that they said , Call for Samson , that he may make us sport . and they called for Samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel .
and they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and the children of Dan set up the Graven image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel 's father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel 's father had said unto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
and when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
and they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and when he was come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , together with her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the coasts of Israel .
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Belial , which are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . but the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel :
and the children of Israel arose , and went up to the house of God , and asked counsel of God , and said , Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? and the Lord said , Judah shall go up first .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
and the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smote them with the edge of the sword , as well the men of every city , as the beast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
and they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
then she arose with her daughters in law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
turn again , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . if I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh : and the child was young .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smote the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emerods in their secret parts .
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth @-@ shemesh , and went along the highway , lowing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth @-@ shemesh .
and the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord , and the coffer that was with it , wherein the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth @-@ shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he had a son , whose name was Saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he : from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not THY mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all THY father 's house ?
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
and when they forgat the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
now it came to pass upon a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
and between the passages , by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines ' garrison , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and dipped it in an honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
so Saul took the kingdom over Israel , and fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and whithersoever he turned himself , he vexed them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishui , and Melchi @-@ shua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Saul came to Carmel , and , behold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to Gilgal .
David said moreover , The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the Lord be with thee .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in a shepherd 's bag which he had , even in a scrip ; and his sling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Philistine .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was much set by .
and when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel .
and every one that was in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was discontented , gathered themselves unto him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
Saul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : wherefore he came down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of Maon . and when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .
and Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ gedi .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord , and evil hath not been found in thee all THY days .
yet a man is risen to pursue thee , and to seek THY soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord THY God ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee , and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel ;
that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offence of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causeless , or that my lord hath avenged himself : but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid .
and Abigail came to Nabal ; and , behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken : wherefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
and David arose , and came to the place where Saul had pitched : and David beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his host : and Saul lay in the trench , and the people pitched round about him .
and it came to pass in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . and Achish said unto David , Know thou assuredly , that thou shalt go out with me to battle , thou and THY men .
and the woman said unto him , behold , thou knowest what Saul hath done , how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ?
and the Lord hath done to him , as he spake by me : for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and given it to THY neighbour , even to David :
and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins : and when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him : for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @-@ Shan , and came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
it came even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent , and earth upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and did obeisance .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead , and said unto them , blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gibeon : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
and let it be , when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself : for then shall the Lord go out before thee , to smite the host of the Philistines .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine . so all the people departed every one to his house .
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of THY sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and when THY days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with THY fathers , I will set up THY seed after thee , which shall proceed out of THY bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
and he smote Moab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Moabites became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
then said Ziba unto the king , According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant , so shall THY servant do . as for Mephibosheth , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the Syrians of Zoba , and of Rehob , and Ish @-@ tob , and Maacah , were by themselves in the field .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city . so Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass in an eveningtide , that David arose from off his bed , and walked upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and I gave thee THY master 's house , and THY master 's wives into THY bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take THY wives before thine eyes , and give them unto THY neighbour , and he shall lie with THY wives in the sight of this sun .
so Amnon lay down , and made himself sick : and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said unto the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
so Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . and she took flour , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and did bake the cakes .
and I , whither shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept : and the king also and all his servants wept very sore .
now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and THY handmaid said , I will now speak unto the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid .
and Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Joab said , To day THY servant knoweth that I have found grace in THY sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year 's end that he polled it : because the hair was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king 's weight .
and lo Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him , bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God : and they set down the Ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
and hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
and when king David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and Cursed still as he came .
for , said Hushai , thou knowest THY father and his men , that they be mighty men , and they be chafed in their minds , as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field : and THY father is a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that THY father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
and when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose , and gat him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
and Joab came into the house to the king , and said , Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all THY servants , which this day have saved THY life , and the lives of THY sons and of THY daughters , and the lives of THY wives , and the lives of THY concubines ;
and there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bare unto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite :
and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
these be the names of the mighty men whom David had : the Tachmonite that sat in the seat , chief among the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite : he lift up his spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the Lord .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of Kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of Moab : he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .
notwithstanding the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the host . and Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
Wherefore his servants said unto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in THY bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
and thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the Brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : THY blood shall be upon thine own head .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath . and they told Shimei , saying , behold , THY servants be in Gath .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
the son of Geber , in Ramoth @-@ gilead ; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him also pertained the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars :
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Zif , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
concerning this house which thou art in building , if thou wilt walk in my statutes , and execute my judgments , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with thee , which I spake unto David THY father :
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the cieling : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir .
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and he set the cherubims within the inner house : and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and he called the name thereof Boaz .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ;
and the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto king Solomon in Jerusalem , that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and they brought up the Ark of the Lord , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims .
and the Lord hath performed his word that he spake , and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
who hast kept with THY servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which THY servant prayeth before thee to day :
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge THY servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of THY servants , and of THY people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon THY land , which thou hast given to THY people for an inheritance .
then hear thou in heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ; )
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives , saying , We have sinned , and have done perversely , we have committed wickedness ;
and so return unto thee with all their heart , and with all their soul , in the land of their enemies , which led them away captive , and pray unto thee toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , the city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name :
and forgive THY people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them :
and it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord , he arose from before the altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
blessed be the Lord , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
and let these my words , wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord , be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night , that he maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hallowed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
and a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon , Forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to THY servant .
and they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran : and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
and it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ; )
and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loins .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again , that they sent and called him unto the Congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord , even unto Rehoboam king of Judah , and they shall kill me , and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah .
now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to thee , eat no bread , and drink no water ; THY carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of THY fathers .
and it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
and Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . but Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he slew all the house of Baasha : he left him not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of his kinsfolks , nor of his friends .
and it came to pass , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshipped him .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
and it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entering in of the cave . and , behold , there came a voice unto him , and said , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and it shall come to pass , that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of THY servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @-@ hadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Ivory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he walked in all the ways of ASA his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin :
but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say unto them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inquire of Baal @-@ zebub the god of Ekron ?
then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty . and he went up to him : and , behold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he spake unto him , Thou man of God , the king hath said , Come down .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , behold , there appeared a chariot of fire , and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
and he went up from thence unto Bethel : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mocked him , and said unto him , Go up , thou bald head ; go up , thou bald head .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
for thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
so they poured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out , and said , O thou man of God , there is death in the pot . and they could not eat thereof .
and it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent THY clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
and it came to pass , when they were come into Samaria , that Elisha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
and it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clothes ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and , behold , he had sackcloth within upon his flesh .
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
and he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab : for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab .
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab THY master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel .
and Jehu sent through all Israel : and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and ye shall compass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that cometh within the ranges , let him be slain : and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in .
and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that should go out on the sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
but Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said unto them , Have her forth without the ranges : and him that followeth her kill with the sword . for the priest had said , Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king 's house : and there was she slain .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Baal , and brake it down ; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . and the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
and he took the rulers over hundreds , and the captains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . and he sat on the throne of the kings .
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the oversight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders , that wrought upon the house of the Lord ,
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , as they were burying a man , that , behold , they spied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha : and when the man was let down , and touched the bones of Elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
and Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered Damascus , and Hamath , which belonged to Judah , for Israel , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am THY servant and THY son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
and he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the Lord , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Ava , and from Hamath , and from Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel : and they possessed Samaria , and dwelt in the cities thereof .
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab @-@ shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem . and they went up and came to Jerusalem . and when they were come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the fuller 's field .
now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised Reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it : so is Pharoah king of Egypt unto all that trust on him .
now therefore , I pray thee , give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria , and I will deliver thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
because THY rage against me and THY tumult is come up into mine ears , therefore I will put my hook in THY nose , and my bridle in THY lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and it came to pass that night , that the angel of the Lord went out , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and Esar @-@ haddon his son reigned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a conduit , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the Lord .
so Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asahiah , went unto Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ; ) and they communed with her .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
behold therefore , I will gather thee unto THY fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into THY grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
and he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord , without Jerusalem , unto the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and stamped it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people .
and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down , and brake them down from thence , and cast the dust of them into the Brook Kidron .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
and like unto him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own sepulchre . and the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
and the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord , as the Lord had said .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ adan , captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , unto Jerusalem :
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , did the Chaldees break in pieces , and carried the brass of them to Babylon .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , ruler .
and when all the captains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethahiah , and Johanan the son of Careah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah .
the sons of Shelah the son of Judah were , ER the father of Lecah , and Laadah the father of Mareshah , and the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen , of the house of Ashbea ,
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Seir , having for their captains Pelatiah , and Neariah , and Rephaiah , and Uzziel , the sons of Ishi .
these are the children of Abihail the son of Huri , the son of Jaroah , the son of Gilead , the son of Michael , the son of Jeshishai , the son of Jahdo , the son of Buz ;
the sons of Reuben , and the Gadites , and half the tribe of Manasseh , of valiant men , men able to bear buckler and sword , and to shoot with bow , and skilful in war , were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore , that went out to the war .
and these were the heads of the house of their fathers , even Epher , and Ishi , and Eliel , and Azriel , and Jeremiah , and Hodaviah , and Jahdiel , mighty men of valour , famous men , and heads of the house of their fathers .

and the sons of Bela ; Ezbon , and Uzzi , and Uzziel , and Jerimoth , and IRI , five ; heads of the house of their fathers , mighty men of valour ; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four .
and by the borders of the children of Manasseh , Beth @-@ shean and her towns , Taanach and her towns , Megiddo and her towns , Dor and her towns . in these dwelt the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of Asher , heads of their father 's house , choice and mighty men of valour , chief of the princes . and the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .

and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of ASA , the son of Elkanah , that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites .
they arose , all the valiant men , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord THY God said unto thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
and the three brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the Lord ,
now these are they that came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
and it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines .
and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites that bare the Ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ephod of linen .
and it shall come to pass , when THY days be expired that thou must go to be with THY fathers , that I will raise up THY seed after thee , which shall be of THY sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God ; for thou hast also spoken of THY servant 's house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
them also king David dedicated unto the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will help thee .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set upon David 's head : and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city .
and Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword .
now , behold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance : timber also and stone have I prepared ; and thou mayest add thereto .
these were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers ; even the chief of the fathers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and upward .
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the work of the service of the house of God ;
and there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers , and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers .
moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen according to their service was :
which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
and all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated ; and whosoever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shelomith , and of his brethren .
among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief , even among the Hebronites , according to the generations of his fathers . in the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the chambers round about , of the treasuries of the house of God , and of the treasuries of the dedicated things :
also for the courses of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every candlestick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the candlesticks of silver by weight , both for the candlestick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every candlestick .
moreover , because I have set my affection to the house of my God , I have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house ,
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers . and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord ?
Thine , O Lord , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O Lord , and thou art exalted as head above all .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep THY commandments , THY testimonies , and THY statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Samuel the seer , and in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the book of Gad the seer ,
so Solomon , and all the Congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the Congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
and they fetched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
and the porch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the height was an hundred and twenty : and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
and he reared up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
to wit , the two pillars , and the pommels , and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars ;
and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished : and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims :
and they drew out the staves of the Ark , that the ends of the staves were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is unto this day .
the Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken : for I am risen up in the room of David my father , and am set on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
Thou which hast kept with THY servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge THY servants , by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head ; and by justifying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of THY servants , and of THY people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon THY land , which thou hast given unto THY people for an inheritance .
then hear thou from heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of THY people Israel , but is come from a far country for THY great name 's sake , and THY mighty hand , and THY stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , whither they have carried them captives , and pray toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , and toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for THY name :
moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
if my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
Howbeit I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of THY wisdom was not told me : for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loins .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
and ASA and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar : and the Ethiopians were overthrown , that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
and at that time Hanani the seer came to ASA king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the Lord THY God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
and ASA in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physicians .
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes , even to Ben @-@ hail , and to Obadiah , and to Zechariah , and to Nethaneel , and to Michaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
for it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the Congregation ;
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
and they came up into Judah , and brake into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , save Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
and he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . and Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel , because he was sick .
and it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them .
and in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into Covenant with him .
and they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
but let none come into the house of the Lord , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
and the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he cometh in , and when he goeth out .
so the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go out on the sabbath : for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
and he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
and the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
now it came to pass , after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense unto them .
and Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth @-@ shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria : but he helped him not .
and Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
then the Levites arose , Mahath the son of Amasai , and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the Kohathites : and of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi , and Azariah the son of Jehalelel : and of the Gershonites ; Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah :
and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . and the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad into the Brook Kidron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord : so they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days ; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
so they killed the bullocks , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : likewise , when they had killed the rams , they sprinkled the blood upon the altar : they killed also the lambs , and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar .
now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the Lord , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
and all the Congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the Congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
and concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord their God , and laid them by heaps .
after this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem , ( but he himself laid siege against Lachish , and all his power with him , ) unto Hezekiah king of Judah , and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem , saying ,
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his Goodness , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom : also he observed times , and used enchantments , and used witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with wizards : he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
and he took away the strange gods , and the idol out of the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer unto his God , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and to the hand of the workmen .
and Hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college : ) and they spake to her to that effect .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
and Josiah gave to the people , of the flock , lambs and kids , all for the passover offerings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullocks : these were of the king 's substance .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the Lord , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the oxen .
his servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had ; and they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers . and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes ; all these he brought to Babylon .
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel , ( he is the God , ) which is in Jerusalem .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon , and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah , every one unto his city ;
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
and of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name :
then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to set forward the workmen in the house of God : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brethren the Levites .
but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people : for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard afar off .
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over , and set in the cities of Samaria , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be builded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings .
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered unto one , whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , unto Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
and whosoever will not do the law of THY God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
blessed be the Lord God of our fathers , which hath put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem :
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
and weighed unto them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his counsellers , and his lords , and all Israel there present , had offered :
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
and Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
but if ye turn unto me , and keep my commandments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven , yet will I gather them from thence , and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
and it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine , and gave it unto the king . now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence .
and I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem : neither was there any beast with me , save the beast that I rode upon .
and the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they builded the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it , unto the tower of Hananeel .
but the Dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Beth @-@ haccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
after him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of the half part of Beth @-@ zur , unto the place over against the sepulchres of David , and to the pool that was made , and unto the house of the mighty .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and the Arabians , and the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites , heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth ,
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the habergeons ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
they which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Judah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the captivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah , every one unto his city ;
the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , an hundred thirty and eight .
and of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
so the priests , and the Levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the Nethinims , and all Israel , dwelt in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their cities .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
and all the Congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths , and sat under the booths : for since the days of Jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so . and there was very great gladness .
and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharoah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them . so didst thou get thee a name , as it is this day .
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them .
yet thou in THY manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness : the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew them light , and the way wherein they should go .
for they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in THY great Goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .

from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the Lord hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the candle .
to wit , Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ;
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
and the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be Dung upon the ground .
thus saith the Lord ; Stand in the court of the Lord 's house , and speak unto all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in the Lord 's house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
now it came to pass , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Thou shalt surely die .
when the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house unto the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the Ammonites , and to the king of Tyrus , and to the king of Zidon , by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah ;
and it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet , which was of Gibeon , spake unto me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
know that thus saith the Lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David , and of all the people that dwelleth in this city , and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity ;
the Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
all THY lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not ; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because THY sins were increased .
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured ; and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey .
and out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
and it shall come to pass , that like as I have watched over them , to pluck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to afflict ; so will I watch over them , to build , and to plant , saith the Lord .
not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my Covenant they brake , although I was an husband unto them , saith the Lord :
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
in the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the vale , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them , saith the Lord .
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion , and all the people , fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew , which hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee : but your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
but ye turned and polluted my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection , to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth .
and Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
but it came to pass , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spake unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah : and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
therefore go thou , and read in the roll , which thou hast written from my mouth , the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fasting day : and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house , in the ears of all the people .
then he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's chamber : and , lo , all the princes sat there , even Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , unto Baruch , saying , Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come . so Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand , and came unto them .
so the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elishama the scribe 's chamber . and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
therefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me ; behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
thus saith the Lord , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Jeremiah sunk in the mire .
now when Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuchs which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
so they shall bring out all THY wives and THY children to the Chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
but if the princes hear that I have talked with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death ; also what the king said unto thee :
and it came to pass , that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , by the gate betwixt the two walls : and he went out the way of the plain .
but the Chaldeans ' army pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after that Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed unto him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans , which will come unto us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men that were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and slew him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
and it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it unto you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
if ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up : for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them .
for ye dissembled in your hearts , when ye sent me unto the Lord your God , saying , pray for us unto the Lord our God ; and according unto all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it .
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
and it came to pass , that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they have committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods , and all the women that stood by , a great multitude , even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
so that the Lord could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without an inhabitant , as at this day .
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
the word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
he made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the Lord .
but fear not thou , O my servant Jacob , and be not dismayed , O Israel : for , behold , I will save thee from afar off , and THY seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon it , even upon Moab , the year of their visitation , saith the Lord .
they that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and shall devour the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
therefore hear the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there , and the owls shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation .
therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them .
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shields : the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the Lord , the vengeance of his temple .
when he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens ; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth : he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers .
and I will punish Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him : yea , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
therefore , behold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Graven images of Babylon : and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
and it shall be , when thou hast made an end of reading this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of Euphrates :
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
then Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people , and the residue of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
and the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , and come up upon my neck : he hath made my strength to fall , the Lord hath delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
the Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me : he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men : the Lord hath trodden the virgin , the daughter of Judah , as in a winepress .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
the Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and hath not pitied : he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah ; he hath brought them down to the ground : he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof .
the Lord hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary , he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a solemn feast .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon their heads ; they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
the Lord hath done that which he had devised ; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old : he hath thrown down , and hath not pitied : and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee , he hath set up the Horn of thine adversaries .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up THY hands toward him for the life of THY young children , that faint for hunger in the top of every street .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom , that was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I looked , and , behold , a whirlwind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the colour of Amber , out of the midst of the fire .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , and like the appearance of lamps : it went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I saw as the colour of Amber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his loins even upward , and from the appearance of his loins even downward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had brightness round about .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make THY tongue cleave to the roof of THY mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
but when I speak with thee , I will open THY mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ;
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
Wherefore , as I live , saith the Lord God ; surely , because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all THY detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also diminish thee ; neither shall mine eye spare , neither will I have any pity .
and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys ; behold , I , even I , will bring a sword upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense THY ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense thee according to THY ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of Amber .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
and he brought me into the inner court of the Lord 's house , and , behold , at the door of the temple of the Lord , between the porch and the altar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temple of the Lord , and their faces toward the east ; and they worshipped the sun toward the east .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer 's inkhorn by his side ;
and the Lord said unto him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord 's glory .
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
and the cherubims lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight : when they went out , the wheels also were beside them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the Lord ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
in their sight shalt thou bear it upon THY shoulders , and carry it forth in the twilight : thou shalt cover THY face , that thou see not the ground : for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel .
and I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for captivity , and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the twilight , and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
so will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .

and as for THY nativity , in the day thou wast born THY navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of THY person , in the day that thou wast born .
thus wast thou decked with gold and silver ; and THY raiment was of fine linen , and silk , and broidered work ; thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil : and thou wast exceeding beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
Thou hast also taken THY fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down THY high places : they shall strip thee also of THY clothes , and shall take THY fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
and they shall burn thine houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women : and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
Thou art THY mother 's daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of THY sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
and thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at THY left hand : and THY younger sister , that dwelleth at THY right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
when I shall bring again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring again the captivity of THY captives in the midst of them :
when THY sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and THY daughters shall return to your former estate .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand unto them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known unto them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
and I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out .
and I will purge out from among you the rebels , and them that transgress against me : I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord God ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
for in mine holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , saith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the firstfruits of your oblations , with all your holy things .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the Slayer .

thus will I make THY lewdness to cease from thee , and THY whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .

when they took hold of thee by THY hand , thou didst break , and rend all their shoulder : and when they leaned upon thee , thou brakest , and madest all their loins to be at a stand .

and when I shall put thee out , I will cover the heaven , and make the stars thereof dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
son of man , speak to the children of THY people , and say unto them , When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their coasts , and set him for their watchman :
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely because my flock became a prey , and my flock became meat to every beast of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flock ;

and at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
and he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cubits , with the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;

and they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them , whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
and the first of all the firstfruits of all things , and every oblation of all , of every sort of your oblations , shall be the priest 's : ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .

and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar , and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court .

and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
and the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand westward : and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion ; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city .
