it must be borne inmind that the Commission 's objective in the merger control field is to preserve asituation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be aguarantee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
the Community dimension of a merger or acquisition isassessed using thresholds based on the turnover of the companies involved.The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EUR 5 000 million ) and the Community @-@ wide threshold ( EUR 250 million ) .

as will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evaluations are often very closely interrelated ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
this chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evaluators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it relies ; the frequency of external evaluation .
either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
in Wales , the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspections by 2008 , after which a different cycle will be introduced . United Kingdom ( SCT ) : ( 1 ) relates to evaluation of all higher education institutions ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education .
chapter 3 -Internal Evaluation of initial Teacher Education
however , there is no explicit mention of this having to happen - simply an expectation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
Alternatively , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evaluations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . in Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
the following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the availability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
Germany : only the results of external evaluations to ( re- ) accredit bachelor 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 Länder ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illustrated in the examples below .
Belgium ( BE Fr ) : the information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
these two projects are currently being implemented .
in these two countries , regulations on both accreditation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
Belgium ( BE Fr ) : the information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
Italy : ( 1 ) refers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education , and ( 2 ) to teacher unions or associations and private @-@ sector training providers .
responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e.g. an audit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspectorate specifically established for school education or inservice teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
in line with the decentralised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accreditation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Autonomous Community to the next .
as regards evaluation and accreditation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many Länder have established or appointed central institutes or agencies for this task .
Finland : Inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider .
in Hungary , the process occurs at three levels . at preparatory level , the organiser of the programme asks an expert from the National Register of Experts to give an opinion on it .
in a second stage , an expert from the Pedagógus @-@ továbbképzési Akkreditációs Testület ( In @-@ service Teacher Training Accrediting Body ) evaluates the programme in accordance with a guideline based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme .
in the French Community of Belgium , the Institut de la formation en cours de carriere , a community @-@ wide institution , organises and evaluates inservice teacher education , notably through its operators .
the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accreditation of inservice teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
furthermore , the SuliNova Kht ( a non @-@ profit organisation ) monitors inservice teacher education programmes by means of a selfevaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervises and approves the National Centre of Inservice Training activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
the results of the accreditation and evaluation of inservice education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( Chapter 4 ) .
in the Netherlands , accreditation results are published on the website of the Nederlands @-@ Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie ( NVAO , or Accreditation Organisation of The Netherlands and Flanders ) .
the introduction of the two @-@ cycle ( bachelor / master ) structure in several Länder in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and compulsory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the definition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .

the reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stakeholders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its format , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports questionnaires ( ARQ ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
in countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @-@ production ) " ( 3 ) .

the 2007 ESPAD report substance use among students in 35 countries
country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more evenly distributed pattern , with spirits as the most important type , constituting about one third of the total consumption .
there were gender differences in the frequencies of drunkenness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ESPAD level there were no gender differences .
the most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the proportion of students reporting heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i.e. by 31 percentage points .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
countries in which many students report drunkenness this often include Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days drunkenness .
lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
in the two top @-@ prevalence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man ) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found , and the percentage of high @-@ risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illicit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ESPAD countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of cannabis between 2003 and 2007 .
the overall substance @-@ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus .
the upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lifetime use of illicit drugs - predominantly cannabis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising .
• the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , the WHO Regional Office for Europe , Interpol , the World Customs Organisation , the Swedish Council for Information on Alcohol and other Drugs ( CAN ) , and the Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS ;
nearly 25 % of opioid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ageing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being causally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @-@ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all highprevalence countries .
the emergence of mCPP illustrates the fact that those involved in the production of illicit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chemicals that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA ( ecstasy ) .
there are similarities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @-@ 04 action plan , conducted externally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and internally by the Institute for Drugs and Addiction ( IDT ) .
first , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 in June 2005 .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the steering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the EMCDDA and Europol , as well as representatives of the Member States .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise definition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
directive 91 / 308 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modified in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among Member States .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guideline on cannabis , " according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
see " The role of the quantity in the prosecution of drug offences , " an ELDD legal report , and Table 1 in " illicit drug use in the EU : legislative approaches , " an
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used cannabis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by stealing ( Kivivuori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment , effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
in most EU Member States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
over the same five @-@ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @-@ based prevention ( e.g. in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA @-@ driven development and implementation of indicator @-@ based monitoring , standardised reporting on responses is limited .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( Figure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see Chapter 6 ) .
32 receiving such treatment stabilised or decreased (
the reduction of drugrelated deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
in the new central European Member States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @-@ injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
an initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
the 2005 @-@ 08 action plan calls on Member States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes . "
although social measures are still a less well @-@ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interventions combining treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug user rehabilitation .
the service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to " generic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the cannabis resin seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Senegal , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; INCB , 2006a ) .
( 50 ) Taking 1999 as the base year for the value of money in all countries . ( 51 ) See Figure PPP @-@ 2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 52 ) See Table PPP @-@ 5 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 53 ) The average proportion was computed as the average of national prevalence rates weighted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs , with the standard time frames , and frequency of use .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 40.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lifetime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @-@ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lifetime prevalence ranges from 32 % to 40 % .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @-@ onset users ( pre- to mid @-@ adolescence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( Von Sydow et al . , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ) .
brief interventions are cost @-@ effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interventions may take the form of counselling , " cannabis courses " or even self @-@ help websites .
for example , the German website @-@ based counselling programme , Quit the Shit ( www.drugcom.de ) , is an innovative approach , using telematics , for cannabis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .
data on both number of amphetamine seizures and quantities of amphetamine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on quantities of amphetamine seized were not available for Slovenia in 2004 ; data on number of amphetamine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .
total number of tablets analysed in 2004 .
95 number of ecstasy seizures (
demands for treatment related to ecstasy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ecstasy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .
the shortage of prevalence data on GHB and ketamine suggests that use of these substances has stabilised at low levels in most countries .
however , the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area .
the decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances so that measures applicable in the Member States for the control of narcotic and psychotropic substances ( 2 ) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances if appropriate .
assessment and control of new psychoactive substances was published in the Official Journal of the European Union ( OJ L 127 , 20.5.2005 , pp. 32 @-@ 37 ) and took effect on 21 May 2005 .
most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America ( mainly Colombia ) or via Central America and the Caribbean . in 2004 , Suriname , Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , Ecuador , Curaçao , Jamaica , Mexico , Guyana and Panama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; CND , 2006 ; INCB , 2006a ; Europol , 2006 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe better identified by focusing the analysis on groups in which drug use is concentrated , in particular young people living in urban areas .
among clients reporting primary use of opioids , 31 % in Italy , 42 % in the Netherlands and 44 % in the United Kingdom report a secondary cocaine use . among primary cocaine users , 28 % in Italy and 38 % in the United Kingdom report secondary use of opioids .
overall , most cocaine treatment demands in Europe are not related to crack cocaine : around 80 % of new outpatient cocaine clients are reported to be using cocaine hydrochloride ( cocaine powder ) , with less than 20 % using
as cocaine use can escalate quickly , brief interventions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth exploring .
for example , one study of an innovative outreach treatment programme in Rotterdam ( Henskens , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for treating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
Netherlands ( 167 ) . the average purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most reporting countries ( 168 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
) See Table PPP @-@ 6 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ) In the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , data on heroin purity were available for at least three consecutive years : for brown heroin in the Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain ,
for example , in countries with a high proportion of stimulant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of injecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
in some EU @-@ 15 Member States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
countries where a sizeable proportion of opioid clients are using substances other than heroin include Hungary , where the use of home @-@ made opium poppy products is widespread , and Finland , where most opioid clients are misusing
excluding the Czech Republic and France , where high @-@ dose buprenorphine treatment ( HDBT ) is reported to be the most common option , more than 90 % of treatments in all other countries were with methadone .
in France , where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003 , there has been an increase in the incidence of HIV among IDUs ( albeit from a low level ) , from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in
41 % of a sample of 964 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and exceptionally high in another ( Kohtla @-@ Järve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
since the mid1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see Chapter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of epidemic spread of HIV among injectors .
in 2003 @-@ 04 , prevalence rates of over 60 % among IDU samples were reported from Italy and Poland , while samples with prevalence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium , Ireland , Cyprus , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
in the Nordic region , the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs , and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries .
in Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .
the purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
it was estimated that in six of the locations ( Amsterdam , Barcelona , Dublin , London , Rome and Vienna ) 10 @-@ 23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15 @-@ 49 years could be attributed to opioid use , mainly overdoses , AIDS and external causes ( accidents , suicides ) .
in this section , and in the EMCDDA protocol , the term " drugrelated deaths " refers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and , generally , occurring shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
this trend is common in EU @-@ 15 Member States and has been observed since the early 1990s , although in Sweden and the United Kingdom it is less marked .
the EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 203 ) .
national trends in drugrelated deaths can provide some insight into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin epidemics and high @-@ risk behaviours ( e.g. injection ) , as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin availability .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .
although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe methadone substitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce overdose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work , which , for a range of methodological and practical reasons , is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence , stigmatised and largely hidden .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
these sorts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the composite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can encompass the target concept .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging Member States to develop and expand harm @-@ reduction activities .
drug use among those who are developing both physically and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompanying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
the EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Worryingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @-@ 6 % in 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ) .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems arising from lack of security .
reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly .
of drug treatment data and drug overdoses suggests that the heroin @-@ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
there is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess Coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
the conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
a first observation is that such instruments can be useful for a longitudinal follow @-@ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be contextualised with the analysis of individual indicators within the indexes .
this figure is likely to underestimate the full extent of drug @-@ related public expenditure , given the high level of under @-@ reporting . the six countries included in Table 1 account for 76 % of the total public expenditure reported by EU Member States
in addition , as of 2005 , the EC and the Member States had co @-@ financed drug @-@ related assistance projects in third countries to the value of over EUR 750 million .
in response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 , the EMCDDA is currently working towards developing a methodology that will enable the Member States , candidate countries and Norway to compile standardised data on drug @-@ related expenditure .
proportion of overall expenditure devoted to as a proportion health and social law as a proportion of total public amount ( EUR million )
at the end of 2006 , the European Commission presented its first progress review ( 5 ) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) .
this assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan 's objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled .
the drug programme is still being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council , in view of its adoption under the co @-@ decision procedure .
in Ireland , substantive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 , which sets out new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour and proposals to strengthen imposition of the 10 @-@ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EUR 13 000 or more .
this is stated to be in the interest of good order , safety , health and security , and would be carried out on samples of urine , oral fluids and / or hair .
in Romania , a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use , as well as measures to improve judicial cooperation , surveillance and cross @-@ border pursuit and transfer of legal procedures .
the Netherlands , Turkey and Norway , drug law offences related to dealing and trafficking are predominant , with these offences accounting for up to 92 % ( the Czech Republic ) of all drug law offences reported in 2005 .
in the Czech Republic , methamphetamine @-@ related offences predominated , accounting for 53 % of all drug law offences , while in Luxembourg cocaine was the most reported substance ( implicated in 35 % of drug law offences ) .
the term " reports " for drug law offences is given in quotation marks because it describes different concepts in different countries ( police reports of suspected drug law offenders , charges for drug law offences , etc . ) .
taking peer @-@ reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries .
EU funding for drug @-@ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @-@ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .

although selective prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in peer @-@ to @-@ peer programmes ( Cho et al . , 2005 ; Dishion and Dodge , 2005 ) , because negative " Contagion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
residential services are , however , of growing importance in the care of elderly and long @-@ term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the coexistence of serious somatic and psychological co @-@ morbidity .
the philosophy of inpatient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
further details are available at http : / / eldd.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 5036See Table HSR @-@ 6 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
in some countries ( e.g. Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , structured reintegration programmes are provided only as a follow @-@ on from successfully completed abstinence @-@ based drug dependence treatment , and specific reintegration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
one important element in this picture is the different cannabis products now available on the European market . historically , three main forms of cannabis have been common in Europe : cannabis resin ; herbal cannabis ; and , far less frequently , cannabis oil .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using cannabis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in cannabis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
developing psychometric scales to identify intensive , dependent and problematic cannabis use in survey data there are important temporal differences between countries and waves of popularity observable in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 1960s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Reitox national report ) where a relatively high level of experimentation was reported in the 1970s among conscripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 1970s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
levels of cannabis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .
however , there are interesting variations between countries , with cannabis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . for the remaining countries , in 12 the proportion of
there are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
in Denmark , smash is an anonymous support and counselling project for young cannabis users , intended to reduce the harmful effects , provide information and support to help them stop smoking cannabis ( 52
data on seizures and quantities seized of amphetamine , ecstasy and LSD are not available for all countries for 2005 ; see the seizure tables in the 2007 statistical bulletin for more information . )
in recent school surveys , increases in lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a progressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversifying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
estimates of cocaine use for shorter reference periods ( 98 ) suggest that in the last year , of the 3.5 million ( 2.4 % ) young adults who have used the drug , 1.5 million ( 1 % ) have used it in the last month .
the reported increase in last year cocaine prevalence in Spain since 2001 can be attributed to increased levels of use in the 15 @-@ 24 age group , rather than across 15 @-@ 34 year olds as a whole .
although small in number , crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .
detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 118 ) .
estimates of problematic cocaine use are scarce and the PDU indicator is , except in few high @-@ prevalence countries , likely to be less reliable for this drug . ) See Figure PDU @-@ 4 ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( TDI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requesting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 123 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
in the EU Member States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug substitution treatments was at least 585 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service availability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
the absolute decrease of new opioids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the proportion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .
figure 10 : number of opioid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem opioid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be homeless .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20 ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon ( 133 ) .
there are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to BZP . in March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of BZP by
mCPP their legislation addressing psychotropic substances .
in Amsterdam , the reported number of non @-@ fatal emergencies due to the use of GHB was 76 in 2005 , exceeding , as in previous years , the medical emergencies attributed to use of
in interpreting this data , a number of considerations should be borne in mind : infected IDUs may not be diagnosed if they are not in contact with health services ; new infections may not necessarily be attributed to drug injection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analysing levels of HIV infection in samples of new IDUs ( those injecting less than two years ) and young IDUs ( those under age 25 ) .
most available time series for the EU show stable prevalence , suggesting that the numbers of infected IDUs dying are balanced by the numbers of IDUs contracting HIV infection .
among young IDUs ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high prevalence ( over 40 % in at least one sample ) was found in seven countries and among new IDUs , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United
in the case of hepatitis B , the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases appears generally to have declined , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes . no general trend is visible for the proportion of IDUs among notified cases of hepatitis
" drug @-@ induced deaths " and " acute drug deaths " ( 155 ) .
in Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
the Czech Republic , Denmark , Germany , Latvia , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal and the United Kingdom .
figure 13 : overall trend in acute drug @-@ related deaths , 1996 @-@ 2005 for all Member States with available data account for a decreasing proportion of overdoses ( 170 ) .
a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are polydrug use by opioid users , or a possible increase in the availability of heroin .
increases in the proportion of drug @-@ related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia , Luxembourg and Austria , and to a lesser extent in Latvia and
a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
research suggests that concurrent use of other drugs , particularly alcohol and sedative drugs , may increase the risk of fatal opioid overdose and , therefore , polydrug use is an important issue for services to address .
EMCDDA ( 2005 ) , Annual report 2005 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe , European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , Lisbon .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date , and what directions should be pursued in the future .
this distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
drug use prevention : evidence base grows but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving reintegration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high prognostic value .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users .
the portal , which includes a prevention module , provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions .
last month use : around 2 million
local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conceal and do not necessitate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more recreational basis .
however , patterns of stimulant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most commonly used stimulant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
in 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will renew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will renew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will renew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking offence .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all widen the scope for directing drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
in the five @-@ year period 2001 @-@ 06 , the number of drug law offences involving cannabis increased or remained stable in most reporting countries , resulting in an overall average increase of 34 % in the European Union ( Figure 2 ) .
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the EMCDDA through its network of Reitox national focal points .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe lack of qualified research staff ( Latvia , Hungary ) ; and methodological aspects ( data protection issues , problems in reaching hidden populations , lack of continuity in research projects ) .
in addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction , articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer @-@ reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines .
several research studies have shown that interventions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environments and reduce social exclusion , also have a moderating effect on later substance use ( Toumbourou et al . , 2007 ) .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only ineffective but may carry risks of unwanted effects ( Werch and Owen , 2002 ) .
around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes ( NSPs ) , which target overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases .
in Hungary , where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing , a study among the out @-@ of @-@ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
financial support for harmreduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among injecting drug users and in prison settings . "
after methadone , buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute , and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years ( see Chapter 6 ) .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
however , there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment .
( Reitox national reports ) . herbal cannabis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Nigeria , Angola ) , south @-@ east Asia ( Thailand ) , south @-@ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americas ( Colombia , Jamaica ) ( CND , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity : with twice as many seizures ( 325 000 ) and the amount intercepted ( 713 tonnes ) eight times higher .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @-@ 03 , the number of cannabis resin seizures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities intercepted increased until 2003 @-@ 04 , but thereafter have been declining .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 , SZR @-@ 4 , SZR @-@ 5 and SZR @-@ 6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
in 2006 , the reported THC content of resin samples ranged from 2.3 % to 18.4 % , while that of herbal cannabis ranged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once ( lifetime prevalence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15- to 64 @-@ year- olds ( see Table 2 for a summary of the data ) .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) have ever used cannabis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
group have used cannabis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
in some countries it is virtually unreported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among males .
after tobacco and alcohol , cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students .
estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
although among cannabis users the last month prevalence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and binge drinking among cannabis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
a comparison of HBSC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreasing trend in both lifetime and other more frequent cannabis use among 15 @-@ year @-@ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
client profiles in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . those variations may be explained by differences in prevalence of intensive cannabis use , drug treatment organisation or referral practices .
overall , primary cannabis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequency of use : those who use it occasionally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
in addition , Belgium , Germany , France , the Netherlands and Switzerland are collaborating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family @-@ based treatment for problematic cannabis use ( Incant ) ( 58 ) .
project Prism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs , through a system of preexport notifications for licit trade and the reporting of shipments stopped and seizures made when suspicious transactions occur .
seizures of safrole , which may replace 3,4 @-@ MDP @-@ 2 @-@ P in the synthesis of MDMA , remained marginal in 2006 , with 62 litres seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seizure of safrole ( 7 litres ) .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 11 to SZR @-@ 18 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Stimulant markets in Europe : the relative prevalence of cocaine or amphetamines in seizures and population surveys , and the proportion of drug users in treatment reporting these substances as primary drugs
last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.7 % and 1.9 % .
for example , recreational and less intensive and damaging patterns of use among socially wellintegrated users can coexist with intensive use among more marginalised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risky modes of administration , such as injection and smoking .
only one Member State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amphetamine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 12000 and 22000 problem amphetamine users ( 4.3 to 7.9 casesper1000 , aged 15 @-@ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem opioid users in the country .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) , lifetime prevalence estimates area little higher ( 0.3 % to 7.1 % ) , although lower prevalence levels are reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
stable thereafter . a marked increase in amphetamine use is reported in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 , but the results of the 2005 survey indicate a decrease in the use of this substance since the beginning of this decade ( 73
countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15 @-@ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
analysis of the number of laboratories dismantled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before exportation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .
West Africa : now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005 , accounting for 28 % of the European total in 2006 , points to the growing use of the Iberian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market .
the data on European cocaine seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 9 and SZR @-@ 10 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe reporting very low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.4 @-@ 1.2 % ) .
UnitedKingdom ( 87 ) .
national estimates of problem cocaine use ( injection or long duration / regular use ) are available only for Spain and Italy , and regional estimates are available for the United Kingdom .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
ever in lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students is 2 % or lower in most countries , rising to 4 % in Spain and 5 % in the UnitedKingdom ( 89
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the USA .
the second is a more marginalised group of clients who are typically smoking or injecting cocaine ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either crack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several Member States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adapting their traditionally opioid @-@ oriented services to the varied cocaine and crack @-@ using populations .
Modafinil , a central nervous system stimulant , has shown particularly promising results as a psychostimulant substitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential substitute drugs ( e.g. d @-@ amphetamine ) , its abuse liability is low ( Myrick et al . , 2004 ) .
in Italy , a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals ( aripiprazole and ropinirole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . in this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
the amount of heroin intercepted in an average seizure varied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seizure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( Figure 6 ) .
however , large seizures of morphine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2007a ) .
global seizures of acetic anhydride ( used in the illicit manufacture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 litres in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 litres ) and Colombia ( 8 800 litres ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 litres ) ( INCB , 2008b ) .
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
the EMCDDA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for incidence estimation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( Scalia Tomba et al . , 2008 ) .
most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other opioids ( 23 % ) and cannabis ( 18 % ) .
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
figure 8 : estimates of the prevalence of injecting drug use ( casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ) an increase in the proportion of polydrug users among heroin clients and arise in the number of clients using opioids other than heroin .
the varying levels of new injectors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
prescription of medical heroin ( diamorphine ) , as a treatment option for chronic treatment @-@ resistant opioid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 815 clients in 2006 ) , the UnitedKingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive diamorphine according to a special regulation .
additionally , a randomised trial of injectable opioids ( RIOTT ) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine , injectable methadone and oral methadone .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence .
by the end of 2006 , the incidence of diagnosed HIV infection among injecting drug users ( IDUs ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
data on newly diagnosed cases related to injecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @-@ 02 , which was due to outbreaks in Estonia , countries , HIV prevalence remained unchanged during the period .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
the EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths ( 136 ) refers to those deaths that are directly caused ( poisonings or overdoses ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substances present is an illicit
moreover , many druginduced deaths are , in fact , polydrug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
the second component is broader and covers deaths which cannot be directly attributable to the pharmacological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @-@ term consequences of infectious diseases , interactions with mental health issues ( e.g. suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e.g. road traffic accidents ) .
however , other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community ( see " Overall drugrelated mortality , " P . 86 ) .
most of these deaths are attributable to the misuse of methadone diverted from hospitals , pharmacies , practitioners and pain management physicians , while only a limited number of them are attributed to methadone obtained from substitution programmes ( 146 ) .
a recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extrapolated from cohort studies to local ( Bargagli et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( Cruts et al . , 2008 ) .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e.g. consequences of other infectious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and estimation in this area ( see preceding section ) .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the EMCDDA conducted a snapshot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
the USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
the use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dissuasion of drug abuse . "
commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @-@ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young males . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
a caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @-@ dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe .
in Europe today , polydrug patterns are the norm , and the combined use of different substances is responsible for , or complicates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute , which may be even more damaging .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreases , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs .
Worryingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations .
the illicit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adapt quickly to control measures .
again , market factors and precursor chemicals appear important here , with methamphetamine production sites appearing now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilitates the import of precursors , in this case 1 @-@ phenyl @-@ 2 @-@ propanone ( BMK ) , from outside of the European Union .
changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals , and these efforts may also have important
this year , the EMCDDA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harmreduction interventions , the web @-@ based approaches have considerable potential .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
new substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans .
forensic analysis , however , has largely failed to detect the plant @-@ based substances declared on the labels , but did identify in some samples synthetic cannabinoids that had been added to the mixtures .
the enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identifies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Coordination , cooperation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international cooperation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which reviews current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN Member States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
a key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Drugs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 2008a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of finalising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @-@ 08 programme with a 1 @-@ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UNGASS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narcotic Drugs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU Member States .
most countries could provide data on central government expenditure , and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
in contrast , for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new offence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EUR 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece

the United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @-@ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evaluating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combines training in life @-@ skills with normative education and knowledge acquisition on substances .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bullying , past @-@ week and past @-@ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drinks on one occasion and having tried cannabis .
selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
similarly , the " Komet för föräldrar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing externalising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive peer relations .
in Turkey , substitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . in 16 countries , specialised public outpatient services are the main providers of substitution treatment .
the mean age of drug users entering inpatient treatment is 30 years , but opioid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 28 ) and cannabis ( 26 ) .
the ratio is lower among primary users of non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.1 : 1 ) and cannabis ( 8 : 1 ) .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
the new module also includes : links to other information sources , evaluated interventions , a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , infectious diseases testing and counselling , vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis .
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their tenancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consensual crime , " where consenting individuals secretly participate in an unlawful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e.g. during a foot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a Scottish study , which found that recovering drug users who received employment @-@ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( McIntosh et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more generic tactic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .

prisoners are entitled to the same level of medical care as persons living in the community , and prison health services should be able to provide treatment for problems related to drug use in conditions comparable to those offered outside prison ( CPT , 2006 ; WHO , 2007 ) .
the use of cannabis in Europe has evolved considerably over the last decade , as has the debate on how to respond appropriately to the widespread use of this drug .
moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @-@ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis related problems .
global production of cannabis resin in 2008 is estimated at between 2 200 tonnes and 9 900 tonnes ( UNODC , 2009 ) , with Morocco continuing to be the main producer .
north America continued to account for the bulk of herbal cannabis seized ( 66 % ) , while quantities of resin seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 66 % ) ( UNODC , 2009 ) .

drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
information on the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean potency of nederwiet was observed , from a peak of 20.3 % in 2004 to 16.0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .
the mean retail price of cannabis resin , in 2007 , ranged from EUR 3 to EUR 11 per gram in the 18 countries providing information , with half of them reporting values between EUR 5 and EUR 9 .

as with adults , increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
only two of the countries monitored by the EMCDDA that participated in ESPAD school surveys in 2007 ( Lithuania , Slovakia ) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lifetime cannabis use since 2003 , while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period ( 54 ) .
different methodologies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the prevalence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly cannabis use , have been tested in recent years .
it was estimated that : nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France , Greece and Slovenia ; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom ; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries .

over the past 5 years , the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 20 countries where sufficient data are available to allow analysis of trends .
of the 11 countries where a comparison of data for 2007 and 2006 was possible , Spain , France and Austria reported increases in the retail price , while the rest reported stable or decreasing prices .
last year use of the drug is much lower , with a European average of 0.5 % . these estimates suggest that around 12 million Europeans have tried amphetamines , and about 2 million have used the drug during the last year ( see Table 5 for a summary of the data ) .
76 ) Survey data on " amphetamine use " often do not distinguish between amphetamine and methamphetamine , though , as use of methamphetamine is uncommon in Europe , prevalence should typically reflect the use of amphetamine ( sulphate or dexamphetamine ) .77 ) Data from all ESPAD countries and Spain . see Figure eye @-@ 2 ( part vi ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .

Dexamphetamine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amphetamines in England and Wales , where it may be prescribed by any doctor . however , information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited .
the fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal , and to a lesser extent Spain and France , reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year ( 90 ) .
in countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
the European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.8 % ( 1 million ) .
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe , after cannabis , though levels of use vary greatly between countries .
it is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime , on average 3.9 % of adults aged 15 @-@ 64 years ( see Table 8 for a summary of the data ) .
national figures vary from 0.1 % to 8.3 % , with 12 out of 23 countries , including most central and eastern European countries , reporting low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.5 @-@ 2 % ) .
visiting nightclubs was also associated with increased cocaine use , as nearly 10 % of the 16- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds who visited a club on four or more occasions during the last month report last year use of cocaine , compared with 3.3 % among those who had not visited a club .

in 2007 , around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered outpatient treatment for primary use of crack cocaine , representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in outpatient treatment .
the first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .

for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
according to a recent Cochrane review , this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence ( Knapp et al . , 2007 ) .
in addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
0 Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002 @-@ 07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000 .
it has also launched , in collaboration with the University of Zurich , a study to test a new " one @-@ day " method using the distribution of " latency time " ( time to treatment ) in a cross @-@ sectional sample of treated heroin users .
similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seizures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . in the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @-@ related cases may also be observed .
injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 114 ) . information from the
treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e.g. Czech Republic , Germany ) .
in France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly

its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area , underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis , treatment and study of co @-@ morbidity in Europe ( Baldacchino et al . , 2009 ) .
the German Phar @-@ Mon system , which monitors a wide range of medications that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of prescription opioids , where substitution drugs play a more important role than analgesics ( Roesner and Küfner , 2007 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users ( 125 ) .
drug @-@ free treatment is a therapeutic approach , which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances , including substitution medication .
access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
to reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors .
current treatments for chronic hepatitis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response .
( 140 ) Experts from 26 EU countries , Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to drug users . ( 141 ) See Table HSR @-@ 5 ( part i ) and ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
known causes of deaths include acute toxicity , traffic accidents in particular when combined with alcohol ( EMCDDA , 2007c ) , violence , suicide among already vulnerable people , or chronic conditions due to repeated use ( e.g. cardiovascular problems in cocaine users ) .
during the period 1990 @-@ 2006 , between 6 400 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States , Croatia , Norway and Turkey , adding up to more than 135 000 deaths . in 2006 , the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths .
population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .

education about overdose risk is reported by all countries , and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users .
drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .
according to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @-@ release counselling on overdose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .

the use of opiates and cannabis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psychopharmacologically induced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tranquillisers ) tend to reduce violent impulses and aggression .
while the pharmacology of most illicit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behaviours are not fully understood although some substances , usually stimulants , are known to produce
Studies of drug @-@ related crime have often overlooked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by definition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption . addicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
most neurobiological research on addiction has focused on the role a drug @-@ released neurotransmitter called dopamine has on the repeated activation of the " reward system " - circuitry made up of a complex set of cerebral structures which act as a barometer , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .
this dysregulation would correspond either to an increased reactivity of dopaminergic neurons to specific stimuli linked to the pleasurable and addictive product or to a down @-@ regulation of dopamine signalling and a dampening of activity in the reward pathway .
progress in neurobiological research on addiction has led to the use of drugs which target the dopaminergic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in

environment , health and quality of life
environment , health and quality of life - Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas .
increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved , for example , using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental impacts of products and activities .
Clustering sectoral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve coherence , address shared challenges efficiently , maximise economic and social benefits and help avoid unintended consequences .
a further requirement is that the EEA publishes
integrate ecosystem services linked to climate change , resource use and health ; account for use of natural capital ( i.e. water , land , biodiversity , soil ) in decisions on sectoral management .

loss of biodiversity can thus lead to degradation of ' ecosystem services ' and undermine human well @-@ being .
the challenge is therefore to reduce Europe 's impact on the global environment while maintaining biodiversity at a level where ecosystem services , the sustainable use of natural resources and human wellbeing are secured .

a challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental impacts that result from resource use ; several current initiatives aim to better quantify the environmental impacts of resource use .
the issues of water quantity and quality , irrigation water demand , water @-@ use conflicts , environmental and socioeconomic aspects and risk management aspects can be better integrated in the institutional and political systems .
the overall challenge which the WFD can help tackle , if implemented fully , is to ensure the sustainable availability of good water quality , as well as managing inevitable trade @-@ offs between competing uses , such as domestic use , industry , agriculture and the environment ( see also Chapter 6 ) .

we sincerely hope that this joint report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to elaborate and refine the high nature value farmland concept , and further focus their conservation efforts .
the target is to cover ' a substantial proportion ' of such areas with rural development and agrienvironment measures by 2008 . a high nature value farmland indicator is currently under preparation within the framework of IRENA1 .
loss of seminatural vegetations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends . although many case studies exist ( see for example Veen and Seffer , 1999 ) , no reliable panEuropean trend data are currently available for plant communities and habitats .

this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Cop 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
the Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC , is a first step in the long @-@ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to Kyoto on time ) . ' Kyoto ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
if the water is off for a really long time we go to my father 's place or to my wife 's parents , ' says Barış , an economics professor at Marmara University .
governments at local and national level , desperate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water , water transfer and desalination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .
limiting temperature increases to 2 ° C
at a cost of GBP 200m , more than EUR 250m , the facility could supply 140 million litres of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .
the Water Framework Directive ( WFD ) , the defining piece of legislation on water in Europe , obliges Member States to use pricing ( charging money ) for water @-@ related services as an effective tool for promoting water conservation .
others , called ' invasive alien species ' create serious problems as pest species to gardening , agriculture , forestry as vectors of diseases or by damaging constructions such as buildings and dams .
biodiversity - the wider context ecosystems and existing native plant and animal species . the problem of invasive species is expected to worsen in the coming century through climate change , increasing trade and tourism .
today , the giant hogweed is most likely beyond eradication in Europe while early actions ( up to the 1950s ) probably would have had better prospects .
Anna suffers from asthma and her doctor has warned of the dangers of air pollution , especially on hot summer days.Anna has heard about the London fogs of the 1950s that killed 2 000 people in one week .
using maps , Anna can scan readings and forecasts for particulate matter , ozone , nitrogen dioxide , sulphur dioxide among many others . the data are relayed to the web from monitoring stations around the country .

in the EU @-@ 15 , farming causes almost half of the nitrogen pollution in rivers , 94 % of ammonia emissions and 9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
the subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
as a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
the single farm payments , under Pillar I , are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .
the Baltic was actually a freshwater lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
salinity in the Baltic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea .
in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Baltic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Baltic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integrating agricultural , fisheries and regional policies . this plan , adopted in
of the three major fished species , cod , herring , and sprat , cod is particularly sensitive to reduced salinity because salinity affects both their reproductive capacity and the availability of the preferred food for cod larvae .
knock @-@ on effects , so @-@ called ' indirect land @-@ use changes ' , would impact elsewhere in the world : as Europe cuts back on food exports , other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , etc. as well as bioenergy ) by 2020 .
the transport sector is also increasing greenhouse gas emissions and eating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that biofuels make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certified as sustainable .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' hazardous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .The EU 's long term aim is that each Member State should dispose of its own waste domestically ( the ' proximity principle ' ) .
Commission , so the overview at an EU level is unclear.If more detailed information , especially on the types of waste shipped , were reported , the overview would allow a much better assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of the shipments . it could help us to tell whether waste shipments

the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shipped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don 't know whether it is bad for the environment .
the simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be replicated on a much grander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and empower the public environmentally .
they are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( GMES ) and the Shared Environmental Information System ( SEIS ) .GMES will use satellites and sensors on the ground , floating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment .
