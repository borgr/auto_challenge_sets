European agencies working across Europe for you
Some sixteen specialised and decentralised EU agencies have been established to support the EU Member States and their citizens .
The objectives of the individual agencies are many and varied.Each agency is unique and fulfils an individual function .
However , there are a number of general aims underlying an agency 's operation as a whole :

It does this by providing information on and analyses of vocational education and training systems , policies , research and practice .
Cedefop presents its information in electronic and printed media and also brings people together through the study visits , conferences and seminars it organises .
Cedefop 's information is targeted at vocational education and training policy @-@ makers , researchers and practitioners in the EU and beyond .
Cedefop work programmes and the latest annual report are available on the Internet : www.cedefop.eu.int.
Information is also available on the Cedefop staff and management board as well as its organisation .
Cedefop also operates an interactive website called the European Training Village : www.trainingvillage.gr
European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions
: " The Foundation is a European Union body set up in 1975 to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions in Europe .
It provides fi ndings , knowledge and advice from independent and comparative research , to governments , employers , trade unions and the European Commission .
Established : 1975Acting Director : Willy Buschak Staff : 100
Foundation research reports can be downloaded free of charge directly from the website or ordered online at www.eurofound.eu.int.
The Foundation has a tripartite Administrative Board , made up of representatives from public authorities ( governments and the European Commission ) , employer organisations and trade unions .
: " The European Environment Agency ( EEA ) is the EU body dedicated to providing sound and independent information on the environment .
We are a main information source for those involved in developing , adopting , implementing and evaluating environmental policy , as well as the general public .
Our aim is to help the EU and member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment , integrating environmental considerations into economic policies and moving towards sustainability
Information for improving Europe 's environment
The EEA and Eionet were established by Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 1210 / 90 of 7 May 1990 with later amendments ( 1999,2003 ) .
The Agency is located in Copenhagen and by 2004 had a staff of approximately 115 .
The Agency 's 2004 budget is about EUR 31 million .
Membership is open to countries that are not Member States of the European Union .
We now ( 2004 ) have 31 member countries : 25 EU Member States together with Bulgaria , Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway , Romania and Turkey .
European Training Foundation
As an international centre of expertise , the ETF collaborates with other European and international institutions and organisations such as the World Bank , OECD , the ILO , the European Investment Bank and UNESCO .
: " The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is the hub of drug @-@ related information in the European Union .
Among the Centre 's target groups are policy @-@ makers , who use this information to help formulate coherent national and Community drug strategies .
Also served are professionals and researchers working in the drugs field and , more broadly , the European media and general public .
At the heart of the Centre 's work is the task of improving the comparability of drug information across Europe and devising the methods and tools required to achieve this .
As a result of efforts to date , countries can now view how they fit into the wider European picture and examine common problems and goals .
A key feature of the drug phenomenon is its shifting , dynamic nature , and tracking new developments is a central task of the EMCDDA .
Meanwhile online Country situation summaries provide a rich pool of national drug @-@ related data .
EMCDDA , your reference point on drugs in Europe
The EMCDDA works on the assumption that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs .
Although the Centre cannot propose any kind of policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @-@ making through its analyses , instruments and standards .
: " The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) contributes to the protection of public and animal health by ensuring that medicines for human and veterinary use are safe , effective and of high quality .
It cooperates closely with international partners , reinforcing the EU contribution to global harmonisation .
The EMEA began its activities in 1995 , when the European system for authorising medicinal products was introduced providing for a centralised and a mutual recognition procedure .
The EMEA has a role in both , but is primarily involved in the centralised procedure .
From the end of 2004 onwards a new Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products ( HMPC ) will provide scientific opinions on traditional herbal medicines .
The scientific work of the EMEA and its committees is underpinned by a network of 3 500 European experts .
Ten years after its inauguration , the EMEA is implementing new legislation that will significantly broaden the mandate of the Agency .
Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market ( Trade Marks and Designs )
The Community trade mark and the Community registered design are the gateway to a single market .
Their unitary nature means that formalities and management can be kept simple : a single application , a single administrative centre and a single file to be managed .
A uniform law applies to trade marks and designs , thereby providing strong and unique protection throughout the European Union .
The simplification results in considerably reduced costs as compared with the overall costs of national registration in all countries of the European Union .
When ideas take shape , it 's time to protect them

Practical guide Some common questions Lodging a complaint Competition authorities Information on competition policy
Preface he competition policy pursued by the European Commission has a direct impact on thedaily life of the citizens of the European Union .
T wider access to air transport and the possibility of buying a car in the EU country in which pricesare lowest are tangible results .
Other , less visible , areas of Community competition policy alsoproduce positive effects for the public .
For example , merger control ensures a diversity of mass @-@ market consumer goods and low prices for the final consumer .
Likewise , by contributing to economic and social cohesion , the monitoring of State aid helps to promote viable anddurable jobs throughout the Union .
Whether they be consumers , savers , users of public services , employees or taxpayers , the Union 's citizens enjoy the fruits of the competition policy in thevarious aspects of their everyday life .
Requiringfirms to compete with each other fosters innovation , reduces production costs , increaseseconomic efficiency and , consequently , enhances the competitiveness of the European economy , particularly vis @-@ à @-@ vis its main trading partners .
Firms stimulated by competition thus offer productsand services which are competitive in terms of price and quality .
The propagation of thecompetitive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabric of the internal market and , in so doing , provides clear back @-@ up to employment policies .
Secondly , greater competition allows the consumer to choose from a wider range of productsand services at lower prices .
Thus , the same policy of liberalisation has had concrete effects forusers in terms of lower prices and access to new services .
A recent study has shown that sometelephone charges have fallen by 35 % .
The European Commission has exclusive power to monitor the State aid granted by the Member States " public authorities .
Aid is in principle prohibited by the Treaty if , by favouring certain firms , it is liable to cause damage to their competitors in other Member States , which in some casesmight go as far as to jeopardise their very survival and , consequently , the jobs of their
Only if aid is justified by the existence of a Community interest will the Commissiongrant exemption from this general principle of prohibition .
In some cases , State aid merely leads to activities which no longer meet the requirements of economic efficiency being maintained artificially , or to competition with efficient firms in the same sector being distorted .
Public aid sometimes has a purely placebo effect on firms in difficulty .
For example , 30 % of assisted firms in the former German Democratic Republichad closed down within two years of receiving aid .
I have asked for the establishment of an aid register listingall of the Commission 's decisions concerning State aid , and of a scoreboard which would enableit to be seen whether Member States are complying with the State aid rules .
We must alsoimprove the economic analysis of aid granted in order better to evaluate its cost and impact onthe internal market .
I am convinced that transparency will enable the public and itsrepresentatives to become more involved in aid @-@ monitoring policy .
It enhances the quality and variety of goodsplaced on the market , fosters technological innovation and economic performance and , finally , promotes fair prices for users .
However , the Commission 's competition policy is not limited to protecting consumers from thedangers that face them .
It also seeks to preserve and stimulate their ability to operate on themarket in such a way as to contribute to the competitive process .
In conclusion , the Commission and its departments responsible for competition encourage theactive participation of consumers and their organisations .
Given their knowledge of the day @-@ to @-@ day functioning of markets , in particular those in mass @-@ market consumer goods , consumerorganisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact .
Such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which distort competition .
This brochure has the dual objective of informing the public of the real benefits it can expectfrom European competition policy and arousing its interest and canvassing its help inimplementing that policy .
I hope that the European public will respond favourably to this request .
I am convinced that a rigorous application of competition policy is the best way of guaranteeingeconomic freedom .
Economic freedom , within a proper regulatory framework , is a precondition for the development of a free society .
Freedom of competition is thus a publicfreedom .
It impacts not only on the economic environment but also on the organisation ofsociety at large .
It is in this way that competition policy is a " people 's " policy .
A brief outline
Member States are to adopt an economic policy " conducted in accordancewith the principle of an open market economy with free competition . "
The Community 's competition policy pursues a precise goal , which is to defendand develop effective competitionin the common market .
Competition is abasic mechanism of the market economyinvolving supply ( producers , traders ) and demand ( intermediate customers , consumers ) . Suppliers offer goods orservices on the market in an endeavour to meet demand .
Demand seeks thebest ratio between quality and pricefor the products it requires . The mostefficient response emerges as a result of a contest between suppliers .
Thus , competition leads everybody individually to seek out the means of striking thisbalance between quality and price in order to meet demand to the best possible
The Community 'scompetition policypursues a precise goal , which is to defend anddevelop effectivecompetition in thecommon market .
extent . Competition is therefore a simple and efficientmeans of guaranteeing consumers a level of excellencein terms of the quality and price of products andservices .
It also forces firms to strive for competitivenessand economic efficiency .
This consolidates the Community 's industrial and commercial fabric so that itis able to confront the competitiveness of our mainpartners and to put Community firms in a position tosucceed in markets around the world .
European competition policy is based on a Community legislative frameworkessentially provided by the EC Treaty ( Articles 81 to 90 ) .
Further rules areprovided by a Council regulation known as the merger regulation .
On the basisof this body of law , competition policy focuses on four main areas of action .
• The elimination of agreements which restrict competition and of abuses of adominant position ( e.g. price @-@ fixing agreements between competitors ) .
• The control of mergers between firms ( e.g. a merger between two large groupswhich results in their dominating the market ) .
• The liberalisation of monopolistic economic sectors ( e.g. telecommunications ) .
• The monitoring of State aid ( e.g. the prohibition of a State grant designed to keepa loss @-@ making firm in business even though it has no prospect of recovery ) .
Community law strives to defend the common market and stimulate competitionwithin what is a vast economic area .
It does not enter into play until such timeas trade between Member States is affectedby the practices in question .
Forexample , a price @-@ fixing agreement between bakers in a given town will not haveany impact on the Community market , and European law is therefore notapplicable to this kind of situation .
However , such an agreement would probablybe covered by domestic law .
The condition that trade be affected is central to all Community provisions .
The European Commissionhas the power to deal with these matters .
In some cases , this power is shared with the Member States " own competitionauthorities and law courts ( Articles 81 and 82 ) , while in others it liesexclusivelywith the Commission ( merger control , monitoring of State aid ) .
It is shared when a rule is generally applicable throughout the Community .
Both the Commission and the courts in the Member States have a duty toenforce such rules .
By contrast , it is exclusive when the legislative provision inquestion expressly stipulates that this is the case .
For the control of large @-@ scalemergers , the Member States considered it necessary to create a one @-@ stop shop.They appointed the European Commission to that end .
For State aid , thedecision whether or not aid granted by Member States is illegal can be takenonly by a supranational and independent authority .
Finally , it should be added that most Member States have their own domesticlawsto counter anti @-@ competitive practices ( restrictive agreements , abuses of adominant position , and mergers ) .
National law makes it possible to take actionagainst practices which do not have any impact on trade between Member States .
A rigorous procedure is laid down in various implementing regulations .
Theyconfer powers of investigationon the Commission 's agents .
Due processisguaranteed , as is commercial confidentiality .
Commission policy would be ineffective if its monitoring and control activitieswere not accompanied by decisionsand penalties .
In the area of its anti @-@ trustoperations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibitan agreement orto issue an injunctionthat a restrictive practice be stopped , but also to imposefineson firms found guilty of anti @-@ competitive conduct .
The amount of thesefinesis calculated according to the gravity and duration of the infringement.Some of the most serious practices are price cartels or abusive conduct by firmsholding a virtual monopoly .
An appeal against a Commission decision may be lodged with the Court of First Instance or the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
Restrictiveagreements andabuse of a dominant position
Restrictive agreements
Some agreements between enterprises impair competition .
The most familiarexample is an agreement on prices , or cartel , whereby firms fix price levelsjointly so that consumers are unable to take advantage of competition betweensuppliers to obtain competitive prices .
The result for the final consumer is anincrease in market prices .
Other agreements have the object or effect of fixingother conditions for the operation of markets : for example , they may allocateproduction quotas to firms or share markets between them .
Agreements of thistype are prohibited in the European Community because they distortcompetition and are detrimental to the various operators on the market .
forms of distribution . In those circumstances , enterprises no longer have to be reallycompetitive and have no incentive to innovate or reduce production costs .
The crisis thus affects employees , subcontractors and traders.Moreover , artificially high prices affect the costs of intermediate consumers , who are adversely affected by their suppliers " anti @-@ competitive behaviour .
The dynamism of those enterprises is therefore dampened .
Lastly , finalconsumers pay more for products or services , have a restricted choice and donot benefit from technical or economic progress .
The anti @-@ competitive behaviour of a few firms thus harms all operators andjustifies the intervention of the authorities .
In each of the last three years , the European Commission has dealt on average with over 400 cases concerningagreements restricting competition .
Community law ( Article 81 )
Agreements restricting competition are prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty .
If an agreement fulfils the following conditions , it is void : it is concluded between firms or " undertakings " ;
• • it leads to an appreciable restriction of competition on the market .
It may fixpurchase or selling prices or other trading conditions ; it may limit production , markets , technical development or investment .
It may also share markets orsources of supply between competitors .
Lastly , it may apply discriminatory conditions to firms that are not parties to the agreement , placing them at acompetitive disadvantage .
An agreement is considered to restrict competition if itinterferes appreciably with the normal interplay of supply and demand .
However , some agreements may encourage competition , because they promote technical progress or improve distribution , for example .
Under Community law , those agreements can be exempted from the prohibition because they ultimately have a beneficial effect on the market .
Four tests must be satisfied if an agreement is to qualify for an exemption :
• it must improve the production or distribution of goods or promote economic
Article progress ; it must allow intermediate or final consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit ;
• • the restriction of competition must be indispensable to the attainment of the firsttwo conditions ;
• it must not eliminate competition in respect of a substantial proportion of theproducts or services in question .
Some examples of actiontaken by the Commission
In October 1998 , the Commission terminated a cartel between producers of distance @-@ heating pipes , which had jointly fixed prices and terms for tenders to public authorities .
The cartel was set up in Denmark at the end of 1990 and subsequently extended to Germany and other EU Member States .
From 1994 , the entire European market was covered .
V of the cartel shared national markets and jointly fixed prices for distance @-@ heating
Under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exempted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distributionagreements for example .
At present only the European Commission can exercise the power to exempt arestrictive agreement under Article 81 .
To obtain an individual exemption , firmsmust notify their agreements to the European Commission .
In recent years , the Commission has received on average over 200 such notifications annually .
In 1999 , it suggested terminating this centralised notification of all agreementsbetween enterprises .
Many agreements that are notified do not involve seriousproblems for competition .
These restrictive agreements are automatically void , and the Commission haspower to prohibit them and impose fines on the offending firms .
In certain conditions , it may also exempt some agreements that restrict competition .
In addition , it enjoys investigatory powers entitling it to inspect firms " premises insearch of evidence of secret agreements .
The Commission imposed fines totalling approximately EUR92 million on the members of the cartel .
In this case , the anti @-@ competitive practice harmed firms outside the cartel , which were systematically excludedfrom calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
Cartel prohibited in the sugar sector
Two sugar producers and two sugar traders in the United Kingdom adopted aconcerted strategy for increasing prices on the sugar market .
The result of thisagreement , for the final consumer , was purchase prices that were higher thanthey would have been with free competition .
In 1998 , the Commission thereforeprohibited the agreement and imposed fines totalling more than EUR 50 millionon the firms .
Open will offer new digital interactive television services inthe United Kingdom .
After the new venture has been set up , businesses such asbanks , supermarkets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers interactive services via television . Access to the services will be through a decoder .
Before the Commission authorised the agreement , it satisfied itself that competition would continue after Open was set up .
For example , commitments given by Open 's shareholders will provide access to the market forthird parties .
Third parties will have access to Open decoders and to BSkyB 's cinema and sport channels .
Lastly , decoders in competition with Open decoderscan be sold on the market without hindrance .
In this case , the Commissionsought to make it easier for new digital interactive television services to developwhile at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market .
The benefit to British consumers is therefore twofold .
Abuse of adominant position
Efficient businesses are run with a view to conquering markets , to the pointwhere they may establish very strong positions indeed .
Holding a dominantposition is not wrong in itself .
It is the result of the firm 's own effectiveness .
But if the firm exploits its power to stifle competition , this is an anti @-@ competitive practice which constitutes abuse .
It is therefore the abuse of the dominantposition that is wrong .
Those practices interfere withcompetition .
The Commission can act against them and punish their perpetratorsseverely .
Citizens have good reason to be apprehensive of abuses of this kind , whichresult in higher prices , restrictions on the availability of products and services and unfair trading conditions .
Community law
Article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibits the abuse of a dominant position . For the article to apply , the following conditions must be fulfilled .
• The firm holds a dominant position .
• The firm dominates the common market or a " substantial part " of the common market .
There is no exemption available for abuse of a dominant position .
The Commission can adopt a decision prohibiting an abuse and fining theoffending firm .
In 1998 and 1999 , the Commission adopted around a dozendecisions prohibiting abuses .
Some examples of action taken by the Commission
Abuse of a dominant position on the ice @-@ cream distribution market
As a result of a complaint submitted by Mars , the Commission found that Unilever had abused its dominant position .
Unilever provided freezer cabinets toits Irish distributors free of any direct charge on condition that they stocked only Unilever products there .
Irish consumers therefore had a very restricted choice ofice @-@ creams .
The Commission considered that having regard to Unilever 'sdominant position on the market the requirement of exclusive use constitutedan abuse .
Abuse of a dominant position on the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies
Acting on a complaint by Virgin Airways , the Commission found in July 1999that British Airways had abused a dominant position .
The abuse consisted ofestablishing a system of brand loyalty , which meant that the market in airtransport services provided by travel agencies was closed to British Airways 'competitors .
British Airways offered some British travel agencies extracommission if they equalled or exceeded their previous year 's sales of British Airways " tickets .
The effect of the system was toreinforce agencies " brand loyalty to British Airwaysand to discourage them from offering the services of
/ other airlines .
British Airways held a dominant position , so that the systemformed a real barrier to competing airlines " access to the market .
Since theagencies favoured the airline paying the highest commission , consumers werealmost always offered British Airways " tickets even if competitors " services weremore advantageous .
The Commission therefore considered that this practice , which affected the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies , constituted an abuse of a dominant position .
Abuse of a dominant position in the organisation of the Football World Cup
On 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Frenchcommittee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 1998.The committee , the CFO , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event thatincluded ticket sales .
The Commission found that the arrangements for ticketsales for the final matches were discriminatory and constituted an abuse of adominant position .
Persons not resident in France who wished to see the finalswere thus at a severedisadvantage compared withpersons resident in France.The Commission thereforeruled against the CFO .
When companies combine via a merger , an acquisition or the creation of a jointventure , this generally has a positive impact on markets .
They thus become more efficient on the market .
Competitionintensifies and the final consumer will benefit from higher @-@ quality goods at fairerprices .
Mergers which create orstrengthen a dominantposition , however , areprohibited by the Treatyin order to preventensuing abuses .
Mergers which create or strengthen a dominantposition , however , are prohibited by the Treaty inorder to prevent ensuing abuses . A firm is in adominant position when it is able to act on themarket without having to take account of thereaction of its competitors , suppliers orcustomers .
For example , such a firm can increaseits prices above those of its competitors withoutfearing any loss of profit .
All market players andespecially consumers stand to lose from theemergence of this kind of dominant structure , which is likely to result in higher prices , a narrower choice of goods or scarcityof innovation .
That is why the European Union has set up an advance vettingsystem for mergers with a Community dimension that enables it to prohibit aplanned merger if necessary .
Identical systems have been set up in the Member States for investigating mergers of national dimension .
Public opinion does not always understand why the Commission approvesmergers and acquisitions when they involve loss of jobs .
It must be borne inmind that the Commission 's objective in the merger control field is to preserve asituation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be aguarantee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
It may be that , in the short term , efforts to improve the competitiveness of firms by means of mergers oracquisitions involve restructuring and thus loss of jobs .
However , this does notchange the fact that improving firms " competitiveness is the only effective wayto ensure the growth needed to create business and stable and lasting jobs .
( Regulation ( EEC ) No 4064 / 89 )
The Community 's system for monitoring this type of transaction has beengoverned by the merger regulation since 1990 .
The regulation is based on thefollowing principles .
• The European Commission has exclusive power to investigate mergers with a
The Community dimension of a merger or acquisition isassessed using thresholds based on the turnover of the companies involved.The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EUR 5 000 million ) and the Community @-@ wide threshold ( EUR 250 million ) .
Below these thresholds , mergercontrol is carried out by the authorities in the Member States under their ownlegislation .
• Mergers and acquisitions with a Community dimension have to be notified to the Commission for its agreement before they are put into effect .
Since theentry into force of the merger regulation , the Commission has seen thenumber of notifications grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
The Commission currently receives close on 300 notifications every year .
• After an initial scrutiny period of one month , the Commission decides either to
Regulation authorise the transaction or , if it thinks that a dominant position might be created or strengthened , to initiate a four @-@ month investigation procedure .
• At the end of this procedure , the Commission may authorise the merger
( EEC ) No 4064 / 89 conditionally or unconditionally , or it may prohibit it , for example in cases where the companies have not been able to propose appropriate solutions to theconcerns raised by the Commission .
" Conditions " attached to the authorisationfrequently entail the sale to competitors of assets , shares in other companies , patents , etc .
( more than 90 % ) .
In a market in the process of integration , mergers whichcreate or strengthen a dominant position are , in fact , quite rare .
• Most cases going through the four @-@ month investigation procedure are resolved by a conditional authorisation .
Insome cases , the merger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen adominant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a solutionto the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
Mergers in the retail distribution sector
In recent years , numerous large retailers have notified merger plans to the European Commission .
Examples are the food retailers Kesko / Tuko in Finland ( 1997 ) , Rewe / Mainl in Austria ( 1999 ) and Carrefour / Promodès in France and Spain ( 2000 ) .
In both the Finnish and Austrian cases , the Commissionconsidered that the merger of these retail chains would have created adominant position ; in the Finnish case , it decided to prohibit the transaction , while in the Austrian case it accepted the remedies proposed by the companies , which consisted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors .
The merger of Carrefour and Promodès was authorised subject to thedivestment of a majorshareholding in acompetitor .
But theanalysis of competitiveconditions at locallevel was left to thenational competitionauthorities , since themerger involved aseries of very localisedcompetition problems .
The Commission thus ensured thatcompetition waspreserved or restored in order to allow consumers to continue to benefit from achoice of outlets , attractive prices and a diverse range of consumer goods .
A merger in the insurance sector
Insurance policyholders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fromthe remedies proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .
The initialanalysis of the takeover led the Commission to form serious doubts about itscompatibility with Community law .
It would have given the new firm sizeableshares of the market for the supply of various life @-@ assurance products in Italy .
In addition , the investigation revealed links between the two firms and theirmain competitors that could have induced them to coordinate their behaviourin the insurance and investment fields .
Effective competition was thus restored in Italy in afinancial sector that primarily concerns the public .
A merger in the petroleum products sector
French citizens and people travelling across France have everything to gain from the Commission 's action in the TotalFina / Elf Aquitaine case .
The merging of theoperations of the two main players in the French petroleum products sector wouldhave created a dominant position onseveral markets . After the merger , TotalFina
The merging of theoperations of the twomain players in the French petroleumproducts sector wouldhave created a dominantposition on severalmarkets .
The supermarkets have helped to reduce fuel prices in France and to keep them at fairlylow levels .
Furthermore , the combination of TotalFina and Elf service stations on French motorways would have given the new group a market share of some 60 % .
The Commission considered that this level of market power would have pushedup prices in a market where they were already high .
Lastly , TotalFina and Elfwould have become the leader on the market for LPG , used for heating . In orderto resolve the competition problems identified , TotalFina / Elf undertook to sell alarge proportion of the operations concerned to competitors .
For example , itproposed selling 70 motorway service stations in France to competitors .
In this way , the Commission ensured that the French fuel markets remainedcompetitive and that consumers continued to benefit from the supply ofpetroleum products at fair prices .
These special rights generally correspondto responsibilities linked to the performance of the public service entrusted tothe undertaking .
However , the special rights must not go beyond what is necessary for the performance of that service .
Otherwise , from the point of view of Community law , they would createsituations that restrict competition .
The public authorities in the Member States may grantspecial rights , in particularmonopoly rights , to public orprivate undertakings toperform services of generaleconomic interest .
Frequently , these monopolies have been innetwork industries - transport , energy andtelecommunications .
In these sectors , a distinction must be made between theinfrastructure and the services provided overthis infrastructure .
While it is often difficult toestablish a second , competing infrastructure , for reasons linked to investment costs andeconomic efficiency , it is possible and desirableto create competitive conditions in respect ofthe services provided .
The Commission hastherefore developed the concept of separating infrastructure from commercial activities .
The infrastructure is thus merely the vehicle of competition .
This is the generalprinciple on which the Community liberalisation directives are based .
The process of opening up these sectors tocompetition has a positiveimpact for intermediateusers , and also for finalconsumers .
In a sector of the economy which is experiencingrapid growth driven by the emergence of the Internet and of electroniccommerce , the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source ofcompetitiveness and new jobs .
Community law ( Article 86 )
The Commission has various means of applying the principle of opening upmonopoly markets .
The Commission checks that Member States , when they grant special orexclusive rights , comply with the Community competition rules .
Depending on the circumstances , it may itself adopt a European liberalisation directive , or propose that such a directive be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament .
A directive is a piece of Community legislation which sets a common objective to be attained by all Member States , one that each Member State will incorporate
Article 86 into its own legislation and enforce .
It was in this way that the European Unioninitiated the opening @-@ up of the telecommunications , transport , postal , gas andelectricity markets .
The Commission checks that these objectives are actuallyachieved .
Mobile telephones in Spain
The liberalisation of mobile telephony in Europe wasintroduced by a 1996 Community directive opening upthe mobile and personal communications market tocompetition .
EUR 510 million for the right to operate on the Spanish market , while Telefónica , the State operator , had been allowed to provide mobile telephone services without
In restoring thebalance between Telefónica and Airtel Móvil , the Commissionsought to stimulatecompetition in theinterest of mobile telephone users in Spain .
advantage over its new competitor , enabling it tostrengthen its dominant position on the mobiletelephony market .
The Commission thereforerequired the Spanish Government to reimbursethe EUR 510 million to Airtel Móvil or to proposeequivalent corrective measures .
In April 1997 , the Commission accepted the correctivemeasures proposed by the Spanish Government with a view to ending the distortion of competition .
The Commission decided that there was no necessary relation betweenthe stated cultural policy objective of preserving pluralism in the Flemish printedpress and the granting in Flanders of a monopoly on commercial television to VTM .
These measures ultimately constituted a form of discrimination withprotectionist consequences that also affected Belgian viewers from the Flemish Community , whose choice of television stations was restricted .
Scrutiny of State aid
State aid that distorts intra @-@ Community competition is prohibited by the Treaty.By giving certain firms or products favoured treatment to the detriment of otherfirms or products , it seriously disrupts normal competitive forces .
Aid given by public authorities most commonly supports a firm , an economicactivity or a region in order to promote its development or alleviate its difficulties .
At first sight , particularly from the recipient 'sangle , State aid might well seem to be beneficial .
But very often all it achieves is to delay inevitablerestructuring operations without helping the recipientactually to return to competitiveness .
development or diversification programme .
Unsubsidised firms can even run intodifficulties that will impact on their competitiveness and ability to keep theiremployees in jobs .
Ultimately , then , the entire market will suffer from State aid , and the general competitiveness of the European economy is imperilled .
Aid to particularlybackward regions can help them catch up on their development backlog and become equalcompetitors with the other , more developedregions .
Once these regions have removed theirhandicaps , however , there is no further justificationfor continuing to pay development aid there .
That would be discriminatory in relation todeveloped regions where aid schemes do notoperate .
Regional development aid would then be illegal in the Commission 'sview and would run counter to the Treaty 's objective of economic and socialcohesion .
Likewise , aid to restructure firms can be authorised if it is a one @-@ offmeasure accompanied by a restructuring plan that is capable of restoring thefirm 's health and viability .
The Commission considers that the figure is too high .
The Commission 's monitoring of State aid has a considerable impact on day @-@ to @-@ day life and offers three main beneficial effects .
It confines aid schemes to what is strictly necessary and thus avoids waste of public funds .
By preventingdistortions of intra @-@ Community competition that would be deleterious to thesingle market , it boosts economic growth in the Union and promotesemployment as a result .
Aid can take a variety of forms : grants and interest relief , of course , but also taxrelief .
Aid can be given in the form of a State guarantee or holding , or evenprovision by the State of goods and services on preferential terms .
Article 87allows certain forms of aid : • aid having a social character , granted to individual consumers ;
• aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptionaloccurrences ;
• aid designed to :
- facilitate the development of certain activities or areas ,
- promote culture and heritage conservation ; where , in the last two cases , such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common
The Commission has adopted a number of documents to clarify its State aid policy .
They are called " guidelines " or " frameworks . "
They concern regions lagging behind in terms of development , R & D , employment and training , small and medium @-@ sized businesses , protection of the environment and the rescue and and 88 restructuring of firms in difficulty .
The Commission generally takes a favourable approach to such schemes as long as they do not distort competition to an extentincompatible with the common interest .
The Commission also scrutinises aid schemes illegally implemented by the Member States without prior notification and without awaiting authorisation .
It isoften apprised of such schemes via complaints from firms . Incompatible schemesare banned , and the offending Member State may well be required to recover thesums paid out .
The recipient of unlawful aid will have to pay it back .
Certain forms of State financial support for firms can be anecessary means of tackling structural handicaps and excess costs flowing fromlocation in such areas .
The objective of this aid is to help alleviate or evenremove a number of problems ( employment , development , etc . ) facing certainurban areas .
Residents there are the immediate beneficiaries of such aid , whichthe Commission looks on with some favour , particularly where it accompaniesother Community programmes for the development of poorer areas .
Regional aid for small businesses In February 1998 , the Commission approved aid totalling EUR 1.89 million forthe development of small tourism businesses in the area of Doñana , in southern Spain .
Their chief purpose was to provideincentives for investment in the formation of newtourism businesses and the creation of jobs inthat industry .
They thus contributed to thesustainable development of this relatively poorregion of the Union .
Andalusia is a region eligiblefor special status as regards State aid under the Treaty , given that its standard of living is wellbelow the Community average .
Aid authorised conditionally
Air transport Most national airlines have responded to the liberalisation of air transport in Europeby developing restructuring and recapitalisation plans to restore theircompetitiveness .
In 1997 , the Commission gave conditional authorisation forpayment of aid worth EUR 1 400 million to Alitalia .
The Commission consideredthat the aid would be conducive to the developmentof air transport in Europe without adverselyaffecting trade between Member States to anextent contrary to the common interest .
It actedwith the twofold concern to preserve a company inthe process of return to viability on the air transportmarket without jeopardising competition : consumerswould benefit both from Alitalia 's services and from those of its competitors .
Motor industry The German authorities wanted to give Volkswagen aid of EUR 398 million forinvestment at two production sites in Germany .
Thus , it adopted a partial negativedecision for an amount of EUR 123 million .
The Commission has always soughtto ensure that operating conditions in the motor industry are fair throughout Europe .
The effect of this balanced policy is to preserve competitiveness andemployment throughout the common market for the benefit of all thoseemployed in the motor industry .
And by dissuading public authorities fromgiving systematic assistance , the Commissioncontributes to reducing public expenditure and thushelps to lower the general tax burden .
A merger between two supermarket chains is reported in thepress .
The new group will be the largest in the country and oneof the top three in the Union .
In my local area , there are onlytwo large supermarkets , each belonging to one of the twochains in question .
At the moment , there is keen competitionbetween the two supermarkets in prices and promotional offers.Am I right in fearing that , after the merger , this situation willchange and local competition will disappear ?
If so , what couldthe Commission do ?
In this case , the Commission has the power toprohibit the merger if it has a Community dimension and leads to the strengthening of a dominant position .
Community dimension , the domestic competition authorities will as a rule have the power to take similar action .
This situation is illustrated by the Kesko / Tuko ,
What scope is there for buying a car in another Community country ?
difference in the price of the same vehicle depending on whether it is bought in my country of residence or in the other Member State .
My dealer has told me that I could not buy thevehicle abroad as the manufacturer forbids its dealers frommaking cross @-@ border sales .
Is this possible ? Is there a competition problem here ?
Petrol prices have increased at filling stations .
Is this the result of a restrictive practice ?
Petrol prices went up by the same amount on the same day in allthe petrol stations in my region .
Is this price rise an example ofan agreement that restricts competition ?
Should I complain tothe European Commission ?
A simultaneous and identical rise in prices is not necessarily the result of concertedaction .
It may be the consequence of an increase in tax or in the price of crude oil , for example because of an international crisis .
Where there is no explanation of thiskind , it might be that the price rise is the result of an agreement between fillingstation owners or oil companies .
An investigation would have to be conducted todetermine whether or not this was the case .
If a simultaneous and identical riseoccurs locally , it is probably more appropriate to contact your domestic authoritiesthan to report the matter to the Commission .
For instance , at the end of November 1999 , the Italian competition authority launched an investigation into asuspected agreement between petroleum @-@ product manufacturers in the fueldistribution sector in Italy .
Prices have risen simultaneously inseveral Community countries - is this asign of a restrictive practice ?
Every year I go on holiday to a Mediterranean island .
I usuallytake a ferry run by the Ulysses line , which offers the mostattractive prices of the three companies operating at the port in question .
increased steeply and the three companies had aligned theirprices .
Is this the result of an anti @-@ competitive agreement ? ?
The combination of a price rise and the alignment of prices between the threecompanies - the only three operating at the port - would seem to indicateconcerted action by the three firms .
If several Member States are involved , it might be advisable to inform the European Commission .
Certain perfumes are on sale only in a perfume shop .
Whatever happened to consumer choice ?
My wife asked me to buy a French perfume for my mother @-@ in- law 's birthday .
I tried to find it in a supermarket , but the sales
¿ assistant told me it was sold only in perfume shops .
Are theexclusive rights enjoyed by these shops legal ?
In the case of perfume shops , this service consistsof providing customer advice , enabling customers to test the products and givingout samples .
Such agreements are authorised because they are intended toimprove the distribution of goods .
In the face of redundancies , what justification is there for the Commission
declaring government aid illegal ?
The Commission has declared illegal the government aid grantedto a firm where I am employed .
The firm is going to have to payback the aid to the government .
We fear that this decision maylead to redundancies .
I do not understand the Commission 'sattitude .
However , the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the viability of firms . On the contrary , the goal is to ensure that firms recover a lasting vitality .
The Commission condemns State aid which serves to delay the restructuring measures needed to restore firms " competitiveness and to maintain artificially jobs that will soon disappear .
It condemns such aid all the more as it distorts competition vis @-@ à @-@ vis firms or regions which have carried out restructuring measures without the benefit of such aid .
Thus , aid granted to a firm in order temporarily to save its business and the jobs it provides may cause difficulties for several firms and thousands of workers that receive no government aid .
However , the Commission is in favour of aid for the restructuring of firms in difficulty , provided that it leads to the long @-@ term restoration of the firms " competitiveness .
How does the public benefit from theliberalisation of services of generalinterest ?
When sectors previously under a monopoly are opened up tocompetition , does this not undermine services of generalinterest ?
Private firms have different objectives from publicservices and I am afraid that the quest for profit may promptthese firms to abandon unprofitable activities or to be lessrigorous on matters of safety and public health .
What positiveeffects can the public eventually expect from liberalisation ?
In some sectors , for example air transport and telecommunications , liberalisationhas clearly brought benefits to consumers , in terms of prices and the services on offer , without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
X services in geographically remote areas .
Basic services such as compulsory education or social security are therefore excluded in principle fromthe liberalisation process .
The Commission also encourages Member States to setup watchdog bodies to regulate liberalised markets in order to prevent practiceswhich would harm intermediate and final consumers .
So the public has gained agreat deal from the policy of liberalisation : lower prices , a wider range of services , more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny .
If you find that competition is appreciably affected as a result , you may file a complaint .
Member States , you should contact the domestic competition authorities or law courtsonly , on the basis of the domestic competition law of the
How do I refer a case to the European Commission ?
Once you have answered these questions , what course of action can you consider taking ?
Basically , you have two choices .
You may bring the problem to the attention of a consumer organisation.If the restriction of competition appreciably affects the common market , it is likely that the consumer organisation will already have received a number of similar complaints or letters .
It may then contact other national or
European associations and submit a duly substantiated complaint . It may file a complaint on behalf of consumers in the Union and establish the Community interest in the case .
For the sake of efficiency , both for the individual and for the
# authorities , it would seem preferable to choose this collective course of action .
When addressing a complaintto the European Commission , whether it be an individual or a collective complaint , a simple letterwill suffice .
It must contain the following information :
• the complainant 's name and address ;
• the identity of the firm ( s ) in question ;
• evidence of the complainant 's legitimate interest in the matter ;
• a clear description of the subject matter of the complaint and a
% statement of the reasons for thinking that the practice in question infringes the rules of Community competition law .
# will the European Commission take ?
Once it has received the complaint , the European Commission may act in one of two ways .
Commission , after going through the requisite procedural stages , will adopt a decision which may prohibit agreements , order an end to the offending
/ practices or impose fines .

Enlargement and pollution
Rescue call for the Blue Danube
Manoela Georgieva , President of the International Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea , EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallström , and Stanko Nick , President of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River .
Growing importance n1867 , Joh an n Strauss wrote awaltzthatwas tobecome his mostfamous

Today , more than100years after the Waltz King 's death , his melody lives on.But Strauss might notrecognise the riverthatinspiredhim , for die Schöne Blaue Donau , the " beautiful Blue Danube , " hasturned grey .
Furthermore , the Danube " s strategicimportance to the EU will grow in future , withthe forthcoming enlargement .
Untilnow , the Danube has beenacrucial linkfor Central Europe as well as the borderbetweenthe EU andthe Balkans and Black Searegion .
Withenlargement , the Danube will be acentral axis of Europeandthe Black Seawill become acoastalarea of the Union .

When the mass of algae degrades , itconsumes oxygenfromthe water , andinthe worst @-@ case scenariothis leads totheextinction of other species and the loss ofbiodiversity .
The need for coordination
The river serves as a resource for drinkingwater , irrigation , industry , fishing , tourism , power generation , navigationand , unfortunately , alsoas adumpforrawsewage .
This increasing pressure hasleftits footprint : theregionof the Danube and the Black Sea , into which theriver drains after flowing for more than2,850 kilometres , is suffering fromsevereenvironmental and health problems .

It will ensure that projects for pollution reduction and sustainable manage @-@ mentof water resources andecosystemsare implementedinthe wider Black Searegion , " explained Stanko Nick , presidentof the International Commissionfor the Protection of the Danube River ( ICPDR ) .
The Commission wants to make sure thatall EU @-@ fundedprojects inthe regiontakeintoaccountthe priorities set out in the Danube and Black Seaenvironmentalactionplans .
Itis equally vital toensurethatpolicies inotherareas , suchasresearch and agriculture , support the environmental protectionof the region .
The Commission will alsostrive toincreaseinvestments byinternational financialinstitutions suchas the World Bank or European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) , and bilateral donors , such as EU Member States , in the region .
A better future
On the same occasion , the ICPDR and theother major organisationfor water pro @-@ tectioninthe region , the International Commission for the Protectionof the Black Sea , signed an agreement to cooperate oncommonstrategic goals .
Manoela Georgieva , the president of the Black Sea Commission , saidthe time was righttoimprove the state of the sea for good .

Enlargement will have some very positive environmental side effects : cleaner air , good @-@ quality drinking water and safer waste managementacross Europe .
In short , better quality of life for millions of people - a good reason to achieve higher environmental standards .

Knowing thatfor the 13 candidate countries the economic consequences of accession will be significant , an honest answeris : alot .

Many candidate countries are still facingproblems withwater supply bothforhouseholdandindustrial use .

Implementing the EU water directives across the candidatecountries will tackle these problems .
Tenmillionnewhouseholds will have drinking water ontap , andit will be of higherquality , minimising potential healthproblems .
Fewer people will needtobuybottledwater , boosting family budgetsanddiminishing the amountof wasteproduced .
For example , the Bulgarian wheatharvest could grow by 5 % in a few years if EU standards are applied .

Air knows nofrontiers , andreduced pollution from the candidate countries couldalsobring public healthbenefits wortharound 6.5 billion annually to existin g EU Member States .
Russia , Ukraine and Byelorussia can also look forward to cleaner air thanks to their neighbours .
For industry , better water quality meanslower production and maintenance costs , as equipment will nolonger be damagedby dirty water .
Cleandrinking water is vital tohumanlife andis often viewed as a basic humanright .
But many sectors of the economy -

Another advan @-@ tage is that EU directives establish a com @-@ mon set of environmental rules all acrossthe Union .
Like everywhere in Europe , economicdevelopmentandrising consumptioninthecandidatecountries arecreatinggrowing amounts of waste .
Landfill sitesare the mostcommon methodof wastedisposal , and controls are needed to stopthemfromgrowing evenlargerandmore hazardous . Badly managed- orintheworstcaseillegal - landfills canthreatenecosystems andhumanhealthas heavymetals ortoxins leak intotheair and soil .
The first step is toassess what kinds of benefits are available in general ( e.g. reduction in respiratory diseases ) .
The second step is to estimate howlarge these benefits are ( e.g. how many cases will be avoided ) .Finally , the monetary value of the benefits is evaluated ( e.g. howmuch would the damages avoided be worth ) .
The benefits are estimated using several methods , for examplecalculating the " avoided damage " : the reduction in cases of asthma or use of primary materials .
Another method is by analysing " willingness to pay " : the value people place on living in a cleanerenvironment .
Thebenefitstudyestimates that , in Poland , the EU landfill directive will helptoincrease the amountof waste thatisrecycledandcompostedby over 10 mil @-@ liontonnes per year .
This will be a hugeimprovement , given that 98 % of Poland 'smunicipal waste currently goes into land @-@ filling .
In countries like Malta , where landis a scarce resource , smaller waste volumeswill release more space for development .
Boosting business
This is areal incentive to strive for better environmental protection .
Withthe EU environmental directives , candidate countries arealready halfway down the road . ❚
The figures span a very wide range , simply because it is extremely difficult , for example , to measure the impact of air pollution . Inthe same way , it is almost impossible to give a monetary value toa human life .
For these reasons it would not be scientifically honest to mention just one precise figure - the benefits must be seenas general estimates .

Better managementfor coastal zones
Adopted last year , the European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management isdesigned to look after coastal areas in the European Union .
The European Commission istaking steps at EU @-@ level to implement the strategy , but these steps need to be complemented by local , regional and national action inside Member States .
ho is concerned about coastal zones ?
❚ Having a long @-@ term perspective
Implementing the European strategy
❚ Ensuring flexible managementas part of an ongoing process
❚ Working with natural processes
❚ Involving all the stakeholders
Implementation implies the need for actionatlocal andregional levels , designedaccording tolocal andregional condi @-@ tions .
Inthis respect , the EU cancon @-@ tribute best by encouraging andsupport @-@ ing local actors throughthe supply ofinformation , including informationcon @-@ cerning best practice .
❚ Mobilizing the support andinvolvement of all relevantadministrative bodies
Withsuchawiderangeof activities , theresources of our coastal zones are underconstantpressure .
As thephysical andbiologicalresources of the coastal zones degrade , the opportunities for sustainable economic activityarealsoreduced , andsocial conditions decline .
The European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management
Financing for innovative actions relatingtocoastal zones is available th rough the LIFE - Environment Programme , as well asinthe context of INTERREGIII .
In parallel , the EU 's researchframework programme is supporting scientific projectstoprovide the informationneededbycoastal zone planners and managers .
Andthe Directorate @-@ General for the Environment has recently published a study eval @-@ uating the socio @-@ economic benefits of ICZM , andis abouttolaunchamajorproject related to coastal erosion .
Toaddress these problems , the Commis @-@ sionlastyear an n oun ced a European strategy for promoting better management of the coastal zones .
This strategy isbasedaroundaseries of principles for Integrated Coastal Zone Management ( ICZM ) :
❚ Taking a broadapproach ( thematicallyand geographically )
As well as offering this specific informa @-@ tiontocoastal zone managers , the Com @-@ missionhas producedabookletfor thegeneral public explaining the challengesand objectives of Integrated Coastal Zone Management .
This EU focus oncoastalzonesbookletis available inall EU lan @-@ guages , anda video onthe coastal zonesis also planned .
This programme high @-@ lightedthe factthatmany of the prob @-@ lems of coastal zones canbe tracedbacktoinstitutional issues suchas alack ofcoordination between the various authorities and actors responsible for local man @-@ agement .
As another componentof the strategy , the Commissionis working toimprovethe coherence andconsistency of the many EU policies thataffectcoastalzones .
The upcoming revisionof the Bath in g Water Directive , as well as therevision of the Common Fisheries Policy , both offer opportunities for promoting anintegratedapproachtothe coastal zonesof Europe .
Development of nationalstrategies
The Commission ' s dem on stration on ICZM illustrated the importance of stake @-@ holder participationin good coastal zonemanagement .
So , while important , actionby the administrations is notenough .
Neither the Council nor the Commission believes thatsuchalegalframework would be effective .
The entiretext will therefore go for a second readingin Parliament , withthe hope that a com @-@ promise canbe agreed withoutthe needfor a formal conciliation process .
Text by Anne Burrill
All of this action at the EU level , however , needs tobe complementedby actiononthe groundinthe Member States .
These should be based on a stocktak @-@ ing of the mainactors , laws andinstitu @-@ tions thatinfluence the managementoftheir coastal zones .

Preparing ( potential ) candidate countries for tomorrow
I believe that this is an important mutual learning exercise both for existing Member States and the Union 's future members .
Regional Policy and enlargement ,
Regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a gear through pre @-@ accession funding
Enabling candidate countries to develop through the Instrument for Pre @-@ Accession Assistance
As European Enlargement continues apace , assistance given to Candidate Countries is becoming increasingly sophisticated .
In this article we look at how the original pre @-@ accession assistance has taken on new dimensions .
Croatia , like all candidate countries , can use EU assistance for environmental projects .
This broader framework gives candidate countries much more scope to develop their own economies and institutions and therefore the skills of their entrepreneurs and administrators .
Pushing the boundaries further
Pre @-@ accession assistance has previously focused on institutional building and investment in key areas of Community policies .
Investment was implemented through the Instrument for
Not only this , but national authorities are much more closely involved and with a greater degree of responsibility for strategic planning and
( 1 ) e legal basis for this assistance is Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1085 / 2006 , adopted on 17 July 2006 .
More detailed implementing rules are laid down in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 718 / 2007 of 12 June 2007 .
candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU Member States and regions under Cohesion Policy instruments .
A significant share of IPA funds managed by the DGs for Regional Policy and Employment are allocated to Lisbon @-@ type expenditure ( roughly 15 to 20 % of the overall programme allocation , depending on the country ) .
e five components of IPA
Seeing the benefits of IPA
So far , perhaps the most impressive results of IPA were achieved during the preparation of the Operational Programmes .
Components I and II are open to all beneficiary countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey .
Components III , IV and V are open to candidate countries only ( namely the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
Their design mirrors closely the management and programming principles of structural , cohesion and rural development funds .
Thus , IPA allows beneficiary countries to participate at an early stage in managing these Community Cohesion Policy instruments .
By gaining first @-@ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absorb future structural , cohesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
In this relatively short period ( programme preparations and negotiations took less than a year ) , essential preconditions and principles for successful implementation were agreed .
A quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Component III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
Major infrastructure projects are being financed under the Croatian Environmental Operational Programme .
Here new facilities are being financed for solid waste and waste water that fully respect relevant EU environmental standards .
The total project cost is estimated at € 68 million .
New waste water treatment plants and upgrading of sewerage networks are also programmed for the towns of Slavonski Brod , Knin and Drnis .
The total project costs are estimated at € 27 million and € 18 million respectively .
Investment aid in candidate countries is only a fraction of the level of investment assistance available to Member States2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
It gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in devising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of Structural Fund programmes .
The project will serve a population of approximately 444 000 inhabitants
IPA funds are also available to potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans such as Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Regional development : an important step towards EU membership for the Western Balkans
December 2005 marked an important milestone for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on its path to becoming a European Union ( EU ) member - the European Council awarded it the status of " candidate country . "
This heralded the progress made by the country and opened new doors , giving it access to the five components of the instrument for pre @-@ accession assistance .
This has enabled the country to take an active role since 2007 in building its future as a stakeholder in regional policy .
Road construction activities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
As a result of the Regional Development component of pre @-@ accession assistance , a precursor to the Structural and Cohesion Funds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
This strategic planning and sectoral programming has given national authorities the opportunity to take responsibility for social and economic development in cooperation with civil society .
One of the main objectives of the Regional Development operational programme is to contribute to sustainable development and the regional integration of the country into the Western Balkans .
Community aid will be concentrated initially on the transport and environment sectors - regional competitiveness is not expected to be incorporated until 2010 .
e second project involves giving the 75 000 inhabitants of Prilep a reliable sewerage system and a waste water treatment facility .
Its resources in terms of soft water and biodiversity make the country one of the principal natural reservoirs of the region .
Heavy pollution caused by non @-@ treated waste water , as well as non @-@ treated urban and industrial water , is however a real threat for sustainable development and the quality of life for the inhabitants .
Over recent years , the importance of supporting and encouraging crossborder cooperation for Europe 's regions has been recognised more and more widely .
Border regions suff er from a number of specific disadvantages compared to more central regions .
These factors are particularly acute along the European Union 's external borders .
IPA crossborder cooperation programmes with EU Member State participation
MALTA candidate or potential candidate countries on the other .
Secondly , it supports crossborder cooperation between candidate and potential candidate countries themselves .
Finally , the component may also support the involvement of candidate and potential candidate countries in transnational cooperation programmes under the Territorial Cooperation Objective , in particular the south @-@ east Europe and Mediterranean programmes .
Cooperation has long been a key component of EU Cohesion Policy , firstly through the INTERREG Community Initiative , and now via the European Territorial Cooperation Objective .
is article focuses on the first of these elements , which will support up to 12 programmes between the Member States and ( potential ) candidate countries ( see map ) .
Most of these programmes are already up and running , and the first call for projects has already been completed for the Slovenia @-@ Croatia programme
Strictly speaking , the IPA crossborder component supports three types of co @-@ operation .
Firstly , it funds crossborder cooperation between Member States on the one hand and
Regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a gear through pre @-@ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Secretariat staffed from both sides of the border .
Moreover , all projects must have partners from both sides of the border and will be selected jointly by the participating countries , not by the Commission .
On one level therefore , the benefits of these crossborder cooperation programmes seem obvious .
Two European zoos in Hungary and Serbia co @-@ operate to enhance education and environmental protection .
A new , more radical approach to Crossborder Cooperation
However , crossborder cooperation is not , and cannot be , simply about the local level .
By working together in their common border regions , countries can address challenges that transcend political borders .
Flood prevention is one such area , where flooding on one side of the border may have its root causes on the other side .
In addition , some local @-@ level projects may have links to national and European policy issues .
In this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river basins like the Danube and Tisza , could be developed in the IPA crossborder programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , crossborder area .
It is difficult to underplay the radical nature of the crossborder component of the IPA .
Finally , there is another layer of benefits that should also be taken into account - these can be described as the institutional benefits for the ( potential ) candidate countries .
Conclusions e first quarter of 2009 will be a key period for the IPA crossborder programmes .
It will be important to maintain visibility for all the programmes at this crucial stage .
Excluding them from crossborder cooperation would have been a very negative and counterproductive signal to send out .
As a result , all the countries concerned will benefit from being part of programmes implemented under a Structural Funds approach even before they become candidate countries for accession to the Union .
is is the third main innovation of the crossborder component of the IPA .
In line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future Structural Funds implementation , the IPA crossborder programmes will mirror Structural Funds rules as closely as possible. is means firstly that the programmes are run on a multiannual basis .

Building a cleaner future
As Bulgaria reaches towards its future within the EU , funding under the structural policy for pre @-@ accession is helping one town modernise its environmentally contaminating waste disposal and water systems .
Waste water from one of the town 's outflows being discharged into the Danube in Ruse , Bulgaria .
Waste water and wasted water - twin problems
When water does flow from the domestic tap , it will have travelled through approximately 447 km of fracturing , crumbling pipes , 64 % of which are constructed from asbestos cement .
e Danube flows past the Bulgarian town of Ruse , bringing with it trade , visitors and cultural exchange - much as it has done since the Romans first settled here .
When it flows away from Ruse it takes not only barges and cruise ships with it - but also the entire town 's untreated sewerage .
From the vantage point of one of the town 's outflows , discharging around 240 000 litres a second , ' Blue Danube ' seems to be a misnomer .
All this is set to change by the end of 2010 , when the results of Bulgaria 's most extensive water project take effect .
It will deliver : new , more efficient pumps ; 10 replacement hydrophores ensuring constant supply to the town 's high @-@ rise buildings ;
Turning waste into power
Now manager of ViK , five years ago Savov was the head of a technical unit trying to keep the town 's failing sewerage system going : " I remember we had a blockage and I went down into the collector to clear it .
Ammonium will have been oxidised to form nitrate which will then be reduced into elementary nitrogen and the phosphorus precipitated out .
Once air dried and subjected to four phases of anaerobic treatment , the sludge ends up in a digester tank where the resulting methane produced will be collected and stored in a 900 m2 gas holder .
From there it will fuel a biogas power plant and heater offering combined heat and power .
e Integrated Water Project runs from 2005 @-@ 10 , and the funds being invested will turn the waste that is currently degrading the Danube into an alternative power source .
is continual flow of untreated domestic and industrial sewerage will cause the town to fall foul of the EU 's Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment , which comes into force in 2010 .
To address this , one of the key elements of Ruse 's Integrated Water Project will be the complete overhaul of the sewerage system .
Eleven collectors will be rationalised into one central collector which will direct the waste into a state of the art treatment plant , putting an end to a centuries old practice of uncontrolled discharge .
Drinking water - uninterrupted supply of cleaner water
, with a further 100 000m2 set aside for future
Safe disposal - a domestic waste cell being filled. filled .
Further up stream , at the town 's water source , the first pumping station already has a new pump up and running .
Once this is completed , the town will be free of supply problems and the dangers of contamination , " he added .
I feel , for the first time , truly European . "
A new mains transmission pipeline will improve the supply of clean water once installed .
As the water project gets fully underway , another major infrastructure project is being signed off .
With a total capacity of 2 337 000 m ³ and a lifespan of 22 years , the site , 3 km outside Ruse , has three cells for non @-@ hazardous , domestic waste giving a total capacity of 1 819 726 m ³ ( and room for the construction of another two ) .ere are two more for inert waste , typically coming from the construction industry , with a total capacity of 121 955 m ³ .
In fly- tips , this environmentally dangerous liquid seeps straight into the ground , contaminating the land around and getting
into the water supply .
Whereas once Ruse was an industrial town , transport and logistics are currently the town 's main focus : it is building the biggest industrial park in Bulgaria .
Foreign investment is pouring in ; a French hypermarket chain is set to open a branch in the town by the end of next year .
A 5 000 seater sports and entertainment venue , a new five star hotel and trade centre are all under construction , fruits of Bulgaria 's biggest Public Private Partnership project .
Ruse - EU funding buys enough time for the town to put itself back on its feet e new sense of optimism can be seen on the streets .
I thought I 'd have to move to Sofia to get a job and develop personally . "
But , when she came back , she was pleasantly surprised , the town offered far more than she had expected : " Here I am still .
I have work , there is tourism , there are visitors .
I have no intention of moving , I am happy here . "
" Everybody was leaving , " said the town 's mayor , Bojiday Yotov .
" When the democratic changes came about in 1989 , we inherited an economic mess .
If enough bright young professionals of her generation feel the same way , it will not just be Ruse 's future that will flourish. flourish .
Although starting up while Bulgaria was still a candidate for accession , the projects continued as planned , after the country had become a member of the EU .
It was not only the status of the country in its relation to the EU that underwent a change - the funding instrument changed its name , becoming the Instrument for Pre @-@ Accession Assistance ( IPA ) .

Championing economic growth in Croatia
Update on the Croatian Regional Competitiveness Operational Programme 2007 @-@ 09
Many challenges and discoveries lie on the road to EU Accession .
The economic and structural developments that accession economies have to achieve put them all on a steep learning curve , but this process generates economic strengths that stand the test of time .
The Republic of Croatia is a good example of a candidate country facing up to the challenges of accession .
Croatia started the accession negotiations in October 2005 and , providing all pre @-@ accession criteria are met , is hoping to complete the process by the end of 2009 .

Income levels lagged too far below the EU average and growth rates were variable .
Socioeconomic difficulties remain an issue , along with new environmental standards to meet .
For Croatia , it is the third component ( IIIC ) covering regional development and competitiveness which is particularly crucial and projects worth € 35.35 million are scheduled for 2007 @-@ 09 .
Croatia 's natural beauty is a potential source of economic riches .

e legacy of the 1990s investment climate. ese goals will be met more easily and quickly by improving national administrative efficiency at the same time , encouraging cluster development and establishing e @-@ business centres throughout the country .
A further dimension of this priority is focusing on technology transfer and creating the right infrastructure and services to bring new products to the marketplace .
Here public institutions are having to get to grips with entrepreneurial skills and managing intellectual property issues .
BioCenter , which will be located on Zagreb university campus , will also play an important role in bringing the University closer to the market .
Investment Priorities e End Game e first investment priority therefore focuses on building infrastructure in 10 of the least developed counties , combined with human resources investments to strengthen the underlying business environment .
In this last phase of pre @-@ accession , Croatian SMEs are generally still finding it difficult to maintain competitiveness .
Unless this is dealt with now , such weaknesses could repeatedly crop up in the brave new world of the Single European Market .
Forging ahead in Turkey
A new approach to regional competitiveness
Prof. Dr Yavuz CABBAR , Head of Operating Structure at the Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade , explains how the economy is developing through the 2007 @-@ 2010 Operational Programme of the IPA .
Geographically , the Programme concentrates on the regions where income per capita is below 75 % of the Turkish national
NUTS II regions having an income per capita above 75 % of the Turkish average
NUTS II regions having an income per capita below 75 % of the Turkish average
average ( 12 NUTS1 II Regions ) .
Within these regions , there is a strong focus on the 15 Growth Centres which have been identified in the Strategic Coherence Framework .
A map of the Programme area is given below .
Regions supported under the RCOP ree key priorities apply to every programme :
Projects under this priority involve creating a better business environment , to increasing the number of new enterprises , enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the existing enterprises increasing employment opportunities .

Medium
On the next graphic , the Competitiveness Map has been modified to show solely the target regions of the RCOP and three groups of regions with a similar level of competitiveness .
e Right Approach For e Right Region
A vast amount of detailed preparation has gone into drafting the RCOP and its implementation .
It has been difficult , but all the pieces are now in place for some exciting economic developments , as well as providing the tools for evaluating future projects under the IPA .
Where competitiveness is low , projects will concentrate heavily on promoting basic infrastructure , entrepreneurship and start @-@ up , consultancy and financial support , together with interregional and interinstitutional partnership activities .
Tourism projects will be a further tool for boosting businesses .
In regions with medium levels of competitiveness , projects will focus on building institutional structures , business consultancy services , product development and creating partnerships within regions and between them .
Where partnerships between sectors show potential for business growth , these will be encouraged if they are not anticompetitive .
Tourism projects will again be a tool for business development .
In regions with high competitiveness , the measures are targeted at increasing added value , and coping with

Getting ready for IPA - the accreditation process of the management and control systems in Croatia
In 2005 Croatia was informed of the intention of the EU to launch IPA and thus replace the existing pre @-@ accession assistance programmes from 2007 .
Since then , Croatia has been actively preparing for management and implementation of funds within IPA .
Throughout the whole process , intensive and close cooperation was established with the relevant services of the European Commission .
Advisory missions were carried out to provide assistance to the Croatian authorities in building up the necessary institutional , management and control capacities .
• assigning responsibilities at institutional and individual level taking into account the need for adequate segregation of duties ( in particular as regards internal audit and external audit functions ) .
Overall , these challenges have been successfully tackled .
Croatia is no stranger to the euro and soon Zagreb will be managing its own IPA funds .
e conclusion of the verification audit is that the overall system for the management and control of IPA program is compliant with the requirements .
e main challenges that the Croatian authorities had to face in their progress towards accreditation were the following :
• procedures for accreditation and conferral of management of EU funds under decentralised systems are new , • the EU 's strict requirements in relation to designing and implementing sound financial management systems ,

Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - leading the way in crossborder cooperation
Cooperation in the remote mountain regions near the Bulgarian @-@ FYROM border has already been successful .
CBC projects are based on a big vision for building wider European cooperation and integration which will in turn achieve sustainable development in border regions. e main priorities are economic development , social cohesion and improving the quality of life .
By reducing regional imbalances people benefit on both sides of a border and the regions become stronger overall .
e first programme to be approved by the European Commission on 14 December 2007 was between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
Its proactive approach reflects the joint work of the teams in the partnering countries , excellent coordination and the determination to overcome all the challenges along the way .
e programme is partly a logical continuation of existing relations developed through the EU External Border Initiative in 2003 and continued through the Neighbourhood Programme .
A snapshot of the Neighbourhood Programme
A wide variety of projects were successfully implemented under the Neighbourhood Programme .
Here are just a couple of examples among many .
Aside from the formality of the measures , it 's encouraging to think of real people coming together from different organisations and communities with common goals to achieve .
No future without sustainability
An integrated project " No Borders Required " ran between the municipalities of Simitly and Karbintsi .
Joint activities were introduced in the sphere of health protection and improving the quality of life of young people in the crossborder region .
It is a lasting example of integrated work carried out by both local authorities .
Economic gains by themselves would be hollow if they did not also ensure sustainable growth and the preservation and development of natural and cultural resources , which constitute key assets in this border region .
Sustainable projects have a particularly bright future in the tourism sector , where new business opportunities can also offer sound green credentials .
Another project called " The Mountains Are Joining Hands " delivered sustainable benefits through new ways of managing and developing natural , cultural and historic resources .
It ran between the municipalities of Dupnitsa and Kriva Palanka and upgraded the complementary project of RILA and Kochani .
On 13 March 2008 in Kyustendil , Bulgaria the first Joint Monitoring Committee meeting was held .
Fifty @-@ three participants attended the event , ranging from local to national authorities involved in the programme to socioeconomic partners and potential project applicants .
e real start of the programme - the first call for proposals - will be launched during the last quarter of 2008 , when applicants will be able to send their project proposals to the programme secretariat in Kyustendil .
Economic development , social cohesion and improving the quality of life are the main priorities of crossborder cooperation projects .
Communicating Cohesion Policy together - inaugural meeting of the INFORM network
On 17 June 2008 , 120 communication officers from each Member State and several Territorial
Cooperation and networking programmes met for the first time in the context of the INFORM network1 coordinated by the European Commission 's Directorate @-@ General for Regional Policy .
One hundred and twenty communication officers from the 27 Member States met on 17 June 2008 in Brussels of the first meeting of the INFORM network .
Less formally , the network may also be expanded to include all communication officers who are responsible for developing and implementing communication plans and interested in sharing their experiences .
In total , the network is expected to have over 300 participants .
Representatives from other network platforms ( e.g. INTERACT , INTERREG IV C , EPSON , URBACT II ) are also being invited to play an active part .
To facilitate everyday communication between INFORM 's members , an internet forum has been set up2 .
INFORM 's core members will also be invited to attend networking groups addressing specific topics .

How to measure the impact of your actions ?
e aim of this workshop was to share experiences and discuss evaluation issues , e.g. opinion surveys .
European citizens ' perception of Regional Policy , presented by
European citizens ' perception of Regional Policy e meeting 's purpose was for members to get to know each other and discuss current and future actions .
Participants agreed that measuring the impact of EU activities and also the effectiveness of publicity measures via public surveys is one of the most objective methods5. e surveys , accompanied by analysis , also draw lessons for the more efficient promotion of EU structural interventions .
Communicating projects - how to present them attractively to the media and the public
He added that improving communications in the current climate of a disconnection between Europe and its citizens is both a political and legal necessity .
Since Cohesion Policy accounts for nearly one third of EU budget expenditure , it is crucial to highlight its achievements and the value it generates for ordinary Europeans .
e workshop set out to collect ideas and experiences on the most effective and interesting ways of presenting projects in order to generate media attention and public interest .
It began with a presentation by Anna Bugalska ( Ministry for Regional Development , Poland ) of the campain " Poland Growing Beautiful ! e " Seven miracles of EU funds " competition , " which provided the basis for discussion and raised various questions .
Mr Hall highlighted the new requirement to publish a list of project beneficiaries showing the amount of EU and other public funding allocated. is ties in with the ongoing drive to improve transparency in the Union and , critically , to raise the profile of EU @-@ funded projects .
A new tool was also unveiled : a clickable map leading to national or regional websites providing lists of beneficiaries .
Currently most EU countries are marked in grey , which means they have yet to disclose beneficiaries .
Mr Hall stressed that our aim should be to have all countries coloured green on the map by the end of 20084 .
In the afternoon INFORM members had the opportunity to scrutinise and discuss selected aspects of communication during three parallel workshops .
Following the comments received during the day , future meetings will evolve towards a 1.5 / 2day format , providing more time for networking and in @-@ depth discussions among INFORM members .
Greater prominence will be given to Territorial Cooperation programmes .
Production of a communication guide by DG REGIO and INFORM members e next meeting is scheduled for late November .
Although communication officers within programmes are its main target group , project promoters might also find parts of it useful .
Each chapter in the guide will combine a theoretical introduction with a practical selection of existing practices compiled from INFORM members .
Each chapter will also have a leading author , who may then select co @-@ authors .
Its main aim is to promote and support the proper management of the European Territorial Cooperation programmes of 2007 @-@ 13 .
The Inforegio website contains a new section on international affairs , in view of the ever @-@ growing interest in EU Regional Policy outside the European Union .
In 2006 and 2007 the European Commission 's Directorate @-@ General for Regional Policy signed Memoranda of Understanding with Brazil , China and the Russian Federation to set up Structured Dialogues on Regional Policy .
The Structured Dialogues seek to promote mutual understanding , bilateral co @-@ operation , information exchange and best practices regarding the setting up and implementation of Regional Policy .

A number of recent initiatives reflect that quality control in education is an important issue on the political agenda of the European Commission as well as in many European countries .
Within the Lisbon process , enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in Europe is one of the three main goals to be achieved in the period up to 2010 .
In this context , the European Commission has set up an expert group on " Improving the Education of Teachers and Trainers . "
The group has identified the development of systems for the evaluation and accreditation of the initial and inservice education of teachers as one of the priorities involved in improving teacher education .
Concern for quality assurance in teacher education is closely linked to the broader context of the development of higher education and the followup of the Bologna Process .
They should also commit themselves explicitly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assurance , in their work . "
In light of the Lisbon and Bologna processes , the European Commission asked Eurydice in the autumn of 2004 to carry out a study on regulations for the evaluation of teacher education in European countries .
This survey analyses processes for evaluating and accrediting initial and inservice teacher education programmes and institutions .
A review of the main debates and reforms concerning this issue is also included .

This study is concerned with processes for evaluating and accrediting institutions and programmes for initial and inservice teacher education .
The evaluations concerned result in reports or recommendations drawn up for each institution or programme evaluated .
Evaluations of the education system as a whole that lead solely to general reports on the state of that system are not a central aspect of the study .
Only types of evaluation focusing on the quality of provision of teacher education are taken into account .
Financial audits and safety , security or environmental controls are not taken into account .
The education and training of teachers for vocational education is not included .
The reference year for data is 2005 / 06 .
Recent and forthcoming reforms are also considered .
In all cases , the information shown in the Figures relates to official regulations or recommendations .
Methodology and definitions
The questionnaire prepared by the Eurydice European Unit for gathering the necessary information is available on the Eurydice website ( see www.eurydice.org ) .
The questionnaire was devised for gathering similar and readily comparable information from all countries but also included spaces for describing special national characteristics .
The present comparative study carried out with reference to the replies obtained from these questionnaires , has been commented on and checked by the 30 Eurydice Network member countries ( 1 ) .
Some information of specifically national relevance has been included for illustrative purposes .
For the purposes of this study , evaluation and accreditation have been defined as follows :
Evaluation is a general process of systematic and critical analysis leading to judgments and / or recommendations for improvement regarding the quality of a ( teacher ) education institution or programme .
The accreditation procedure presupposes that the programmes or institutions to be accredited are evaluated .
Structure and content
The first four chapters are concerned with the evaluation and / or the accreditation of institutions and programmes for initial teacher education .
More specifically , Chapter 1 provides a general overview of the existence of regulations on external and internal evaluation in the countries covered .
It also indicates whether these regulations are specific to teacher education or generally applicable to all higher education institutions .
Chapters 2 and 3 deal respectively with the main features of external and internal evaluation .
They describe the various players involved , as well as their qualifications , the documents which have to be used in identifying criteria , the focus and procedures of evaluation and its frequency .
Chapter 4 discusses use of the findings from external and internal evaluation .
Chapter 5 considers the evaluation and accreditation of institutions or programmes for inservice teacher education .
It examines whether regulations govern the evaluation or accreditation of the various types of inservice education providers in each country .
It then describes the bodies responsible for this kind of evaluation and accreditation , the procedures applied , their focus , frequency and the use made of their findings .
Finally , the main issues and results of the study are summarised .
A glossary and an annex describing the various types of internal and external evaluation of initial teacher education by country is included at the end of the study
Out of the 30 countries considered in this report , all except Luxembourg have a regulated system for evaluating initial teacher education .
However , the extent to which such evaluation procedures are regulated may differ from one country to the next .
Evaluation may also occur without following any officially binding regulations .
If information is available on current quality assurance practices , it is provided in the appropriate sections of this report .
Normally , initial teacher education for all three educational levels considered here ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) is evaluated , except in three countries .
The German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium provides initial teacher education solely for primary education while , in Cyprus , only institutions training teachers for primary level ( and some teachers of English at secondary level ) are evaluated .
In general , teacher education for secondary level is provided at universities , for which there is currently no regulated system of evaluation .
In contrast , in Austria , regulations on evaluation only exist for universities training teachers for secondary level .
Some countries evaluate their entire system of teacher education .
The purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
It may provide either a basis for reform or an evaluation of newly implemented reforms , as shown in the examples below .
As such procedures do not occur in all countries , these evaluations are not considered in detail in the present analysis .
In Denmark in October 2003 , the Danish Institute of Evaluation ( EVA ) published an evaluation of initial teacher education programmes for compulsory education ( folkeskole ) .
The entire system , including all 18 teacher education colleges , was evaluated based on the internal evaluation reports from all institutions .
The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the programme in general , and no individual recommendations were made .
In Malta , the implementation of the teacher education programmes revised in 1999 is being evaluated in 2005 / 06 .
In Sweden , initial teacher education at all 25 institutions and the teacher education reform from 2001 in particular were evaluated in 2004 , and the results were reported back to the government in spring 2005 .
This was part of the reform and is also a regular part of the evaluation system for all higher education .
In the United Kingdom ( Wales ) , a review of the provision of initial teacher education on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government has been underway since 2005 .
The overall objective is to see how initial teacher education provision could meet demands more appropriately and encourage under @-@ represented groups to teach in future .
In the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , the Inspectorate of Education is also authorised to inspect initial teacher education through a process known as Aspect Review .
This looks at how a certain aspect of initial teacher education is being dealt with across the whole of the system , rather than just within a specific institution .
Following an Aspect Review , comments may be made about individual institutions as well as at system level .
Between 2004 and 2006 in Norway , all general teacher education programmes will be evaluated as part of one large project .
In 24 countries or regions , only general regulations for the evaluation of all higher education apply to the evaluation of teacher education ( Figure 1.1 ) .
Apart from the legislative framework for the evaluation or accreditation of higher education , no specific evaluation systems are geared to teacher education .
In six countries , evaluation of teacher education is governed by both general and specific regulations .
In most cases , specific regulations apply to a particular stage of initial teacher education .
This may be the professional training phase or a particular part of it in the consecutive model , or the induction phase .
In Germany , specific regulations apply solely to the evaluation of the final " on @-@ the @-@ job " qualifying ( induction ) phase , which is organised by the teacher training institutes ( Studienseminare ) .
In Ireland , the provision of final teaching practice is evaluated separately .
In Poland , teacher education provided by universities is evaluated in accordance with general regulations for quality control in higher education , whereas specific regulations apply in the case of teacher training colleges .
In the United Kingdom , there are arrangements for the review of all higher education institutions by the Quality Assurance Agency ( QAA ) .
In England , Wales and Northern Ireland , there are separate arrangements , established by law , for the school inspectorates to evaluate programmes of initial teacher education .
The situation is similar in Scotland .
These specific arrangements cover programmes leading to teacher qualifications .
These arrangements also cover employment @-@ based routes and , in England only , programmes offered by school @-@ centred training consortia .

General regulations apply to the evaluation of all higher education ( including initial teacher education ) .
Specific regulations apply to the evaluation of initial teacher education programmes or institutions .
As will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evaluations are often very closely interrelated ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
In some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out externally .
In several countries , regulations provide for more than one evaluation procedure , including external and / or internal evaluation . There are various reasons for this : different components or stages of education
Chapters 2 and 3 , which deal with external and internal evaluation respectively , take such differences into account where necessary ( for more country @-@ specific details please refer to the Annex ) .
External evaluation is compulsory in most countries and is recommended in Germany , Spain and France .
In Germany , the presidents of universities or colleges of education may recommend an external evaluation if their assessment of internal evaluation results convinces them of the necessity to do so .
In any case , before October 2010 , universities will have to undergo an accreditation process .
External evaluation is optional in Austrian universities , which provide teacher education for academic secondary schools .
The situation is similar in Denmark .
In Italy and Malta , there is no reference to external evaluation in official regulations .
The situation is quite similar in the case of internal evaluation , which is compulsory in the majority of countries and recommended in Spain , France , Cyprus and Slovenia .
In Spain , internal evaluation is regulated by each institution 's selfevaluation plans , as well as by the aims , activities and programmes currently developed and promoted by the ANECA .
In France , internal evaluation is recommended prior to external evaluations for contractual purposes .
Universities in Slovenia strongly advise their member faculties to carry out internal evaluation .
1 ) In Romania , initial teacher education for primary school teachers may also be provided at upper secondary level .
However , the present report is limited to the evaluation of teacher education at tertiary level .

Belgium ( BE de ) : The figure relates solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
Initial teacher training for general secondary education is provided outside the Community .
Most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium .
Denmark : For internal evaluation , the information shown relates to universities only .
Greece : The information relates to the law on quality assurance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
Cyprus : The information relates solely to the external evaluation of colleges providing initial teacher education for primary education .
There is no external evaluation system for the university .
However , in 2001 , the university requested the European University Association to organise an institutional quality review , which was repeated in 2004 .
Austria : The figure only refers to initial teacher education provided by universities .
The future law on the new Pädagogische Hochschulen also foresees external and internal evaluation for teacher education institutions .
However , several of them have carried out internal evaluations in recent years and have also been evaluated externally .
United Kingdom : There is no explicit directive to undertake internal evaluation for higher education institutions .
They are autonomous , and each has its own internal procedures for attaining appropriate standards and assuring the quality of its provision .
All providers of initial teacher education must systematically monitor and evaluate all aspects of provision in order to improve quality .
Evaluation undertaken by bodies or persons not directly involved in the activities of the particular programme or institution concerned is generally referred to as external evaluation .
It is a process whereby data , information , and evidence relating to individual institutions or programmes are collected in order to make a statement about their quality .
Normally carried out by a team of experts , peers or inspectors , this external review aims to reach an independent judgement concerning the quality of education provided within a particular setting .
This chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evaluators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it relies ; the frequency of external evaluation .
Responsible bodies and qualifications required of evaluators
Regulations concerning the bodies responsible for external evaluation exist in all countries where there are formal requirements for external evaluation .
In the majority of them , such evaluation is carried out by an evaluation agency , committee or independent body acting on behalf of the public authorities .
In Belgium ( Flemish Community ) , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia , a committee and an independent body together coordinate the external evaluation procedure , whereas in Germany , this collaboration is optional .
In Cyprus , Poland ( in the case of teacher training colleges ) and Iceland , the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for external evaluation .
In the United Kingdom ( England , Wales and Northern Ireland ) , initial teacher education is evaluated externally by the schools inspectorate .
This is also the case in Ireland in respect of teaching practice .
An education agency performs this task in Sweden and the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) .

Figure 2.2 : Profile of external evaluators of initial teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
Finland : FINHEEC also often uses peer evaluation .
In Latvia , their involvement is compulsory except when first @-@ level professional higher education programmes ( ISCED 5B ) or colleges are evaluated .
In the other countries , foreign participation is recommended .
Only in Belgium ( Flemish Community ) , the Netherlands , Finland , Sweden and Norway is it compulsory or recommended to include students in the team of external evaluators .
In Germany , their involvement is optional .
Several countries specify more precisely the composition of their evaluation committee .
In the Czech Republic , the accreditation commission consists of 21 members appointed by the government upon nomination by the minister for a six @-@ year term .
Membership in the accreditation commission is incompatible with the duties of the rector , vice @-@ rectors and deans .
In Spain , the external evaluation committee has to be well balanced in terms of the training and experience of its members .
In Portugal , people with recognised expertise in the educational , artistic , scientific and entrepreneurial fields are eligible for appointment as external evaluators .
In Finland , the Ministry of Education appoints a committee consisting of 12 members with a good understanding of evaluation , who represent universities , polytechnics , students and employers .
A variety of official documents may be recommended or required as the basis for external evaluation criteria .
In Belgium ( French Community ) , Lithuania , Poland and Romania , all documents listed here are taken into account for drawing up evaluation criteria .
The situation is similar in the Netherlands and Sweden .
In Denmark , Austria and Finland , there are no regulations regarding the documents to be taken into account .
Legislation on higher education and a list of evaluation criteria are the official sources most often used in the context of external evaluation .
The majority of countries also refer to one or several documents which deal specifically with teacher education .
Thirteen countries or regions use a document on qualification standards for prospective teachers for the purpose of external evaluation .
Several countries make use of other specific documents relating to teacher education .
These may be regulations or guidelines .
The " Guidelines for Initial Teacher Education Courses " in Scotland give regulations on the requirements for initial teacher education and specify such things as the length of programmes , the amount of school experience and compulsory programme elements .
The " Standard for Initial Teacher Education : Benchmark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have attained at the end of their programmes .
The Evaluation Framework for the Accreditation of Programmes of Initial Teacher Education and the Arrangements for the Accreditation of Programmes of Initial Teacher Education give detailed guidance on how the accreditation process works .
The Czech Republic , Greece , Spain , Ireland , Cyprus , Hungary , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia , Iceland and Norway do not stipulate the use of documents devoted specifically to initial teacher education for external evaluation .
However , these countries have all adopted lists of criteria , some of which may involve aspects directly relating to teacher education .
Some countries report the existence of " guides " or " questionnaires " for external evaluation .
In Latvia , for example , the Higher Education Quality Evaluation Centre has developed a questionnaire for evaluation experts , which consists of questions regarding the main quality aspects to be evaluated .
Although it may not be defined as a statutory list , it is normally used by experts to facilitate the evaluation process and to prepare reports on the institutions evaluated .

United Kingdom : The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
Explanatory note For the definition of evaluation criteria and qualification standards , please refer to the glossary .
The scope of external evaluation may encompass a wide variety of issues .
It may be concerned with the results of internal evaluation , the content of the curriculum for teacher education , teaching methods ( i.e. how the content of that curriculum is taught ) , or assessment practices .
Many countries focus their external evaluation on all or almost all of these issues .
Only Ireland refers to relatively few of them .
The regulations of almost all countries state that external evaluation has to take account of internal evaluation procedures or recommend that it should do so .
In Denmark , Austria , Finland and Sweden , there are no regulations concerning the scope of external evaluation .
This does not imply that the issues mentioned in Figure 2.4 are not usually covered .
In these countries , the external evaluator or the institutions requesting an evaluation decide about its scope .
FINHEEC can also make an agreement with the ministry of education on evaluation assignments .
Moreover , institutions and student unions can propose suitable evaluation topics to FINHEEC .
Virtually all countries with regulations evaluate the content of teacher education .
Either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
Additional criteria are mentioned by a few countries .
External evaluation in the United Kingdom ( England ) examines whether training meets the needs of individual trainees and how applicants for training are selected .

For the definition of internal evaluation , general teacher education and professional teacher training , please refer to the glossary .
External evaluation may be conducted in different ways .
It is normally based on a site visit and on an internal evaluation report .
Such a visit may include interviews or surveys with the management , academic and administrative staff as well as with students .
Observations directly linked to student teachers being taught may also be included .
In Finland , the higher education institutions under review compile selfevaluation reports for the external evaluation team .
This team visits the higher education institutions involved and writes a review report .
Besides this basic method , FINHEEC also uses other evaluation methods such as portfolios , peer evaluation and benchmarking .
Site visits are compulsory or recommended for external evaluation everywhere , except in Slovenia and Slovakia , where they are optional .
In Slovenia , external evaluation is based on the documentation submitted by higher education institutions applying for evaluation .
In the majority of countries , site visits include interviews with the management and with academic and administrative staff .
Regulations also provide frequently for interviews with students .
In many countries , regulations of the evaluation process provide for interviews with all three categories of participants .
In Latvia and the Netherlands , interviews with students are compulsory , whereas interviews with the management and staff are optional .
As a general rule , a particular person may not attend more than one meeting .
The committee will ensure that its interviews with different groups focus on those aspects previously analysed which have yielded contradictory findings , or which seem especially important , are unclear or are not sufficiently conclusive .
Classroom observation ( in the institution providing initial teacher education ) cannot be regarded as among the main procedures in external evaluation .
Yet while there is no reference to it in the regulations of most countries , it is nevertheless compulsory in nine of them .
In the United Kingdom ( England ) , interviews with staff in partnership schools are included in the procedures .
The results of internal evaluation are taken into consideration in almost all places where regulations exist .
Elsewhere , external evaluators make use of internal evaluation reports that are not produced specifically for purposes of external evaluation .

Belgium ( BE de ) : The information relates solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
Poland : ( 1 ) relates to external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
Procedures not mentioned in official documents are , however , usually included in the evaluation process .
United Kingdom : The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
Explanatory note For the definition of site visit , please refer to the glossary .
In most European countries , external evaluation of institutions and programmes providing initial teacher education takes place at fixed intervals which are determined at central or higher level .
In some countries , there are several types of external evaluation with different fixed intervals .
In ten countries or regions , the intervals specified correspond to maximum periods , which means that external evaluation may occur more often .
The highest frequency relating specifically to the evaluation of initial teacher education is noted in Ireland ( evaluation of teaching practice ) and the United Kingdom ( England ) .
Each year in Ireland , 10 % of students in their final year of teacher education for primary schools are selected for assessment during their teaching practice .
The institutions in which they enrolled receive an evaluation report .
Regular evaluations for the renewal of accreditation are then generally planned within a period ranging from three to twelve years after the preceding evaluation .
In Latvia , the external evaluation enabling new institutions to be accredited for the first time is normally not repeated .
In Slovenia , prior to the new law on higher education issued in 2004 , a similar situation was in force concerning teacher education programmes .
On the contrary , in Latvia , the reaccreditation of teaching programmes is mandatory .
In Sweden , regular evaluation linked to the ( re- ) accreditation of higher education institutions is carried out , but no procedure is planned for new programmes or institutions .
Evaluations conducted at variable intervals according to the institution or programme

Additional notes Belgium ( BE de ) : The information relates solely to evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
For general secondary education , teacher education is provided outside the Community .
For the latter , the distinct intervals shown depend on the length of teacher training .
Accreditation is awarded for at most twice the standard length of study programmes .
Denmark : The Center for Videregående Uddannelse are given the possibility to participate in a single accreditation process allowing them to obtain the quality label of University Colleges .
Germany : Only evaluations of bachelor 's- and master 's @-@ type programmes are used for the purpose of accreditation ( or re @-@ accreditation ) .
France : ( 1 ) relates to evaluation carried out by the DES ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation carried out by the CNE and the IGAENR .
Once an institution has been accredited , a second evaluation occurs after four years .
Then , evaluation occurs after a further ten years .
A draft law has been tabled with a view to performing external evaluations every four years .
Latvia : ( 1 ) relates to external evaluation of programmes ; and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of institutions .
Austria : The figure only refers to initial teacher education provided by universities .
Slovenia : The new ( 2004 ) law on higher education has established the principle of compulsory reaccreditation every seven years , with effect from 2005 .
This will be applied to institutions for teacher education once they have designed their study programmes according to the Bologna requirements .
Slovakia : ( 1 ) relates to external evaluation of programmes ; and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of institutions .
Sweden : An interval of six years between external evaluations is normally the rule for higher education institutions .
However , an extra evaluation of teacher education programmes will occur in 2006 , two years after the previous evaluation .
This is an exceptional situation linked to the monitoring of the 2001 reform of programmes for initial teacher education ( see chapter 1 ) .
United Kingdom ( ENG / WLS / NIR ) : The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
In England , programmes for teacher education are to be evaluated at least twice in the six @-@ year period from 2005 to 2011 .
In Wales , the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspections by 2008 , after which a different cycle will be introduced . United Kingdom ( SCT ) : ( 1 ) relates to evaluation of all higher education institutions ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education .
In ten countries or regions , the interval between external evaluations varies according to the programme or institution .
In France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occurs at regular intervals and another whose frequency varies .
In the Czech Republic , the interval between evaluations of study programmes is fixed by regulations , which is not the case for institutions .
Several scenarios are possible in cases where the frequency of external evaluation varies according to the programme or institution .
In the Czech Republic , where evaluation is concerned with similar types of programme , the education faculties were last evaluated in 1997 / 98 .
In Iceland , external evaluations relating to programmes or institutions for teacher education occurred in 1998 and 2005 .
In Germany , Spain , Austria and Finland , higher education institutions are also involved in the decision to proceed with external evaluation .
In Denmark , it can take place upon the request of various bodies .
In Denmark , programme evaluation may be conducted by EVA ( Danish Evaluation Institute ) on its own initiative and upon the request of , for example , the government , ministries , advisory boards , local authorities and establishments .
In Germany , external evaluation is carried out on the initiative of universities and teacher training centres , or the ministry of education in the case of teacher training institutes ( Studienseminare ) ( see Chapter 4 , Section 4.1 ) .
For bachelor 's- or master 's @-@ type programmes , there is a procedure for accreditation and reaccreditation .
The legislation of the different Länder states that all external evaluation should be carried out regularly without specifying its frequency .
In Spain , the ANECA issues a call for applications , annually or every two years , from higher education institutions wishing to be evaluated .
The decision whether to submit to evaluation is taken by the head of the institution .
However , all institutions will have to be evaluated at least once by 2010 .
In Austria , external evaluation may be conducted at the request of the universities or the Ministry for Education , Science and Culture .
CHAPTER 3 INTERNAL EVALUATION OF INITIAL TEACHER EDUCATION
Internal evaluation ( self @-@ evaluation ) of teacher education may BE defined as an evaluation process for which those working in a particular institution or programme are responsible .
The process may consist of the systematic collection of data and the questioning of students , lecturers and other staff , and generally results in a final report .
Internal evaluation offers opportunities for quality enhancement in so far as it is a collective appraisal of structures and practices existing within the institution concerned .
As already indicated in Chapter 1 , regulations on internal evaluation exist in all countries and regions , except in Luxembourg .
In almost all countries , internal evaluation is compulsory .
It is recommended in Spain , France , Cyprus and Slovenia and is optional in Malta .
An overview of the different kinds of internal evaluation in each country covered by this survey is provided in the annex .
More than one type of internal evaluation exists in the Czech Republic , Germany , Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Portugal , the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) and Iceland .
In most countries , coordination is the responsibility of the management .
Where this is not the case , an evaluation committee usually takes over this responsibility .
In Portugal , the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) and Bulgaria , all or almost all of the four bodies mentioned above take part in the coordination of internal evaluation .
In the Czech Republic , Germany ( in the case of teacher training institutes ) , Poland , Slovenia and Iceland ( for the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions ) , the responsibility for coordination lies mainly with the management of the institution .
In teacher training institutes ( Studienseminare ) in Germany , the main body responsible for coordinating internal evaluation is the management .
However , in some Länder , it may also include administrators from the office of teacher training ( Amt für Lehrerbildung ) or similar institutions in the Länder , and staff from the teacher training institutes to be evaluated .
In universities in Poland , the teacher education faculty or chair of the university is responsible for internal evaluation .
The faculty council usually elects a committee , which has to carry out evaluation and prepare a written report .
In teacher training colleges , internal evaluation is carried out by the college council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
In Slovenia , university rectors and deans are responsible for internal evaluation , according to the 2004 Higher Education Act .
The internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the internal evaluation process has to be managed by a specific commission appointed by the rector / dean .
In the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions in Iceland , institutions are free to decide how to organise their quality assurance work .
However , the rector bears the main responsibility .
In some institutions , there is a special quality manager , while in others quality issues are the responsibility of the governing board or a council .
In Denmark , the governing board is the sole body responsible for coordinating internal evaluation .
In Bulgaria , the evaluation committee presents its reports to the governing board of the institution .
The reports are then officially approved by the council of academic staff representatives which finally issues recommendations to the management .

These experts may either act on behalf of the principal or board of the institution , or simply give methodological / technical support to the staff responsible for conducting the evaluation .
In Italy , neither the management nor the academic staff takes part in evaluation .
In the Netherlands , the participation of the management is optional .
In nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in Figure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
The members of this committee may come from a wide range of backgrounds .
In Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the faculties or departments concerned .
It is strongly recommended that students should be included in its membership .
In Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should consist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
It is recommended that committees should have a maximum of seven members .
In Hungary , the committee members are professors and researchers elected by the council of the institution for a period of three years .
The student self @-@ governing body may delegate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
In Iceland , the committee should comprise at least four and no more than six members drawn from faculty staff , students and administration .

Belgium ( BE de ) : The Figure relates solely to the internal evaluation of initial teacher education institutions for primary education .
For general secondary education , teacher education is provided outside the Community .
Most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium .

Poland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation of teacher training colleges .
United Kingdom ( ENG / WLS / NIR ) : The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
Evaluations would normally also involve schools in partnership with higher education institutions .
United Kingdom ( SCT ) : ( 1 ) relates to annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that takes place every four years .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
Several countries state that other participants may contribute to internal evaluation , including the institution 's non @-@ academic staff , external stakeholders from the business sector or academic life elsewhere , and former graduates of the institution .
In the French Community of Belgium , those who graduated from the institution in the three years prior to internal evaluation may participate .
In the Flemish Community of Belgium , the administrative and technical staff of the institution participate on a compulsory basis .
In Greece , the participation of the scientific and administrative staff is optional .
In Italy , the evaluation committee consists of academic and non @-@ academic experts chosen by the rector .
The majority of its members are usually academics , some of them from other universities .
In Spain and Portugal , administrative and service staff may participate in internal evaluation .
In the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , it is compulsory for people external to the faculty or school offering the programme and for people from outside the institution to take part in the annual evaluation .
In Romania , it is recommended that representatives of the institution 's best graduates and of employers should take part in the internal evaluation of pedagogical university colleges and universities .
In several countries , although no official regulations exist , there may be practices defining who usually participates in internal evaluation .
In Malta , for example , all academic staff members are encouraged to conduct an evaluation of their course programme by means of questionnaires or interviews with their students .
The respective departmental heads may also carry out their own independent evaluations .
External experts from abroad serving as moderators are invited to review both the course content and assessed assignments . They may also put forward recommendations for possible improvements .
Although it is not officially regulated , management , academic staff and students are usually involved in internal evaluation in Austrian universities .
In Slovenia , the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the specific commission appointed by the dean for managing the internal evaluation process should be composed of teachers , administrators and student representatives .
Virtually all of the foregoing types of document are used to identify the criteria for internal evaluation in the French Community of Belgium , Greece , Lithuania and Poland .
Almost all countries use legislation on higher education to establish the criteria of internal evaluation , always in conjunction with several of the other documents referred to above .
In almost all cases , the use of such documents is compulsory , except in the French Community of Belgium and Romania , where their use is recommended .
Several countries publish special documents , including a list of criteria for internal evaluation , to support higher education institutions in their task .
In Spain , the ANECA publishes two main methodological resources to support universities in carrying out their institutional evaluation programme .
The second , the Guía de Autoevaluación ( self @-@ evaluation guide ) , is intended to facilitate the start of the selfevaluation phase .
However , like all other higher education institutions , IUFMs will be increasingly expected in the first instance to carry out selfevaluation using the Livre des Références .
In Hungary , the Accreditation Committee provides guidelines for higher education institutions to prepare their annual institutional evaluation report and detailed guidance concerning the documents relating to self @-@ evaluation .
Half of all countries also refer to the list of criteria used for external evaluation .
In Slovakia , the list of criteria developed by the Accreditation Committee for purposes of external evaluation and accreditation is very often used for the internal evaluation of study programmes in general .
While the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is optional in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , internally devised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them .
Figure 3.3 : Official documents to be used to establish criteria for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
No regulations or no reference included in them
However , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification frameworks for programmes that provide it . These include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
In the United Kingdom , although there are no specific regulations to this effect , the use of external evaluation results for internal evaluation is expected .
It is therefore taken for granted that inspection outcomes will be fed into self @-@ evaluation .
In the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , the outcomes of the General Teaching Council for Scotland process will in turn feed back into the internal quality assurance processes of the university .
However , there is no explicit mention of this having to happen - simply an expectation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
In Malta , however , regulations and content guidelines on initial teacher education as well as qualification standards for prospective teachers are usually used for this purpose .
Of the countries with official regulations on the scope of internal evaluation , most cover all ( or almost all ) of the above @-@ mentioned issues .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curriculum is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
Some countries consider specific criteria other than those mentioned in Figure 3.4 , such as organisational issues or student @-@ focused social issues during internal evaluation .
In Greece , student welfare and the administrative services of the institution are also evaluated .
In Spain , both practices are encountered .
The lack of regulations on the scope of internal evaluation in some countries does not imply that the issues actually covered differ greatly from the ones listed in Figure 3.4 .
In Denmark , the university governing board determines the focus of internal evaluation .
The questionnaire typically covers teaching methods , human resources management , student achievements and students " opinions on the education received and the balance between professional training and general education .
In Malta , almost all issues mentioned in the Figure are covered during the internal evaluation process .
There was also a focus on additional parameters , such as curriculum development and international cooperation .
As well as the quality of teaching , other areas of interest were the organisational structure , administration , tasks of the department , research , the provision of services , public relations and the development plan .
In Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropriateness of the course workload and the teachers ' and assistants " ability to deliver the course .
The global reports established on this basis by the department and the faculty are used for gauging how students ' perceptions vary over time or across disciplines , and for comparing student performance .
Issues such as the relevance of student gender and the appropriateness of the teaching methodology used are also addressed .

Latvia : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of a higher education institution for its accreditation , ( 2 ) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for accreditation , and ( 3 ) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for reaccreditation .
Although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school placements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the selfevaluation report .
Slovenia : University rectors and deans must assume responsibility for quality .
Some of the issues shown in the table are therefore normally the focus of internal evaluation .
The information provided relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
United Kingdom ( SCT ) : The annual internal review process and matters to be considered externally are liable to cover similar ground .
Iceland : ( 1 ) relates to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place before external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
A variety of procedures or mechanisms may be used for internal evaluation .
For example , interviews or surveys may focus on the management of an institution or on its academic and administrative staff or students .
Classroom observation of student teachers being taught may be another way of collecting the information required for internal evaluation .
In most countries , all three types of interview mentioned above are used on a compulsory basis or are recommended .
In Belgium , Germany , Estonia , Spain and Bulgaria , they are used together with classroom observation .
Student interviews or surveys are the most widely used means of carrying out internal evaluation .
In Italy , Latvia ( in the ( re- ) accreditation of study programmes ) and Slovakia , they are the only compulsory procedure .
In Poland ( in the case of teacher training colleges ) and Romania , interviews or surveys of students are not foreseen .
Where internal evaluation refers to the ( re- ) accreditation of a study programme in Latvia , employers of former graduates are interviewed as well as students .
In Slovakia , students are obliged to complete questionnaires annually , focusing mainly on their satisfaction with teaching and learning .
In 13 countries and regions , there are no official regulations which lay down procedures and mechanisms for internal evaluation .
However , certain practices may exist .
In Denmark , internal evaluation is very often carried out as a written evaluation .
In Malta , all academic staff must develop a work forecast for every academic year , which is then discussed with the departmental head .
Each teacher 's performance is also appraised through a formal discussion .
In Slovenia , according to the internal rules of higher education institutions , student opinion surveys are used for the internal evaluation process .
In the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) , internal evaluation is expected but is not explicitly required .
Its format is not prescribed .
However , the inspectorate ( Ofsted ) cannot insist that a selfevaluation should be completed .

Frequency
In 13 countries , internal evaluation should occur on an annual basis .
In Bulgaria , it has to be carried out several times a year .
In ten countries or regions , higher education institutions have to undertake internal evaluation at fixed intervals of longer periods ranging from three to ten years .
In most of these countries , the timing depends on that of external evaluation .
This may mean that both types of evaluation must take place during the same academic year and amount to a single process .
Alternatively , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evaluations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . In Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
In Ireland , internal evaluation , which has to be carried out every ten years , results in external evaluation of the quality assurance procedures adopted by higher education institutions .
In Austria , both situations ( external evaluation calling for internal evaluation and vice versa ) may exist .
In Hungary , intermediate reports are additionally required every four years .
In all countries with procedures for accrediting programmes or institutions ( see Figure 4.1 ) , initial accreditation generally involves an internal evaluation .
In the nine countries or regions in which the frequency of internal evaluation is not determined by regulations , different scenarios are possible .
In the French Community of Belgium , France and Iceland , the body responsible for external evaluation decides when it should occur .
In Spain and Finland , higher education institutions are also involved in the decision to proceed with external evaluation ( see Chapter 2 , Section 2.5 ) .
In Finland , the institutions must also conduct an internal evaluation independent of external evaluation , and determine its frequency .

CHAPTER 4 USE MADE OF EVALUATION FINDINGS
The results of evaluation may be used in different ways , with direct or indirect repercussions for institutions or programmes .
Inadequate quality may , for example , mean that institutions have to draw up and implement a plan for improvement consisting of various measures , which may be subject to followup evaluation .
Penalties are also possible , as when an institution is no longer granted the right to award qualifications , or when its funding is adjusted .
Conversely , high @-@ standard performance may lead to an increase in funding .
Over and above their consequences for institutions , the results of evaluation may also be made available to their staff , students and the general public .
Finally , evaluation findings from all institutions may be collated and summarised in national reports concerned with the quality of initial teacher education as a whole .
The following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the availability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
In just five countries or regions ( the French Community of Belgium , Denmark , Ireland , Austria and Finland ) , these aspects derive only marginally from regulations - if at all .
In the French Community of Belgium , the purpose of external evaluation is essentially to point the way forward for individual institutions .
It is intended that they should - entirely on their own initiative - introduce a procedure for reform inspired by the findings of external evaluation ( which remain confidential ) .
However , in the end it is the government of the Community which decides on the possible consequences of external evaluation .
In Ireland and Finland , the use made of the external evaluation results is the responsibility of the institution evaluated .
In Finland , the external evaluation body ( FINHEEC ) usually undertakes a followup evaluation after three years .
Figure 4.1 : Possible consequences of external and internal evaluation for institutions / programmes providing initial teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
Consequences of external evaluation : Impact on ( re- ) accreditation Impact on funding
Chapter 4 - Use made of Evaluation Findings
In the majority of countries , the findings of external evaluation provide the basis for a decision regarding the ( re- ) accreditation of institutions or programmes .
This means determining whether or not an institution may be officially recognised as satisfying the conditions required by accreditation standards .
The evaluation results are therefore used to take a major decision regarding institutions and their entitlement to provide teacher education and award the corresponding qualifications , and to obtain public funding .
Theoretically , if the results are poor , a programme may be discontinued or an institution closed .
In Lithuania , evaluations conducted by the centre for quality assessment in higher education are geared as a priority to enhancing quality , but their results also feed into a ( re- ) accreditation process .
In the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) , one of the purposes of inspection is to check compliance with requirements .
In Norway , the agency for quality assurance in education evaluates all higher education institutions on a regular basis .
If the results are not satisfactory , the institution concerned may continue to offer its existing programmes but may not introduce any new ones until it has improved its performance .
The findings of external evaluation may also provide a basis for initiating a possible reaccreditation procedure .
To date , programmes for teacher education have not been the subject of such a procedure .
When a programme is concerned , funding is generally reorganised within the institution concerned , and its amount may remain stable .
However , in Spain and Sweden , the accreditation procedure cannot affect funding in any way .
The level of funding may also vary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) .
In the event of unfavourable evaluation in the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium , the institution concerned may have to repay the public funding awarded to it for operational purposes .
The teacher education institutions in France ( Instituts universitaires de formations des maîtres - IUFMs ) are evaluated by various bodies ( see the annex ) .
The results of these evaluations are taken into account notably during negotiations to renew the four @-@ year public funding contract .
In Portugal , positive findings may be an incentive to introduce new programmes or develop already existing ones .
Conversely , in the case of poor results , programmes may be suspended .
However , in practice , such situations have not yet been encountered .
This generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time , which varies from one country to the next .
In Germany and France , the followup is optional .
In Greece and Iceland , the sole consequence of external evaluation for institutions is the implementation of a plan for improvement .
In most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re- ) accreditation decisions , conditional or temporary accreditation may be awarded in the case of non @-@ compliance with accreditation requirements .
This conditional accreditation is usually delivered for two or three years , and a followup is organised in the meantime .
In the Czech Republic , if the accreditation awarded to study programmes is subject to certain conditions , the faculty has to submit ( generally within two years ) a report on the fulfilment of imposed conditions .
In Latvia , a study programme may receive temporary accreditation ( for two years ) only once .
As regards internal evaluation , regulations allow for the formulation of a plan for improvement in most countries .
A plan of this kind is recommended in the French Community of Belgium , Germany , Estonia , Slovakia and Romania , and is optional in Italy .
In around ten countries , institutions practise internal evaluation for which no regulations concerning a plan for improvement are issued .
This is due to the autonomy of institutions .
In France , Cyprus , Slovenia and Iceland , this internal evaluation is recommended and / or only sparingly regulated .
In Germany , external evaluation is not compulsory .
Regulations on the publication of individual external evaluation results for each institution or programme are very common .
In 19 countries , these results are published systematically .
However , systematic publication of internal evaluation results is only required in six countries ( the Czech Republic for annual internal evaluation , Italy , Lithuania , Slovakia , Finland and Sweden ) .
In Spain and Latvia , the publication of the results of external and internal evaluations is optional .
In Spain , the institution evaluated decides whether the results are to be published .
In Slovenia and the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) , the findings of external evaluation are not published as such , but they are available to the public indirectly .
In Slovenia , working meetings of the body responsible for external evaluation , the Council for Higher Education , are public .
Information is circulated via the press .
In Norway , publication of the findings of internal evaluation is recommended , whereas in Germany , Greece , Hungary and the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) it is optional .
In the majority of countries , there are no regulations or recommendations on the publication of internal evaluation results .
However , it may nevertheless be common to publish these results .
In Ireland , internal and external evaluation reports are published on university websites .
This may also be the case in Spain .
In Germany , Hungary , the Netherlands , Iceland , Norway and Romania , the results of external evaluation are also published in brochures on education , congresses , press articles , etc .
The publication of evaluation findings means that they are available de facto to all those involved in the functioning of higher education .
In the French Community of Belgium and Poland ( teacher training colleges ) , there are very few regulations on the publication of results and their accessibility within the institutions .
Only management has systematic access to results .
In Austria , the publication of external and internal evaluation results is not subject to any regulations , which may be due to a lack of regulations on evaluation in general .
In practice in this country , evaluation results are usually made available to the stakeholders .

Chapter 4 - Use made of Evaluation Findings
For general secondary education , teacher education is provided outside the Community .
Most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium .
Czech Republic : ( 1 ) relates to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occurs prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) relates to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
Luxembourg : For secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
According to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : Internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) relates to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training colleges .
Slovenia : According to internal institutional rules , internal evaluation results are published on the website of the faculty concerned .
They are also published in reports produced by the national higher education quality assessment commission .
United Kingdom : The information relates solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
Schools working in partnership with the institutions evaluated may access the findings of external evaluation in the majority of countries .
In 11 countries , the results have to be available to academic staff and students .
In Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
Monitoring of the education system pursues several aims .
It is intended to help control the system , provide reports on its quality and enable adjustments to enhance its performance .
It implies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .
However , the preparation of national reports and indicators based on the evaluation reports of individual institutions is far from general practice .
Quality Assurancein Teacher Educationin Europe
In Sweden , teacher education is dealt with specifically in national reports on higher education .
In addition , the inspectorates publish ad @-@ hoc reports on specific aspects of teacher education .
Figure 4.3 : National reports and indicators prepared with reference to findings from internal and external evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
Preparation of a national report on higher education
For general secondary education , teacher education is provided outside the Community . Most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium .
Germany : Only the results of external evaluations to ( re- ) accredit bachelor 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 Länder ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
CHAPTER 5 ACCREDITATION AND EVALUATION OF IN @-@ SERVICE TEACHER EDUCATION
Professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nationally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
In several countries , the design of inservice education programmes has become completely decentralised and is the responsibility of schools .
As a consequence , schools and local education authorities offer training based on the skills and development needs of teachers and schools .
In the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illustrated in the examples below .
In Greece and Cyprus , public authority inservice teacher education centres are the only bodies offering provision .
In Norway , higher education institutions are the sole providers of inservice teacher education .
Figure 5.1 : Types of provider and regulations for the accreditation and / or evaluation of inservice teacher education for general education ( ISCED 1 @-@ 3 ) , 2005 / 06

Belgium ( BE fr ) : The information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
These two projects are currently being implemented .
Lithuania : Draft regulations on the evaluation of inservice teacher education are in the final phase of legal approval .
Their approval and a first evaluation are planned for 2006 . Iceland : Evaluation of higher education institutions providing inservice teacher education has not yet been carried out .
Chapter 5 - Accreditation and Evaluation of In @-@ Service Teacher Education
This means that inservice teacher education undergoes the same quality assessment as higher education .
In these two countries , regulations on both accreditation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
The situation is similar in Italy , where regulations on accreditation do not apply to higher education institutions or to institutions for initial teacher education .
The contents of the course have to be relevant to the objectives and strategies of the institutions and the initial education of the participants .
Although no regulations exist in Cyprus , evaluation of inservice education programmes is conducted by the Pedagogical Institute of the Ministry of Education and Culture .
In Malta , organisers are encouraged to review their courses by asking participants to fill in questionnaires .
In Austria , the Pädagogischen Institute ( institutions for inservice teacher education ) publish an annual report on their provision .
Furthermore , in England , the Training and Development Agency for Schools has an extended remit covering inservice education for teachers .
In Spain , depending on the legislation of the Autonomous Community concerned , the evaluation of inservice teacher education providers consists of different elements .
Those referred to as " compulsory " in Figure 5.2 are common to all Autonomous Communities , whereas those termed " optional " reflect the situation of just some of them .

Initial teacher education abroad
Belgium ( BE fr ) : The information relates solely to the Institut de la formation en cours de carrière ( in @-@ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of inservice education at joint level of all public and private providers ( interréseaux ) .
Ireland : Data refer to both the external evaluation of a sample of inservice teacher education courses and the periodic evaluation of inservice teacher education providers .
Italy : ( 1 ) refers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education , and ( 2 ) to teacher unions or associations and private @-@ sector training providers .
Lithuania : The draft regulations include almost all procedures on a compulsory basis . Slovenia : Data refer to accreditation only .
Concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
Almost all countries with official regulations , except Denmark , Sweden , Iceland and Norway , analyse a written plan .
It is recommended in the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium and Slovakia and is optional in Slovenia .
Responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e.g. an audit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspectorate specifically established for school education or inservice teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
In line with the decentralised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accreditation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Autonomous Community to the next .
Given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of inservice teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 Länder .
As regards evaluation and accreditation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many Länder have established or appointed central institutes or agencies for this task .
As an independent body , the Accreditation Council ( Akkreditierungsrat ) also takes part in accreditation and evaluation .

Lithuania : Draft regulations include an agency for evaluation within the ministry of education .
Finland : Inservice teacher education of at least 30 ECTS provided by higher education institutions may be accredited by the FINHEEC at the request of the provider .
Iceland : Evaluation of higher education institutions providing inservice teacher education has not yet been carried out .
In Hungary , the process occurs at three levels . At preparatory level , the organiser of the programme asks an expert from the National Register of Experts to give an opinion on it .
In a second stage , an expert from the Pedagógus @-@ továbbképzési Akkreditációs Testület ( In @-@ service Teacher Training Accrediting Body ) evaluates the programme in accordance with a guideline based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme .
In Poland , depending on the course evaluated , two different bodies carry out evaluation .
The ministry of education evaluates and accredits inservice teacher education courses offered by the National Centre of In @-@ Service Teacher Training .
It also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practising teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during afternoons , weekends or summer .
The heads of regional education authorities ( kuratoria ) , which are subordinate to the ministry , evaluate and accredit qualification courses offered by all other providers .
In Denmark , either the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Science , Technology and Innovation carry out accreditation .
They are supported by a team of statisticians specially engaged by the Pedagogical Institute for this purpose .
In the German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium and Ireland , the inspectorate is part of the ministry of education .
An inspectorate for inservice teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @-@ Service Teacher Training ) , where it participates in evaluation along with other bodies .
In the French Community of Belgium , the Institut de la formation en cours de carriere , a community @-@ wide institution , organises and evaluates inservice teacher education , notably through its operators .
In Latvia , an expert evaluates the programme in question on behalf of the approval commission for further teacher education programmes .
In Luxembourg , there are no regulations applicable to the bodies that accredit or evaluate inservice teacher education .
In almost half of the countries considered , there are no regulations on the scope of accreditation and / or evaluation .
However , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in Figure 5.4 are not usually covered .

Explanatory note Financial audits and administrative controls are not taken into consideration .
In many countries where regulations exist , all or almost all issues mentioned are covered .
In the majority of them , the content of the activity as well as the teaching methods and / or the competences of the trainers are taken into account .
Infrastructure ( such as teaching material , technical equipment ) is also quite often evaluated . Participants " opinions on the training they receive are considered in eight countries .
The German @-@ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accreditation of inservice teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
These regulations take all aspects mentioned into account .
Several countries mention a variety of other aspects .
Consistency between content and organisation of the activity and the educational aims seems to be one of the most important aspects .
In Ireland , evaluation also focuses on the relevance of the course to the primary school curriculum and the extent to which the activity complies with official policy and guidelines .
The detailed content requirements are compared with the goals of the respective training programme and with the data given by the programme organiser .
Moreover , evaluation analyses whether the programme emphasises successful learning and how the issues presented can be put into practice .
The provider is responsible for the quality of implementation , programme objectives , tasks and planned results .
Chapter 5 - Accreditation and Evaluation of In @-@ Service Teacher Education
Although regulations do not exist in Cyprus , Ireland and Slovakia , practices show a pattern of regularity .
Annual Between one and three years Every three years Every four years Every five years Every six years
Spain : Frequency varies , although it generally takes place once a year , depending on the Autonomous Community .
Ireland : A sample of all inservice programmes is evaluated annually .
Italy : Evaluation should be carried out periodically .
Legislation does not specify further .
In Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
In Hungary , new programmes can be accredited every year or whenever applications are made .
Programme providers can decide to start inservice education programmes anytime .
However , the accreditation procedure coordinated by the Inservice Teacher Training Accrediting Body is the condition for starting a programme .
Programmes are then accredited for five years . If providers want to continue their programmes after the fifth year , they must go through the accreditation procedure again .
Programme providers are also required to carry out selfevaluation procedures .
Furthermore , the SuliNova Kht ( a non @-@ profit organisation ) monitors inservice teacher education programmes by means of a selfevaluation questionnaire .
In Poland , the ministry of education supervises and approves the National Centre of Inservice Training activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
Every year , the Regional Educational Authorities ( kuratoria ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of inservice teacher education institutions in their respective region . Another obligation of the REA
In Slovenia , according to regulations which have been in place since the 2004 / 05 school year , only part of inservice courses are accredited each year .
In 2005 , for instance , the programme council decided to review the cluster of refresher courses and courses for the professional development of teachers .
In 2006 , courses on whole @-@ school issues will be the focus of evaluation .
The results of the accreditation and evaluation of inservice education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( Chapter 4 ) .
In the Czech Republic , accreditation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Accreditation Commission .
The Ministry has the right to control the accredited programmes during the period of accreditation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
In the event that the provider does not fulfil the programme , the accreditation can be withdrawn .
The maintainer of a school may check if inservice programmes for teachers correspond to the pedagogical programme of the school .
In Latvia , the commission has the right to withdraw approval given to a programme if there is proof that it has failed to meet requirements .
In Poland , negative evaluation findings can result in the accreditation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for inservice courses to be channelled into other training institutions .
In Portugal , there is an initial accreditation process for the institution or programme .
This accreditation may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn if there is proof of irregularities .
In Slovenia , the main aim of an accreditation procedure is for formal programme offers to be selected following a public tender .
Evaluation findings are generally also used for improvement of provision .
In Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @-@ making with respect to the goals , processes and instructors of the programmes .
Evaluation and accreditation results may also be provided as information to various players involved in the planning of inservice teacher education activities .
In the Netherlands , accreditation results are published on the website of the Nederlands @-@ Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie ( NVAO , or Accreditation Organisation of The Netherlands and Flanders ) .
These reports are then sent to the Council for Programmes of Continuing Education and Training of Professional Staff of Schools and Kindergartens .
On the basis of these reports , an overall national report is prepared and is discussed and assessed by the Council before being sent to the minister of education .
In Romania , accredited teacher training programmes are published in a list used by teachers for the selection of the inservice training course that they must attend every five years .
CHAPTER 6 REFORMS AND DEBATE
First , institutions or programmes for initial teacher education are in general part of higher education and are therefore also
These reforms have been referred to in previous chapters .
The debates and reforms described below are concerned with two main questions which relate directly to teacher education .
Many countries have begun reforms of the organisation of initial teacher education and inservice training sometimes in relation to the Bologna process , or are intending to do so .
The situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adapt procedures for evaluating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
A limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . Such debates are described in the second section .
This last trend is becoming increasingly more widespread in Europe .
The introduction of the two @-@ cycle ( bachelor / master ) structure in several Länder in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
Later , it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that , in order to be granted this recognition , courses had to be structured in modules , accredited and therefore evaluated beforehand .
The previous system of evaluation sought to ensure that the regulations were complied with .
Ongoing debate on the evaluation of initial and inservice education is examining how far evaluation of this kind should become general practice and whether it achieves its aims .
Later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and compulsory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
In Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . A decree on the definition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
The decree includes definitions of the criteria and procedures for monitoring and evaluating the outcome of teacher education provided as part of the master programme .
The decree is not yet implemented , as further decisions are still required concerning the curriculum and recruitment procedures to be connected with initial education .
In Latvia , improvements in the system of inservice teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
In the case of quality assurance , recommendations should be submitted to the Welsh Assembly Government by January 2007 .
Quality assurance in initial teacher education

Quality Assurance Agency
Kuratoria ( Regional Educational Authorities )
Concurrent model : An initial teacher education programme which , from the outset , combines general teacher education in one or more subjects with theoretical and practical professional teacher training .
Consecutive model : A two @-@ stage initial teacher education programme .
Students first receive general education in order to obtain a degree in a particular subject or branch of study .
At or near the end of this period of study , they enrol in a programme of initial professional training , enabling them to qualify as teachers .
Evaluation : The general process of a systematic and critical analysis leading to judgments and / or recommendations for improvement regarding the quality of a ( teacher ) education institution or programme .
Synonyms : Assessment , audit , peer review , quality assessment , review .
Evaluation criteria : Checkpoints by which the attainment of certain objectives and / or standards can be examined .
They describe the characteristics of the requirements and conditions to be met , and therefore provide the ( quantitative and / or qualitative ) basis on which an evaluative conclusion is drawn .
Expert in evaluation : A person experienced and qualified in the evaluation of institutions and / or its staff .
S / he may have various professional backgrounds , for example in research , teaching or management positions .
External evaluation : The process whereby a specialised external body collects data , information and evidence about an institution or a programme , in order to make a statement about its quality .
External evaluation is normally carried out by a team of external experts , peers or inspectors . Synonym : External review .
General teacher education : General courses and mastery of the subject ( s ) that trainees will teach when qualified .
The purpose of these courses , therefore , is to provide trainees with a thorough knowledge of one or more subjects and good general knowledge .
Inspector : A person evaluating the quality of educational provisions who works within the body of an educational authority .
S / he may be trained as a teacher and / or have an administrative background .
Internal evaluation : A process carried out under the responsibility of those working within an institution , consisting of the systematic collection of administrative data and the questioning of students , lecturers and other staff .
It may be considered as a collective institutional reflection and an opportunity for quality enhancement .
Peer : Academic of the same higher education discipline , specialist in the field reviewed .
Works outside of the institution / programmes evaluated .
Professional teacher training : Part of the initial teacher education programme which provides future teachers with both theoretical and practical insight into their future profession .
Qualification standards : A set of core competencies , relevant knowledge and skills within a study programme , i.e. everything a future teacher should know and be able to do .
This level of requirements must be attained by student teachers in order to obtain a teaching qualification .
Qualification standards shape what goes into the curriculum of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
Recommendation : Non @-@ statutory guidelines which are of an advisory nature , issued by the top @-@ level education authorities .
Regulation : A law , decree or any other officially binding document , issued by the top @-@ level education authorities .
Site visit : A component of external evaluation .
Standards : Statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be attained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredited or certified .
International Standard Classification of Education ( ISCED 1997 )
The International Standard Classification of Education ( ISCED ) is an instrument suitable for compiling statistics on education internationally .
For more information on ISCED 97 , readers should consult the official website : http : / / unescostat.unesco.org / en / pub / pub0.htm.
ISCED 1 : Primary education
This level begins between 5 and 7 years of age , is compulsory in all countries and generally lasts from four to six years .
ISCED 2 : Lower secondary education
It continues the basic programmes of the primary level , although teaching is typically more subject @-@ focused .
Usually , the end of this level coincides with the end of compulsory education .
In some countries compulsory education is provided in a single structure without a transition between the primary and lower secondary levels .
ISCED 3 : Upper secondary education
This level generally begins at the end of compulsory education .
The entrance age is typically 15 or 16 years .
Entrance qualifications ( end of compulsory education ) and other minimum entry requirements are usually needed .
Instruction is often more subject @-@ oriented than at ISCED level 2 .
The typical duration of ISCED level 3 varies from two to five years .

Quality Assurance in Teacher Education in Europe .
This document is published by the Eurydice European Unit with the financial support of the European Commission ( Directorate @-@ General for Education and Culture ) .
Requests for permission to reproduce the entire document must be made to the European Unit .
Preface
Every education system and national education policy uses its own specific terminology to describe the characteristics of its organisation and operation .
In trying to understand and make reliable comparisons of how the various education systems in Europe really work , we are often confronted with questions of terminology .
For these reasons , the Eurydice Network in 1999 launched a series entitled the European Glossary on Education .
Turkey which is also a member of the Eurydice Network did not contribute to this Glossary .
The present volume belongs to a set of publications that Eurydice is producing in 2007 to provide greater insight into interrelated aspects of higher education .
A guide to the use of the Glossary is presented by way of introduction .
It contains all relevant definitions and outlines the different aspects covered in the explanatory note on each term .
This fifth volume is the result of very close cooperation between the Eurydice National Units and the Eurydice European Unit ( EEU ) .
Decision @-@ making , Advisory , Operational and Regulatory Bodies in Higher Education
This glossary covers bodies with responsibilities in the area of decision @-@ making , advisory , operational or regulatory duties , or responsibilities concerned with quality assurance in higher education .
For the purposes of this glossary , a formal body is defined as a public or private entity recognised in law by the public authorities .
It may be known as a board , council , institution , agency , etc .
All types of higher education ( academic , professional , artistic , etc . ) including adult education and distance education are covered .

Educational Institution
Important national characteristics
There are two higher education institutes in Malta : the University of Malta and , from September 2006 , the Malta College of Arts , Science and Technology .
A number of bodies in the Netherlands play an important and influential part in the policy process , and consequently have an influence on higher education .
These bodies include the Raad van State , which advises the government and parliament on legislation and governance and is the country 's highest administrative court .
No regulation or law can pass without a judgement from the Raad van State . The Interdepartmentale Commissie voor Economische Structuurversterking makes recommendations to Cabinet on financial and economic issues .
As a result , bodies responsible for management / supervision operate at two levels , central and institutional .
Bodies operating at central level are mainly involved in evaluation , accreditation , financing and quality assurance of higher education .
At institutional level , bodies are involved in the educational and administrative management of higher education institutions and their departments .
Academic board Council Court Governing body Senate
The UK Government has devolved some of its powers , including responsibility for education , to the devolved administrations in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Institutions with degree awarding powers decide the degrees they offer and the conditions on which they are awarded .
In institutions without degree awarding powers , qualifications are validated by a university or national accrediting body .
In England , Scotland and Wales , higher education institutions are funded centrally by intermediary bodies , at arms " length from government .

What does the future hold for the European Economic and Social Committee ?
The Nice Treaty defines the Committee as the institutional bodyresponsible for representing civil society organisations .
- presentation of investigative reports on topics chosen in close cooperation withthe interest groups concerned ;
- preparation of opinions on the Commission 's annual or half @-@ yearly reports on thesingle market economic reform ( Cardiff process ) ; and
What are the EESC 's current priority objectives ?
Over and above its consultative role , the Committee is working to set up a model ofparticipatory democracy throughout Europe and the rest of the world .
It contributesto the development of socioeconomic organisations in civil society , including incountries applying to join the EU .
Through the Convention , it fully participates in thedebate on the future of Europe and preparations for the next IGC .
The Committee 's work programme is based on the European Commission 's work programme , the priorities ofeach Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the work programme presented by each Committee president upon election .
What are the links between the European Economic and Social Committee and the national economic and social councilsandother similar bodies ?
The EESC has developed close cooperation with economic and social councils andsimilar institutions .
It also participates actively in the work of the International Association of Economicand Social Councils and Similar Institutions ( IAESCSI ) , the members of which span50 countries .
Lastly , the EESC maintains regular relations with civil society organisations in the countries applying for EU membership and in several countries or country groupings outside the European Union .
These activities are carried out jointly with the economicand social councils in the Member States comprising such organisations .
How are EESC members appointed ?
What added value does the EESC bring ?
The EESC 's contribution to European integration is threefold :
The European Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body set up by the Rome Treaties in 1957 .
These menand women work actively " in the field " in the economic and social life of their country .
This pool of expertise is backed up by specific working methods , such as theuse of study groups , experts and hearings ;
- secondly , the Committee is a place for studying issues and hammering out solutions based on compromise , even where the initial stances are divergent or evendiametrically opposite ;
How does the EESC operate ?
The Committee adopts on average 150 opinions a year on a wide range of subjects concerning European integration .
It therefore plays an active role in the Community decisionmaking process .
- finally , its members " professional origins mean that the Committee is a focal pointfor the questions and aspirations of civil society organisations regarding all aspectsof European integration .
The Committee comprises six specialist sections covering a very wide range of Community spheres of responsibility :
The Committee holds structureddialogue with representatives of civil society organisations in these countries andregions , and promotes the creation of consultative structures based on its own model .
Through the role assigned to it by the Treaties , and thanks to its broad membershipand their expertise , the EESC constitutes a valuable forum for representing andinforming civil society organisations and expressing their views .
It speaks on behalfof these organisations to the European institutions and in doing so acts as a uniquebridge between Europe and its people .
In addition , following expiry of the ECSC Treaty in July 2002 and on a proposal bythe European Commission , the Committee was asked to assume the responsibilitiesof the ECSC 's Consultative Committee .
This composition will be gradually extended to include other sectors affected by problems caused by the modernisation of the economy , and to all the interested parties concerned .
Hence the CCIC 'sremit is not limited to the coal and steel sectors alone , but also takes account of allaspects of industrial change .
What is the impact of the EESC 's work ?
The size of these study groups varies from 3 to 15 members , depending on the importance of the subject . Rapporteurs can also call on external expertsto assist them .
The last EESC renewal - which covers the next four @-@ year period - took place in October 2002 .
A total of 40 % of members were newly appointed .
The Committee Secretariat will be headed by Mr Patrick Venturini , Secretary @-@ General .

The subjectsof audits vary considerably from financial statements to detailed examinations of specific budgetary areasor management topics .
Audit tasks are divided into : recurrentaudit tasks , which according to the Treaty , the Court is required to undertake each year .
These include the audit of the financial statements of the European Union , the European Development Funds and of allother bodies and agencies set up by the Union ; and selectedaudit tasks , where the Court selects budgetary areas or management topics of specific interest fordetailed audit .
The European Court of Auditors organises and carries out its audit work independentlyof the other EU institutionsand national governments .
In line with other public audit institutions , the Court does not audit every budgetary area in depth every year , but aselection of budgetary or management topics .
The potential tasks are ranked by priority on the basis of both the results of the risk analysisand the need to ensure a balanced coverage of budgetary areas .
Other factors considered when making the final selectionof audit tasks include the specific concerns of the European Parliament , the Council and the public at large .
The Court carries out its audits in accordance with its own audit policies and standards , which adapt generallyaccepted international standards to the European Union context .

Adding value to financial management
Thisincludes making suggestions on how to cost @-@ effectively : improve compliance with legislation ; reduce the risk of errors and irregularities ; improve the organisation of European Union activities and its internal control systems ; make the European Union 's actions more transparent by improving accounting methods and procedures ; andachieve EU policy objectives more effectively and efficiently .
Irregularities and fraud
The European Court of Auditors reports on any irregularities and suspectedfraud .
The Court assesses how well the Commission and the Member States fulfil their responsibilitiesin this field and identifies how improvements could be made .

AUDIT APPROACH
In line with other public audit institutions , the European Court of Auditors undertakes two different types of audit , namely financial auditand sound financial management audit .
Reliability of the accounts : Are the financial statements complete and accurate ?
In general , these comprise a balance sheet , aneconomic outturn account , a cash @-@ flow table , a statement of changes in capital and explanatory notes .
Legality and regularity : Has the income been collected and expenditure incurred in conformity with all relevantrules and regulations ?
The Treaties and the Financial Regulation require the Court to audit the legality and regularity of the transactions bywhich the EU finances and implements its budget .
The objectiveis to ensure that transactions have been executed in accordance with the relevantrules andregulations , that they exist in reality , have been correctly calculated and that the beneficiaries of EU aid havefulfilled their obligations .
The audit covers all aspects from receipt or payment by the Commission throughdifferent levels of administration down to individual elements of EU revenue or receipt by the final beneficiary .
The DAS is based on the results of detailed financialaudits .
The specific appraisals are based on the following :
Assessment of the functioning of the internal control systems ( particularly the supervisory systems ) both at the Commission and in Member and beneficiary States ; Audit evidencebased on the testing of a sample of transactions from each budgetary field ; Evidence arising from the audits of EU finances carried out by other auditors ; and Examination of the annual activity reports and declarationsissued by the Directors @-@ General of the European Commission .
The DAS specific appraisals include monitoring elementsin order to provide an objective assessment of the quality offinancial management and to allow the monitoring of progress over time .
The DAS statement , with accompanying information , is published in the Court 's Annual Report , which the Courtdelivers to the European Parliament and Council .
The statement is also published with the financial statements of the European Union in the Official Journal .
Similar opinions are provided on the financial statements of the European Union 's agencies and bodies .
Sound financial management audit
Value for money : Have the funds been managed in an economic , efficient and effective manner , providingvalue for money for the citizens of the Union ?
According to the Financial Regulation , EU funds should be managed based on the principles of : economy
For a given output or objective , the minimum amount of funds have been used .
Best value has been obtained for the money spent .
The objectives of the EU policy have been met .
The Court , in common with other public audit bodies , has two different approaches to sound financial managementaudits , depending on the topic under audit and the risks involved .
The first approach is to evaluate the management of the expenditure , and particularly the measures taken to achievevalue for money .
This involves making an evaluation of the approach taken by management and the systems usedfor ensuring value for money and testing the decisions taken .
The audit concludes on whether the approach takenby management was likely to ensure value for money , and if not , how it could be improved .
The second approach comprises an assessment of whether a given programme or project met its objectives and achievedvalue for money .
This involves an examination of whether , and how , the objectives of the specific expenditure wereachievedand an assessment of whether the minimum resources were used for that outcome .
The audit concludes onwhether value for money was achieved for the programme , and if not , how it could be improved .
GENERAL AUDIT OBJECTIVES

Efficiency the resources used to meet the objectives of the action provide an optimal ratio between inputs and outputs
Effectiveness the extent to which objectives are achieved and the relationship between intended and actual impact
Each audit is carried out in three main stages : planning ; testing ; and reporting .
The Court undertakes the planning of its work programme on a multiannual and annual basis .
The multiannual plan allows the Court 's strategy to be defined and updated , and the annualplan sets out the specific tasks to be undertakenduring the year in question .
The auditorsmake a detailed evaluation of the risks involved and identify sources of potential audit evidence .
This informationhelps the auditors define the general and detailed audit objectives and the type and extent of detailed testingneeded to meet them .
Audit objectives are a precise statement of what the audit intends to accomplish and / or thequestions the audit will answer .
The preliminary study report concludes with an assessment of the expected impactof a detailed audit and its overall cost .
For every audit undertaken , the auditors prepare an audit planning memorandum which sets out the audit scope , approach and objectives , and how these are to be achieved in the most efficient and cost @-@ effective way .
It includes detailsof the human and other resources needed to complete the task and practical information such as countries to be visitedand how audit evidence is to be collected , as well as the audit timetable .
The planning memorandum is complementedby an audit programmewhich sets out the audit testing needed in detail .
The audit planning memoranda and audit programmes are submitted for approvalto the audit group responsible .
The purpose of audit testing is to obtain sufficient , relevant and reliable audit evidence to allow the auditors toreach conclusions on the audit objectives .
Audit testingis undertaken by audit teams of two or three staff .
The auditors collect evidence in accordance withthe audit programme , both within the European Union institutions and on @-@ the @-@ spot in Member and beneficiary States .
Depending on the type of audit , this usually involves the examination and testing of systems and transactionsat all relevant administrative levels .
Statistical samplingtechniques are often used as an efficient way of obtaininga representative view of a population of transactions .
For some audits the Court uses external expertstoprovide specific specialist knowledge .
Audit evidenceis obtained by the auditor in a number of ways , generally involving examinationof keysupporting documentation , physical inspectionand enquiry .
The type of evidence needed depends on the transactionor audit subject in question and , in particular , on the conditions for receiving the EU aid .
Systems based audit approach
Audits generally involve the direct testing of a sample of transactions in order to obtain the necessary supporting evidence .
However , the extent of this testing can be reduced when reliance is placed on the internal control systems , where it is possible and economic to do so .
If the audit testing shows that the systems are well conceived and operating effectively , the amount of direct testingof transactions necessary to meet the audit objectives can be reduced .
The purpose of the statement is to allow the auditees to confirm the factual accuracy of the Court 's audit findingsand to give them the opportunity to provide any further information or explanations that may be necessary .
Once the auditors have obtained sufficient , relevant and reliable audit evidence , the information is analysed and used asa basis to arrive at conclusionson each of the audit objectives .
The purpose of audit reports is to communicate the results of the Court 's work to the auditee , the discharge authorityand the general public .
The publication of audit reports is an important element for ensuring transparency within theprocess of oversight over the management and use of EU funds .
The draft audit report is examined first by the audit group and then submitted for approval by the Court .
This reply takes into account the reactions of the Member States .
Depending on thereply , the Court either maintains its original observations or modifies them to correct any errors or misunderstandings .
The auditee 's reply is published with the audit report .

The European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour

Luxembourg : Office for Official Publications of the European Communities , 2005
Dear reader ,
On the one hand , the Ombudsman acts as an external mechanism of control , investigating complaints about maladministration and recommending corrective action where necessary .
But equally the Code serves as a useful guide and a resource for civil servants , encouraging the highest standards of administration .
With the Charter making up Part II of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , we can be sure that this right will become increasingly meaningful in the coming years .
Citizens and officials have shown much interest in the Code since its adoption by the European Parliament in September 2001 .
As European Ombudsman , I feel it is my duty to further raise awareness of the rights and obligations contained therein .
It is for this reason that we have chosen to publish a new version in all of the official EU languages , as well as in the languages of the candidate countries .
I hope that the Code will continue to serve as a useful working tool for public administrations and as a reference point for citizens all over Europe .
e Code takes account of the principles of European administrative law contained in the case law of the Court of Justice and also draws inspiration from national laws .
The European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour e Charter includes as fundamental rights of Union citizenship the right to good administration ( art .
is Code is intended to explain in more detail what the Charter  s right to good administration should mean in practice .
Right to good administration
( Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
1 Every person has the right to have his or her a airs handled impartially , fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union .
2 This right includes :
- the right of every person to be heard , before any individual measure which would a ect him or her adversely is taken ;
- the right of every person to have access to his or her le , while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy ;
- the obligation of the administration to give reasons for its decisions .
4 Every person may write to the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of the Treaties and must have an answer in the same language .
" maladministration occurs when a public body fails to act in accordance with a rule or principle which is binding upon it . "
is definition has been approved by the European Parliament .

• complaints against national , regional or local authorities in the Member States , even when the complaints are about EU matters .
The Ombudsman may simply need to inform the institution concerned about a complaint in order for it to resolve the problem .
If the case is not resolved satisfactorily during the course of his inquiries , the Ombudsman will try , if possible , to find a friendly solution which puts right the case of maladministration and satisfies the complainant .
If the attempt at conciliation fails , the Ombudsman can make recommendations to solve the case .

European Defence Agency ( EDA )
The European Union Institute for Security Studies was created by a Council joint action on 20 July 2001 .
Its aim is to help create a common European security culture , to support the strategic debate by providing the best possible interface between Euro -pean decisionmakers and the diverse circles of non @-@ official specialists .
The institute 's activities are directed towards data analysis and recommendations necessary for EU policymaking .
Consequently , the institute contributes to the development of the European Union common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) by executing several main tasks : research and debate on the major security and defence issues that are of relevance to the EU ; forward @-@ looking analysis for the Union 's Council and High Representative ; and development of a transatlantic dialogue on all security issues with the countries of Europe , Canada and the United States .
The institute has an autonomous status and intellectual freedom , which means that it does not represent or defend any particular national interest .
Illicit drug use and trafficking are worldwide phenomena that threaten health and social stability .
Statistics show that one European citizen dies every hour from a drug overdose and close to 8 000 Europeans lose their lives to drugs every year .
Meanwhile , ever @-@ changing patterns in supply and demand call for constant monitoring and dynamic responses .
Independent , science @-@ based information is a vital resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them .
It was on this premise , and in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon , that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) was established in 1993 .
Inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995 , it is one of the EU 's decentralised agencies .
The EMCDDA exists to provide the EU and its Member States with a factual overview of European drug problems and a solid evidence base to support the drugs debate .
Today it offers policymakers the data they need for drawing up informed drug laws and strategies .
It also helps professionals and practitioners working in the field pinpoint best practice and new areas of research .
At the heart of the agency 's work is the promotion of scientific excellence .
To achieve its core task of providing sound and comparable information on drugs in Europe , the EMCDDA has developed the infrastructure and tools needed to collect country data in a harmonised way .
These data are then fed by national drug monitoring centres ( Reitox network ) to the Lisbon agency for analysis , resulting in a variety of information products conveying the broader European picture .
While the EMCDDA is primarily European in focus , it also works with partners in other world regions , exchanging information and expertise .
Collaboration with European and international organisations in the drugs field is also central to its work as a means of enhancing understanding of the global drugs phenomenon .
The EMCDDA works on the principle that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs .
Although it does not propose policy , the agency is now making a clear impact on decision @-@ making through its analyses , standards and tools .
What we do
The state of the drugs problem in Europe
The EMCDDA 's main output is its yearly overview of the European drug phenomenon which it presents in a multilingual annual report package .
This is essential reading for policymakers , scientists and practitioners in the drugs field or anyone seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .

Monitoring the drug situation
These bodies are the main information interface between the EMCDDA and its Member States .
As such , they provide national drug information to the agency for EU @-@ level analysis and play the role of EMCDDA " ambassadors " at home .
Understanding the nature and scale of the drugs problem is a critical requirement for effective policymaking and action .
The EMCDDA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools ( e.g. key indicators , core datasets ) which offer countries a " common language " with which to interpret the drug phenomenon .
As well as monitoring the drug situation today , the EMCDDA is ever vigilant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies .
Here it plays an active role in early @-@ warning and risk @-@ assessment activities through legal instruments and case studies .
Responding to drug problems n u l l
Monitoring drug interventions , laws and policies is firmly enshrined in the EMCDDA 's work .
By providing a European overview of such responses to drug problems , it helps countries follow trends and design appropriate strategies .

Conclusions
Initially , there was no reference framework available - observatories were set up using trial and error , taking into account different national contexts and resources .
This explains why today there are as many models of observatories as there are countries establishing them .
Starting from a highly heterogeneous group of drugs observatories across different continents , the endeavour is to extract the essence of their experience and to transmit the final result in such a way that it can be reinterpreted in other realities and conditions .
Although this is the outcome of a long elaboration and reflection process , the handbook itself should be considered more as a starting point , rather than as a final achievement .
Building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook documents .
Over time , the toolbox will develop with the help of readers and operational national drugs observatories : it will provide a platform for sharing practical materials and reference models .

Chapter 1Why do we need a national drugs observatory ?
What is a national drugs observatory ( NDO ) ?
What is its role ?
What are the duties and the competences of such an institution ?
How can one set up an observatory ?
These are only a few of the questions that this handbook tries to address in a practical manner , starting with the most important one : why do we need a national drugs observatory ?
A growing need for monitoring
The adoption of the United Nations Conventions (
States to regularly report on the drugs situation as well as on interventions , covering both supply and demand .
One of the first consequences of this formalised approach was an acknowledgement of the need to set up national monitoring systems and observatories .
" Evidence base " : a new concept for policymaking
Since the mid @-@ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @-@ based policy @-@ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
This change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions , and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful .
Similarly , the public is increasingly demanding this sort of information from its leaders .
From monitoring to evaluation
2 the Political Declaration and Plan of Action ( ... ) " (
A key role for national observatories
What we can conclude from the various working groups , public and expert debates that took place in 2008 and 2009 and that are still ongoing , is very simple :
• supranational or international drug information networks can only work if they receive high quality , comparable information from their respective participating countries ;
• national drugs observatories can make a key contribution to international community efforts on data collection , analysis and interpretation ;
• a national drugs observatory is a key instrument for policymaking - it is not a political instrument .
Whilst the political responsibility remains in the hands of decision @-@ makers , there is a growing consensus that they need objective , factual , reliable and comparable information in order to take informed decisions .
This handbook targets the needs of three groups , with a specific objective for each of them :
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership ( 3 ) , and neighbourhood countries ( 4 ) that wish and / or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs , such as the Interamerican Drugs Observatory CICAD @-@ OAS , to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and / or to consolidate their national observatories ;
• non @-@ EU countries involved in a cooperation on drugs matters with the EU and with other
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
We must inform the reader of the following in relation to this publication :
• this handbook builds on the experience of establishing and developing a European data collection network composed by national focal points - the Reitox network .
Although it presents a conceptual framework , it is based on practice in establishing the network 15 years ago , and in expanding it to more than 15 new countries since then .
We have tried to identify the key principles and functions that have proven successful over the years ;
• we do not offer a single model to be copied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sorts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a structured analysis of each national context .
This handbook provides the reader with a matrix for this strategic and operational analysis ;
The handbook is divided into several parts :
• What is a national drugs observatory ( Chapter 2 ) • Running a national drugs observatory :
A national drugs observatory ( NDO ) is an organisation that provides its country with factual , objective , reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences .
The objectives of the NDO are :
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policymaking and for the organisation of drug @-@ related services , and on drug @-@ related issues of general interest ;
• to collect and to produce the information needed to fulfil its country 's reporting obligations to supranational and international monitoring and drug @-@ control programmes .
To reach its objectives , the NDO must perform three core functions , either with its own resources or in conjunction with other national institutions and experts :
• data collection and monitoring at national level ; • analysis and interpretation of the information collected ; • reporting and dissemination of the results .
The main publication produced by the NDO on a yearly basis is its national report or at least an update on the national situation .
In addition to this report , an NDO may be expected to produce ad hoc studies and other reports .
While establishing or evaluating the position of a national drugs observatory , it is also necessary to assess its success and sustainability using three key strategic factors :
• perceived added value ; • availability and combination of resources ; and • cooperative production processes .
A national drugs observatory ( NDO ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - factual , objective , reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and
1 drug addiction (
) , and their consequences .
According to national priorities , the scope of the work of the NDO may focus only on illicit drugs , or could also cover alcohol , tobacco and other licit drugs ( such as prescription drugs ) .
We limit our presentation here to illicit drugs as these are the primary mandate of the EMCDDA and CICAD @-@ OAS .
An NDO is ideally part of a broader system that combines :
• a concerted and balanced national drugs coordination mechanism , which oversees the various actors implementing a national drugs strategy ;
• a national drugs information network , that integrates specialised and general sources of information and expertise , as well as routine surveillance programmes and ad hoc surveys on target groups .
The NDO collects and produces information for two main audiences : national and supra- or international .
National audience : the NDO addresses the information needs of four groups of customers which make up its audience at national level : decision @-@ makers , the scientific community , professionals working in the drugs field , and the general public .
As far as the work of an NDO is concerned , we use the term " core functions " to describe the key processes to be developed and implemented by the NDO .
In order to present the core functions of an NDO , we have adapted the concept of " business process . "
What is " business process " ?
Davenport and Short ( 1990 ) define business process as " a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome . "
A process is " a structured , measured set of activities designed to produce a specified output for a particular customer or market . It
2 implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organisation " (
Business processes have four common characteristics :
Cross @-@ organisational boundaries : the NDO relies on a multi @-@ partner cooperation framework , on intensive networking practices that allow the NDO to acquire the expertise and information needed .
This implies a permanent screening of its environment and frequent adjustments in the modus operandi negotiated with all partners .
Customers or stakeholders : in organisations based in or depending on the public sector , stakeholders play a vital role because they attract funds and allow the NDO to operate .
Malhotra , Y. , " Business process redesign : an overview , " IEEE Engineering Management Review , volume 26 , No 3 , Autumn 1998 .
Process : the emphasis is on how activities are organised and how results are obtained .
The processes may be structured differently , according to context , resources and capabilities , provided that the expected outputs are clearly defined and are produced on time .
Output : each of the core functions should deliver outputs , whether raw data or specific information , analytical reports , targeted publications or standard reporting .
The three core functions of an NDO are :
• data collection and monitoring • analysis and interpretation of the data collected • reporting and dissemination of results .
The core functions are usually carried out by the NDO in conjunction with other national institutions and experts .
Depending on the resources and the mandate of the NDO , and on the data and expertise available in the country , a range of possible set @-@ ups are possible , as presented in Chapter 7 - Challenging questions ) .
In the European Union , this is the role of the EMCDDA 's national focal points , which together form the European network for data collection on drugs , called Reitox ( Réseau Européen d 'Information sur les Toxicomanies ) .
Data collection and monitoring at national level
Various kinds of drug @-@ related information are usually already produced in some form by agencies at local or national level .
In such cases , the NDO can have the role of bringing together all available information into a national picture .
In order to do so , the NDO must first identify what information is available and create an " information map . "
This is a document that identifies and classifies potential data providers of drugs information and partner organisations .
Part of the work of an NDO consists of " scanning " national sources of drug @-@ related information to identify strengths and gaps .
In order to gather , produce , analyse and disseminate information in a regular manner , the NDO must build a sustainable network that is able to work continuously on its own improvement .
One of the main tasks of the NDO is to establish a national drug information network together with the partners and resources identified in the information map .
The drugs phenomenon and its impact on society are permanently changing .
Science , and our knowledge and understanding of the drugs phenomenon , are also in constant evolution .
The demands placed on the drugs information network must therefore be responsive to change .
In other words , developing the drug information network , and the related networking tasks , is part of an ongoing process that represents the NDO 's principal and most time @-@ consuming activity .
A key task is to liaise with information or data providers , and to motivate them to participate and contribute to the national drug information network .
Another ongoing aspect of developing the aforementioned network is a constant effort to improve the knowledge base .
This may be achieved either by improving existing processes and national reporting standards , and / or by establishing new sources of information .
The ability to raise awareness and funds for improving the national data collection network is extremely useful in this context .
The NDO needs staff with excellent communication and negotiation skills and a proven capacity for consensus @-@ building .
The challenge for the NDO lies in the constant and mutual interconnection of supply- and demandrelated information networks , in a way that offers added value for all partners and is logistically feasible .
Analysis and interpretation of the information collected
The information gathered by means of the drug information network needs further processing to be of practical use to the NDO 's audiences .
This is usually done by combining the analytical capacity of NDO staff and national experts .
The NDO progressively builds its expertise in providing rigorous scientific , unbiased and non @-@ speculative interpretation and analysis of the data collected , and in synthesising it into
The analysis and interpretation of the information collected should focus on :
• integrating information derived from different sources , covering a range of areas , in order to provide a comprehensive overview and understanding of the drugs situation .
To carry out these activities , the NDO must work with national institutions and other experts , so as to ensure :
• the progressive building of a common and comprehensive picture of the drugs situation in the country concerned ;
• shared ownership of the results by all partners involved .
Reporting and dissemination of results
Reporting and communicating results should be seen as one of the key tasks of the national drugs observatory .
Ultimately , outputs help justify the NDO 's existence , and they are one of the main reasons why it receives funds from national authorities and international organisations .
In most cases , the main publication produced by the NDO on a yearly basis will be a national report or an executive summary of the latest developments in the national context .
It is of particular importance that the NDO provides an update of the national drugs situation yearly , both for national and for international purposes .
In addition to the national report , the NDO may also be expected to produce reports on ad hoc studies and to provide evidence for the evaluation of national strategies and action plans .
• Combined resources : in practice , a successful NDO is the result of a combination of local , national and supranational resources , whether human , scientific and / or financial .
Therefore , special attention should be paid to identifying , articulating and consolidating these resources ;
A critical issue for the development and strengthening of the NDO lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other publications in cooperation with its national and local partners .
Chapter 3Running a national drugs observatory - data collection and monitoring
What are we looking for ?
How to proceed ?
What kind of data / information are needed ?
Monitoring and other drug @-@ related data collection activities started three decades ago in different regions of the world , under the auspices of various international and regional organisations .
In 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
1 supranational organisations , called the Lisbon Consensus (
The full document can be found on the UNODC website at the following link : http : / / www.unodc.org / pdf / drug _ demand _ gap _ lisbon _ consensus.pdf
OAS ) , the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , the World Health Organization , the International Epidemiology Workgroup and the Global HIV Prevention Research Network .
The Lisbon Consensus identifies 13 areas of strategic / policy interest which are monitored using a range of tools and formats , by all supranational and international organisations :
• Drug consumption among the general population ( prevalence and incidence ) ;
• Drug consumption by young people ( prevalence and incidence ) ;
• Drug consumption by special or vulnerable populations ;
• Drug @-@ related morbidity ;
• Drug @-@ related emergency room visits ;
• Psychiatric morbidity directly attributed to drug consumption ;
• Drug @-@ related mortality ;
• Social exclusion and disadvantage ;
• Drug @-@ related crime ( violations of drug laws ; proportion of property crimes associated with drug consumption ; proportion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption ) ;
• Economic costs of drug consumption ;
Information on drug availability and drug markets .
Based on this list , each regional or international drug monitoring network has developed its own model taking into account its specific needs and its institutional environment , but the core data remain the same .
Further comments will be made in Chapter 5 , under the heading " Reporting to supranational and international organisations . "
The EMCDDA relies on a network of national focal points or national drugs observatories - the Reitox network - which is responsible for collecting the data at national level .
One of the key assets of this monitoring system is that it is compulsory for EU Member States
As such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transposition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
The European monitoring system developed by the EMCDDA (
) is structured so as to cover two main areas : " monitoring the situation " which covers epidemiology , crime and markets , and " monitoring responses " which covers interventions , law and policies .

Work in this area is structured around three main components : key epidemiological indicators , crime and markets and the action on new drugs .
5 key epidemiological indicators :
Drug situation : Epidemiology , crime and markets
General population surveys and youth surveys Problem drug use Treatment demand indicator Drug @-@ related deaths Drug @-@ related infectious diseases
Crime and markets :
Drug @-@ related crime Availability of illicit drugs
Action on new drugs :
Early warning system Risk assessment Control measures
Key epidemiological indicators (
These indicators underpin the EMCDDA 's reporting on trends and developments in the EU drug situation .
They are also used for the analysis of the coverage of responses or the assessment of the impact of policies and actions .
General population surveys and youth surveys
Prevalence and patterns of drug use among the general population are measured by probabilistic surveys of the adult and school population .
This key indicator collects data on the prevalence and incidence of problem drug use ( PDU ) at national and local level .
Problem drug use is defined as " injecting drug use or long @-@ duration / regular use of opioids , cocaine and / or amphetamines . "
The data sources employed to calculate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the routine information systems used in the country .
The treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next .
The treatment demand indicator ( TDI ) consists of recommendations regarding method , definitions and items to be collected in relation to problem drug users presenting to drug treatment facilities .
These data are collected and collated nationally , and delivered annually .
Drug @-@ related deaths and mortality among drug users
The aim of this indicator is to obtain statistics on the number and characteristics of people who die directly or indirectly as a consequence of drug use .
Drug @-@ related mortality is a complex phenomenon , which accounts for a considerable percentage of deaths among young people in many countries .
This epidemiological indicator has two components : deaths directly caused by illegal drugs ( drug @-@ induced deaths ) and mortality rates among problem drug users .
Drug @-@ related infectious diseases ( DRID )
The data is collected on IDUs each calendar year using two main methods .
These are : ( a ) surveys of IDUs that include
According to the situation outside Europe , it may be necessary to collect data on other infectious diseases that are related directly or indirectly to drug use or drugs users , such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections .
Crime and markets
Other data are collected to complement the picture of the drugs situation from a law enforcement perspective , targeting drug @-@ related crime and availability .
Drug @-@ related crime
Based on international literature and evaluation practices , the definition of drug @-@ related crime encompasses four categories :
• Psychopharmacological crimes : crimes committed under the influence of a psychoactive substance , as a result of its acute or chronic use .
• Economic @-@ compulsive crimes : crimes committed in order to obtain money ( or drugs ) to support drug use .
• Systemic crimes : crimes committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets , as part of the business of drug supply , distribution and use .
• Drug law offences : crimes committed in violation of drug ( and other related ) legislation .
Availability of illicit drugs
Drug seizures can be as much an indicator of law enforcement activity in terms of supply reduction as they are of drug availability , but if cross @-@ checked with qualitative information they may be a confirmation of drug flows .
Price and potency / purity of illicit drugs may both impact on the perceived availability of illicit drugs and reflect supply side factors ( affecting access to drugs ) .
As such , they are considered as indirect indicators of drug availability .
• an " early @-@ warning system " to identify new drugs as they appear on the European market ;
• a decision @-@ making process ( control measures ) through which these products may be placed under control in the EU Member States .
The action on new drugs mechanism :
• is a unique tool combining public health and law enforcement institutions and information , with the aim to provide a multidisciplinary risk assessment ;
• control measures that may be decided by the Council are mandatory for the EU Member States .
Monitoring responses - Interventions , law and policies
Work in this area is structured around four main components (
) : Best practice portal , demand reduction , interventions in the criminal justice system and national strategies , coordination mechanisms and legislation .
Responses - Interventions , law and policies .
Evidence of efficacy Tools for evaluation Standards and guidelines
Prevention Reduction of drug @-@ related harm Drug treatment Social reintegration
Interventions in the criminal justice system :
Situation and assistance to drug users in prisons Alternatives to prison Prevention of drug @-@ related crime
National strategies , coordination mechanisms and legislation Public expenditure
( 5 ) ( 6 ) http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / drug @-@ situation / new @-@ drugs For detailed information on the responses core data sets , see : http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / responses
The EMCDDA has developed an online resource for professionals , policymakers and researchers in the areas of drug @-@ related prevention , treatment , harm reduction and social reintegration .
The portal concentrates on illicit drugs and polydrug use and has a clear European focus .
Its main aim is to provide tools and standards to improve the quality of interventions and highlight examples of best practice across Europe .
Prevention
Since 1994 , a new framework for classifying prevention into universal , selective and indicated prevention interventions replaces the previous concepts of primary , secondary , and tertiary prevention .
The guiding principle of this new classification is the target population by assumptions concerning its risk for substance abuse , but not the overall objective or content of a prevention intervention , as was the case previously .
Reduction of drug @-@ related harm
Drug treatment
Ensuring the availability of , and access to , targeted and diversified treatment and improving the quality of treatment are core to reducing drug demand .
The EMCDDA collects information through several treatment monitoring tools which aim to :
• address the policies and interventions Member States have established to provide evidence @-@ based drug treatment .
More precisely , a specific tool is aimed at collecting data about the policies and organisational framework of drug treatment , as well as availability , accessibility and diversification of treatment ;
• collect data through which the quality assurance measures that countries have taken to achieve and maintain a high quality of treatment service provision can be documented ;
• collect quantitative data on the number of people reached by drug treatment in Member States , and more specifically the number of clients receiving substitution / maintenance treatment .
The EMCDDA has developed a monitoring tool which addresses the policies and interventions that Member States have established to protect drug users from further exclusion and to improve their social inclusion .
Interventions in the criminal justice system
This area of work covers three issues :
• the situation and assistance to drug users in prisons ; • law @-@ enforcement measures as an alternative to prison for drug offenders , and ;
• law @-@ enforcement measures especially targeting statutory diversions addressed at young offenders , in order to avoid their progression into the criminal justice system .
National strategies , coordination mechanisms and legislation
Monitoring national and Community drug strategies and policies and their impact on the drug situation is a key EMCDDA activity . It has three main objectives :
• monitoring and describing policies , their framework and their relevant context ; • contributing to policy analysis ; • contributing to policy evaluation .
The specific topics covered include :
• EU drugs strategy ( 2005 @-@ 12 ) and action plan ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) ; • EU drug legislation ; • national strategies / action plans on drugs ; • national drug legislation ; • coordination arrangements in the field of drugs ; • public expenditure on drugs .
The Inter @-@ American Observatory on Drugs ( OID )
The Inter @-@ American Observatory on Drugs ( OID ) is the Inter @-@ American Drug Abuse Control Commission 's ( CICAD ) statistical , information and scientific research branch .
The Observatory helps countries to improve the collection and analysis of drug @-@ related data : by promoting the establishment of national observatories and the use of standardised
Drug use epidemiology in Latin America and the Caribbean
The primary drug use research system at the OID is the Inter @-@ American Drug Use Data
) ( SIDUC ) , an epidemiology @-@ based system that comprises surveys on drug use for populations .
The SIDUC system applies standardised methodologies , in order to produce drug use data that are comparable across countries .
The objective of the system is to obtain timely , reliable and comparable data between countries .
This allows the OID to monitor the drug problem in the region based on a constellation of indicators :
• prevalence of substance use ( lifetime , past year and past month ) of illicit drugs and also alcohol and tobacco ;
In addition , the following research protocols to study the consequences of drug use have been developed or are currently under development : emergency rooms ; treatment centres ; and mortality associated with drug use .
Finally , three standardised protocols are available to study the relationship between drug use and crime in adult prisoners , juvenile offenders and arrestees .
In addition to quantitative research , the OID has carried out qualitative research studies on street children , and sex workers , among others .
It also works closely with several national governments in the Caribbean to establish solid information networks within the country .
These networks such as those in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago integrate information from the many social sectors that participate in and contribute to the fight against drugs .
The OID 's Research and Development Programme
Epidemiological research forms the foundation the OID 's work in Latin America and the Caribbean , and is the sine qua non of any drug information system .
In order to develop robust drug information networks throughout the region , the OID 's initial focus is to build a
Building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook solid epidemiology based network in each country , leading toward the development of trend data on drug use throughout the region .
To further support research and development , the OID developed the Latin American
Statistical Information
The OID 's statistical system for information on drug law enforcement information is the Inter @-@ American Uniform Drug Supply Statistical System ( CICDAT ) .
Drug Statistics Profiles by Country (
The OID programme estimates the human social and economic costs of drugs in the
The methodology is based on the " International Guidelines for Estimating the Costs of Drug Abuse " ( 11 ) ; published by the Canadian Centre on Substance
Abuse and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , and is comprised of 17 indicators in four areas : healthcare , crime , labour productivity , and other costs .
To date , cost studies have been carried out in Argentina , Barbados , Chile , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Mexico and Uruguay .
Colombia has also carried out a study on crime attributable to drug use through this programme .
These studies represent first studies of their kind in the region to quantify in economic terms the impact of the drug problem in these respective countries .
Strengthening drug observatories in Latin America and the Caribbean
The OID supports the development and establishment of drug observatories in the region .
To further this effort , the OID is embarking on a collaborative endeavor with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction to develop a methodological tool to
( 2001 ) , " The International Guidelines for Estimating the Costs of Drug Abuse , " The Canadian Centre on
Substance Abuse ( CCSA ) .
Although local data collection may already exist , the process of establishing a national drugs observatory is usually linked to the need to provide sub @-@ regional or international organisations with data on the national drugs situation .
This should be documented in a clear and concise manner for consideration by policymakers .
In many cases , an executive summary in national language ( s ) may be drafted to engage all possible stakeholders .
At this stage , there should be a summary document giving an overview of what can ideally be achieved within a few years .
International guidelines , data sets , specifications and protocols
Reference manuals and handbooks
These exist for some specific protocols and methodologies and you will find some examples in the online toolbox at http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / publications / joint / ndo @-@ handbook

TIPS FOR NDO BUILDING
When adopting a national reference framework for reporting :
• Adapt the relevant international reference framework into a national one , taking into account the NDO 's mandate and translate it in the national language ( s )
• Prepare an explanatory document presenting the NDO , its mandate , goals and objectives , the expected products / results ( up to three pages )
• Prepare an executive summary of the national reference framework with a short description of information needed , and stress the benefi t it will bring nationally .
Why make a map ?
Prior to setting up an NDO , drug @-@ related information already exists in some form or another at national level .
However , a problem frequently encountered is that this information is not collected in a coordinated and systematic manner , which may be compounded when some of the actors involved do not work together .
The objective of the information map is therefore twofold :
Sources of information / databases
The NDO must first identify what information is already available by identifying and classifying existing sources of information , covering both demand and supply .
This " information map " is not a one @-@ off exercise , but a living document that should be constantly updated to reflect new needs for information , or new data sources .
Available sources of expertise
Data in relation to the complex drug phenomenon are of little value if not put into context and analysed .
To identify national experts and professionals who could contribute either to a better understanding or to a better reporting of the national situation is very important .
The information map exercise therefore allows you to do the following :
• make an inventory of data and information available ; • establish a first contact with potential network members ; • promote the project of establishing a national drugs observatory .
How to prepare the map ?
At the start it can be difficult identifying who to contact and where to find them .
This is why a checklist is needed to identify areas , sectors and institutions to be contacted .
Once a group of institutions has been identified , a detailed search for persons and contact information can begin .
Such information is readily available nowadays , via the Internet or government directories .
These potential contacts are then included in the same checklist , in order to identify gaps and further investigation needed .
Figure 2 : Example of a checklist - drug @-@ related infectious diseases
Checklist : 5 key epidemiological indicators :
Public health institute
- General population surveys and youth surveys - Problem drug use - Treatment demand indicator - Drug @-@ related deaths - Drug @-@ related infectious diseases ( DRID )
Drug @-@ related infectious diseases
At this stage , before contacting people , it is useful to prepare a one page document presenting :
Once the relevant contact people have been identified , this summary document should be sent to them , in order to prepare the first meeting .
It is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " elevator pitch " in Chapter 6 ) .
Indeed , at the start of the information map process , the objective is to initiate contact with persons identified before sending any explanatory document .
Surveys , feasibility studies , letters or e @-@ mails are all good means of making a quick assessment , however , personal contact is essential to the success of any project .
People can facilitate or slow down the process , either because they find it interesting or because they feel threatened when sharing their data and possibly their responsibility .
Personal contact in order to build confidence and trust is therefore vital at this stage in the process .
Similarly , NDO key staff must meet contacts often , in order to identify and meet potential sources of expertise and ( hopefully ) future partners .
What should the information map contain ?
) See template and guidelines for the information map in the online toolbox at http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / publications / joint / ndo @-@ handbook
Building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook and / or expertise .
In principle , at this stage , the information gathered from partners should be accurate .
Some partners may be interested or reluctant to cooperate .
This point can be tackled when settingup the network .

Where wewant to be
Drug monitoring national referenceframework
Information map
When launching the information map exercise :
( 1 ) Identify key players ( 2 ) share your goals with them ( 3 ) organise a meeting to collect information
• Send an explanatory document so that your contacts can arrange meetings with potential sources of information and / or experts
• Arrange meetings with several experts / institutions representatives at once : this will help you gather more information and will help people to get to know each other
Why a national drug information system ?
By " system , " we mean a structured organisation of heterogeneous sources of information that is needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the drug situation .
The system describes sources and flows of information requested by the national reference framework .
The elements of this system are not bound necessarily by hierarchical relations and its financing does not come from a single source of funding .
At this stage we should make two observations :
• the process of constructing the system must be documented and monitored : this is the role of the national action plan for the drug information system ( NAPDIS - see p . 46 ) .
The information map is a prerequisite to organising the national drug information system .
The next step is to imagine and propose a structure for data collection and reporting , which describes in detail the possible contribution expected from each stakeholder and existing gaps in the information available .
At this point , consulting and informing potential actors is vital , to ensure buy @-@ in and support .
The proposal should include a clear description of work processes and communication channels .
A comprehensive national drug information system should have two main components : a national data collection network and a national drugs observatory :
Therefore the costs for establishing and maintaining a drug information system do not require a totally new budget .
This is more a question of articulating and combining various sources of information and funding , to identify where the gaps are , and to look for potential complementary solutions .
Once the proposal for a national drug information system is ready , it has to be approved by the national authorities .
In some cases , cooperation protocols may need to be concluded between different institutions and the NDO .
This may also apply when experts from different institutions are going to take part in the work of the NDO , for instance for drafting the national report .
The next step of the process involves the preparation of a national action plan for the drug information system ( NAPDIS ) , in which information is combined so as to identify objectives and actions to be undertaken .
The NAPDIS should give the guidelines for the work to be carried out over the years to come .
Therefore , what matters here is to identify and estimate for the concrete actions that will be launched as additional resources become available .
The NDO and partners will then be able to seek resources at a later stage .
The NAPDIS should also include three complementary tasks that are the responsibility of the national drugs observatory , according to its mandate and funding restrictions :
• Data collection : it is the responsibility of the NDO to identify gaps and needs for additional data collection exercises , and to convey this information to the national authorities .
According to available means , it may promote or even carry out new studies and surveys in order to bridge the knowledge gap .
The main aim is to ensure that any new survey or data collection exercise meets requirements and protocols presented in the national drug monitoring framework ;
For example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the EMCDDA 's five key epidemiological indicators ;
This is also where the NDO can be instrumental in identifying extra funding opportunities from international organisations .
With the NAPDIS , the NDO and its partners identifies what needs to be done long @-@ term in order to implement the drug monitoring reference framework , using the information map as a starting point .
However it is important to bear in mind that knowing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are merely long @-@ term goals .
Figure 4 : Links between the information map , the NAPDIS and the national monitoring reference framework
Where we want to be
What needs to be done
National action plan for the drug information system ( NAPDIS )
Once the NAPDIS is endorsed by its main stakeholders , then the NDO can prepare a yearly work programme .
In some countries , the two exercises ( NAPDIS + annual work plan ) are merged into a single document .
1 4 many cases is not the NDO 's responsibility (
) Ultimately , the NDO cannot take responsibility for decisions that are out of its reach , but it can help influence relevant decisions .
• ( 1 ) Prepare a proposal for a national drug information system , ( 2 ) get the national drug information system approved by national authorities , ( 3 ) prepare a national action plan ( NAPDIS )
• Think about the concrete outputs and their relevance • Build a transparent system
• Partnership is all about networking and not a hierarchical or centralised process - but money and mandate can help !
Why establish a national network ?
Networking and establishing partnerships serve four purposes :
• Combining sources of information / data ; • Pooling competences and analysis and reporting capacity ; • Sharing limited resources ;
• Establishing a basis for the improvement of data availability and quality , and for developing data analysis capacity .
The key principles underpinning this work are :
Equality of partners
All partners have the same rights and obligations , no pre @-@ eminence of any one in particular .
Network = leadership + participative management
The relationship between the partners is non @-@ hierarchical , but the network exists around a project which is coordinated under the leadership of the NDO .
It is the role of the NDO to keep the project on track , steering the collaborative process towards a common goal .
Respect of competences , authorship and ownership
Contributions by partners , especially in deliverables produced by the NDO , should be acknowledged ; competences available in the network should be used and recognised .
It is important that NDO staff know their own limits and build on complementary expertise .
All authors and contributors should be credited in any reports published .
Look for mutual benefit in the cooperation
The mandate and role of the NDO cannot ensure the participation of relevant experts alone , nor guarantee that the NDO receives quality data .
Motivation and participation cannot be commanded ; they are obtained through strong communication and clear mutual benefit .
Communication is vital
A network lives because of the information exchange between its members .
For networks being established following the initiative or request of the NDO and / or the national authorities , the coordination role of the NDO should be two @-@ way .
Example of a national drug information network
In country X , a national drug information network could combine institutions and resources such as :
• the Ministry of Health ( data on drug users in treatment , data on drug @-@ related infectious diseases )
• the Ministry of the Interior ( data on seizures , price , quality , drug @-@ related crime )
• the Inter @-@ Ministerial Drug Committee ( funding of NDO staff who coordinate the production of the national report and who ensure national reporting obligations are met )
• the World Bank or another international donor ( a general population survey and electronic data collection system on drugs users in treatment )
• other national organisations for some ad hoc surveys and / or qualitative studies among drug users • laboratories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences • the national drugs observatory in its role of coordinator of the whole network .
How to network ?
When possible , on the basis of the experts and institutions identified during the information map exercise , establish a national working group for each set of indicators and core data and for national reporting .
Encourage and help these groups to define achievable objectives with the existing resources in order to ensure a ( better ) monitoring of the drugs situation in your country .
Provide all national working groups with regular information about the activities and achievements of the other groups .
Organise a national meeting every year or every two years where you present and discuss with them the national report and the data reported .
Identify with them needs for improvements , perspectives for new or better data collection and any other ad hoc studies , and act as a facilitator for accessing information on possible sources of funding .
Conventions or agreements can help to formalise cooperation , but cannot replace partner motivation .
This is one of the network 's critical roles ( see Figure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
Basically , the network helps to define and then translate the NAPDIS into reality .
Figure 5 : The vital role of the national drug information network in the NAPDIS
Drug monitoring national reference framework
National drug information network
How to get there
What needs to be done
When creating a national drug information network :
• Present the missions of the NDO and the national drug information network : the ultimate goal is to meet national reporting obligations
• Try to be useful to them ( e.g. provide information on potential sources of funding , grant applications to international organisations , relevant international conferences )
• Try to arrange a meeting every 1 @-@ 2 years with your partners to share information , discuss the conclusions of your reports , and reflect about current trends .
In the European Union , best practice suggests having national working groups for fi ve key epidemiological indicators , national reporting and law enforcement indicators , when possible .
Quality of the data (
Quality assurance should be an integral part of a national action plan for a drugs information network , as long as it is realistic and takes into account available resources .
Quality control means checking quality of the data against a set standard or specification. cation .
Ensuring quality is a big challenge for an NDO and may be attained by organising or facilitating training activities for NDO staff and partners , and by defining a clear quality assurance process .
The NDO has a key role in raising awareness on this issue with partners and driving a consensus on concrete steps to take in order to improve the quality of data collected .
) Quality assurance is an organisation 's guarantee that the product or service it offers meets the accepted quality standards .
The NDO 's networking strategy may also help motivate data providers to deliver quality data and further address the issue of quality as part of the data collection process .
How can you control and improve data quality ?
Improving the quality of information on drug @-@ related issues following an initial identification of potential problems or shortcomings may be achieved by establishing new sources of information , or capacity building .
In this task , the NDO may choose to use methodological materials available from specialised
16 organisations , such as the EMCDDA , WHO , UNODC and others (
Following this process , provide your partners with a fi nal report , summarising the strengths and weaknesses of data quality , along with recommendations for changes and / or improvements .
TIPS FOR NDO BUILDING (
When developing quality assurance :
• Participate in working groups and other networking events
• Liaise with and / or take part in relevant international or regional expert meetings and subprojects on this issue
• Carry out a formal review of data quality and availability at national level with an expert panel • Compare results with international guidelines and standards
Remember that any progress in this area will depend on your capacity to build consensus !

How to analyse the information collected ?
The objective of this core function is to interpret and present heterogeneous data combining quantitative and qualitative information in order to give a comprehensive picture of the drugs situation .
This critical process should entail the following :
• working with quantitative data ; • analysing qualitative information ; • interpreting and putting together all sources of information .
More detailed information about statistical methods and about the specific protocols for data
1 collection can be found on the handbook 's online toolbox (
It is also important that staff keep a record of all of the information related to the data used for any reporting .
Common sources of quantitative drug data
Government records and registries
In most cases , these data are routinely collected .
Another important category of data collected by national drugs observatories will come from surveys organised either periodically or on ad hoc basis .
It is important to assess whether such studies are using international standardised protocols and methodologies .
Ad hoc studies can be surveys among specific groups of the population who are at high @-@ risk of drug use ( such as homeless people and prisoners ) or surveys on drug @-@ related infectious diseases , for instance .
A survey is used to describe a situation in a population at a given point in time .
Data collected in the area of " responses to the drug problem " may also fall within this group .
Time series studies represent a special case and are a very interesting source of information .
• cohort studies ( treatment cohorts , birth cohorts , special cohorts ) ; • repeated cross @-@ sectional series e.g. school surveys .
While the data collected through surveys or through government records allow for some kind of measurement , there are some areas or some aspects of the drugs situation that cannot be directly measured .
Importance of statistical metadata
" Metadata provides information on data - and about processes of producing and using data .
2 inform about " (
Metadata give us insight as to how data were collected , what they describe and refer to , and about the reliability and comparability of the information provided .
Metadata can help answer questions such as :
• What kind of study are we talking about : is it part of routine data collection ?
Is this study part of other sets of studies that are being compared , or is it a one @-@ off study ?
If data are routinely collected , what is their origin , how is the data collection organised ?
• Are data coming from ( a ) recognised government bodies , or ( b ) private / voluntary organisations , ( c ) universities and research centres ?
" Guidelines for the Modelling of Statistical Data and Metadata , " United Nations Statistical Commission and Economic Commission for Europe , United Nations , Geneva 1995 .
• Are the sources using standardised and systematic data collection procedures , or are the data collected serving other objectives ( e.g. treatment follow @-@ up vs police operations ) ?
• Do the sources have an official appraisal system for data quality assurance , have there been recent reviews of the procedures and quality , and are there formal reviews of data quality ?
Are these formal reviews available at national level ?
What do the data sources usually do to assess their own quality , how do they consider their figures ?
Were the studies or data published in a scientific journal or peer reviewed ?
Metadata are as important as the data themselves , and should be stored and kept updated by the national drugs observatory , under what is sometimes called the " statistical metadata system . "
How to assess quantitative data
We will briefly describe here four groups of criteria for the assessment of quantitative information : definitions , representativeness , validity and reliability .
A definition is a brief precise statement of what a word , question , measure or expression means .
The following questions may guide the NDO in this task :
• Are there standard definitions and are they uniformly applied geographically and temporally in the country ?
• Are the reported measurements clear and precise ( for instance not just " used cannabis " but " used cannabis 40 + times in lifetime " ) ?
• Is the period used to describe the prevalence consistent with standard protocols , and are the age groups defined in line with international standards ?
The conclusions need to be documented and included in the NDO 's data register .
When the NDO identifies problems on compatibility of definitions and their application with international standards and protocols , it should explore with the data providers the reasons for these discrepancies and try to find solutions .
A primary consideration for the NDO is whether the data collected is representative of the target population .
In relation to government statistics and registries , the issue is whether the registries cover the entire target population .
Where sampling has been employed , the method of sampling can determine whether the sample is representative of the target population , or some subset ( 3 ) .
Geographical coverage
Is the national coverage real or does it cover all regions but only to some extent ?
Is there information on local areas : city sizes , catchment areas , areas not covered , and can the geographic coverage provide subnational breakdowns ?
Is the sampling representative only at national level or does it meet the criteria for subnational areas ?
Population coverage
Are there known demographic peculiarities present in the data source ( e.g. minority groups ) ?
Changes in coverage
Do changes in coverage occur ?
Additional comments on sampling
The most common distinction between sampling methods is that between probabilistic ( simple random sampling , stratified random sampling ... or some mixture thereof ) and nonprobabilistic methods ( purposive sampling , snowball sampling ... ) .
Central to which probabilistic sampling method is employed is the availability or not of a coherent sample frame , or listing of the target population .
Probabilistic methods , correctly implemented , allow generalisations to be made to the population listed in the sample frame , with statements of sampling error in the form of confidence intervals .
Nonprobabilistic sampling is used when a researcher wants to explore an experience , investigate a phenomenon or develop a new theory .
If in principle the study findings are to be generalisable , it is necessary to ensure that the sample is representative .
This implies that it is important for the NDO to have access not just to the numbers generated but also to information on the sampling method used and implementation of the survey .
Validity
How can the validity of a study be assessed ?
When a study measures what it intended to measure it is valid .
Different disciplines may make reference to different types of validity , however with quantitative studies , what is important to ensure is that :
• the measure is relevant to the study population ; • the measure is relevant to the experts in the subject ;
• the attitude assessment of the survey population can predict or agree with constructs external to attitude ;
• the answers correlate with other related constructs in the anticipated manner .
Standard methodology texts can be referred to for definitions (
Are there any associated
See for example Carmines , E. G. and Zeller , R. A. ( 1979 ) , " Reliability and Validity Assessment , " Sage Publications , London .
While assessing the validity of the studies or surveys , special attention must be paid to possible biases , or non @-@ random or systematic errors , entering into the data .
Sources of bias may include sampling methods , question wording , and interview techniques .
This criterion relates to technical issues that may arise and that may have an impact on the study and bias the results .
For that purpose , please check :
• what was foreseen in case of non @-@ response : possible bias and assumptions if ignored
• what checks were done on non @-@ respondents ?
Was there any decision taken by the interviewers that may influence or affect the sampling method ?
Analysis methods
Complementary information should be available regarding :
• description of the analysis if appropriate ; • description of the statistical or qualitative software that was used .
Do the authors use recognised and known scales ?
How is their validity and consistency evaluated ?
How were the interviewers recruited ?
What was the relationship between interviewer and respondent ( formal , official , friend , student , private market research ) .
Who was present at the interview or during the questionnaire , and what was their status ( parent , school @-@ teacher , prescribing doctor , professional , or policeman ) ?
Length , self @-@ completion and confidentiality .
How is confidentiality guaranteed , and what are the chances that it is perceived as guaranteed ?
Indicators are approximate and often imperfect measures of the nature and extent of particular drug use @-@ related events or outcomes .
There is a need to systematically check the quality of data sources as a prerequisite for their selection within a system .
Quantity of data sources used does not in itself provide a more valid system .
Data sources reflect different aspects of the phenomenon .
When analysing routine quantitative datasets check :
When reading or designing a quantitative study , ask yourself and if needed check with your partners :

As already stated , the data provided to the NDO are often secondary .
This aggregated data makes direct statistical analysis impossible .
This can , of course , limit the NDO 's ability to make statistical comparisons between different groups or samples .
Analysing and interpreting quantitative data require a sound knowledge of statistical analysis and of the most commonly used statistical software .
The NDO is expected to use its statistical knowledge to assess the conclusions of the reports and surveys that it has received , and / or to conduct or contribute to the statistical analysis of primary data .
Scientific objectivity and independence are essential conditions for the legitimacy and credibility of the work of the NDO and its partners - any compromise would undermine the viability of the whole system .
How to analyse qualitative information ?
How to make a correct interpretation ?
Qualitative data used by an NDO usually originate from two different sources : contextual information from key informants and formal qualitative research studies .
Such wide @-@ ranging information requires more flexible tools and periodicity for collection than is the case for quantitative data .
For instance , it can be collected by using structured or semi @-@ structured questionnaires .
This data can take the form of expert surveys , identifying and requesting information for those in the field with direct experience of the topic of interest .
Qualitative research gives us an opportunity to make sense of quantitative information , by further exploring :
• the social context ; • the social meaning of behaviour , and ; • behaviour as part of a wider social dynamic .
Within the arena of drug use , qualitative research has proved to be essential for :
• interpreting statistical data and placing it in context ; • providing insight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug @-@ using patterns ; • assessing the context in which interventions may be more effective ; and • helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interventions ; • understanding new drug using phenomena ; • providing insight into drugs markets .
The NDO plays an important role in making an inventory of such research results in its country , and in integrating these results in its analysis and reports .
It can also identify the areas where additional qualitative research is needed , and launch a joint project with its partners if resources are available .
NDOs frequently face a situation in which they receive some limited quantitative information that is not sufficient per se to draw a clear and correct conclusion .
In such circumstances , a combination of both quantitative and qualitative information can help them to build a more accurate or more comprehensive picture of the situation concerned .
While putting data into context , look for complementary information , for instance :

How to assess the quality of qualitative studies
Qualitative research is characterised by a wide range of approaches and data collection techniques , and determining how to judge the quality of a qualitative study will depend on the approach adopted .
Efforts have been made to develop criteria within qualitative research which are accepted broadly as replacements for what quantitative researchers call validity and reliability .
The strength of qualitative research is that it addresses the relationship between the researcher and the research object , precluding the notion of a common truth .
However , there are a few common aspects that should be considered :
• Did the authors define a clearly formulated statement of the objectives of the research and what specific question it addressed ?
• Was a qualitative approach appropriate ?
• How were the settings and the subjects selected ?
Generally , qualitative studies are not interested in an " average " - they gain an understanding of the experience of particular groups or individuals .
In any case , we need to understand how the sample was selected in order to understand the results and in order to draw conclusions .
• What methods were used and are these described in detail ?
Describing methods is not an easy task in qualitative research but you should be able to assess whether the methods were a sensible and adequate way of addressing the research question .
• What methods were used to analyse the data ?
There are a broad range of qualitative methods , each with their own specific methodological perspective .
• Was attention given to the reliability of inter @-@ observers and to the validity of findings ?
For example , were the streetworkers involved in the interviews given training or a handbook ?
• Are the results credible ?
What conclusions were drawn and are they justified by the results ?
Do the results meet expectations or are they contradictory :
• - with other parts of the study ; • - with the results of other studies performed in the same environment ?
When the information is based on key informants , the following issues deserve careful attention :
• What was the key informant 's perspective ?
The information from key informants is never unbiased ; it is influenced by their position , their personal , political , or cultural interests : what is their motivation ?
• Was there more than one key informant chosen ( i.e. expert panel ) ?
How were they selected ?
• Key informants should be encouraged to disclose any specific interests that might influence their impartiality .
When considering a qualitative study ...
• What are the study objectives ?
• What type of study is it ( simple thematic analysis , action research , grounded theory , phenomenology , ethnography or other ) ?
• Does the author ( s ) reveal his / her view point ( s ) and discuss how his / her view point ( s ) may affect the study ?
• Who authored and who reviewed the study ?
• Who published the study ? Peer review journal , research institution or other ?
When using information provided by key informants ...
• What is the perspective and motivation of the key informants ? • How were key informants selected ?
Analyses of trends in the wider context
6 working @-@ day and seasonal variation from a time series (
The social , demographic , economical or political context may be used to explain related indicator data and / or trends .
Some examples are :
• socio @-@ demographic characteristics ( i.e. unemployment rate ) ;
• developments in the music culture ( increase in popularity of music cultures that are associated with drug consumption ) ;
• public health expenditure and priorities ( public expenditure or changes in the number of treatment units ) ;
• immigration / ethnicity ( i.e. emergence of new drug use patterns among immigrants that may affect local supply ) ;
• tourism ( i.e. emergence of new drugs on the local market due to demand among tourists ) .
Such studies can be used as additional sources of information , keeping in mind that the results cannot simply be transferred to other populations .
Analyses of trends : errors , threats , and risk
Reliability and validity challenges for drug trend monitoring systems or potential for error , lie in two broad areas : at the level of individual sources and at the whole system level .
A type 1 error means finding something that is not there would involve identifying a trend that does not exist .
A type 2 error - missing something that is there - would involve a system failing to identify a new drug trend ( 7 ) .
Identification of a nonexistent trend ( type 1 error or false positives ) : Type 1 errors can be linked to data collection , analysis or reporting errors .
Creating a new trend is the ultimate risk here .
Failing to identify a trend ( type 2 error or false negatives ) : Type 2 errors , or failing to identify and report a new trend might be the result of poor data choice , or poor analysis techniques .
For example an over reliance on slow reporting methods is likely to lead to late reporting of a trend .
There is a specific risk that systems will miss emerging drug trends by not asking appropriate research questions .
Slow developing trends are vulnerable here - very slight but continuous increases or decreases in consumption might never reach the reporting threshold , but in the longer term do constitute a significant change .
Analyses of the relationship between different indicators
As mentioned before , an appraisal of the data quality for the indicators is of crucial importance .
The cross @-@ references made in the national report are there to present possible relationships between indicators taking into account other influences and biases .
Mixed methods
A number of researchers have argued in favour of the use of mixed methods for drug trend
Mixed methods sampling strategies involve the selection of units for a research study using both probability sampling ( to increase external validity ) and purposive sampling strategies ( to increase transferability ) .
Use of mixed methods requires attendance to bias checking procedures for each method .
10 detailed description and triangulation (
Reporting and communicating should be seen as a critical function of the national drugs observatory , even if they are the result of a long process .
Ultimately , producing and disseminating outputs underpin the NDO 's existence , as its outputs substantiate its visibility both nationally and internationally .
To ensure sustainability and " buy @-@ in , " it is vital that the NDO ensures that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stakeholders and audiences - both at national and supranational level .
In the long run , a failure to build visibility and to demonstrate the added value of the NDO will automatically have a negative impact on its credibility .
What should NDO outputs contain ?
The objective is to use the results of data analysis and interpretation to answer stakeholder questions .
This means that reports must be tailored in terms of content and format to the needs of the NDO 's stakeholders , or " clients . "
To reach this objective , the NDO needs to :
• make the added value of its outputs a priority ;
• know its stakeholders and assess their needs ;
• go beyond the sole description of the past or present situation ;
• comply with international reporting procedures ;
• develop a strategy for communication and dissemination .
How to report at national level ?
This is one aspect of the NDO 's reporting that may sometimes be underestimated , for instance when the focus of its work , or of its mandate , is to meet national reporting obligations of supranational or international organisations .
The reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stakeholders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its format , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
This means that ideally , for each output being produced , the NDO should define its objective , identify the target group , and select the relevant format .
The drafting process can only start after this preliminary analysis .
The challenge for the NDO is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that customers are satisfied .
This is no easy task .
Information may be either complementary or divergent ; for example , there may be a trade @-@ off when balancing national needs and international reporting obligations .
Moreover , information needs may also be unclear or unknown .
It is difficult , for example , to assess ex ante the information needs of customers of public services .
Instead , it should be possible to use participative techniques such as focus groups with subgroups of end @-@ users to assess in detail the relevance of specific outputs .
The danger for the NDO would be to decide without consultation what its audience needs , both in terms of content and of format .
It needs to ask those concerned what their needs are .
However , the NDO does have a role to propose outputs and issues that may be of interest to the community : it must be proactive .
Objections may be raised that it is not within the NDO 's mandate to make such proposals , nor to take initiatives .
When planning outputs and publications , the work of the NDO and its partners should combine :
• An assessment of the information needs of its stakeholders at national level , through regular dialogue with its direct " clients , " for instance by asking their feedback about their products
• A contribution to building common understanding of the national drugs situation between experts and for stakeholders .
To whom should we report at national level ?
What for ?
The NDO 's potential stakeholders and potential clients are decision @-@ makers , professionals working in the drugs field , the scientifi c community and the general public .
Together they must be considered as customers for the NDO 's outputs .
Once the stakeholders have been identified , it is necessary for the NDO to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
We would suggest the NDO classifies stakeholders in the following order of importance (
Decisionmakers
Decision @-@ makers , and more generally those who are sponsoring the NDO either directly or indirectly ; government and parliament representatives ; drug coordinators and officials responsible for implementing drug policy ; local government officials. cials .
Their decision has an impact on the existence of the national drugs observatory and on the investment in the national drugs information network .
They need highly summarised , objective information on the national drugs situation in an international context and on drugs @-@ related issues of national interest .
More detailed information should be available upon request .
Type of output needed
Clear , short and simple information , always in the national language ( s ) and sometimes provided at short notice .
Professionals working in the drugs field : treatment centres ; prevention and educational specialists ; outreach workers , but also law enforcement professionals .
They are the NDO 's key partners and data providers ; they need to be motivated for maintaining or even increasing their contribution , and they should gain some benefit for their efforts .
Their potential needs cover a broad range of information : external sources of funding for training and training materials , grants , etc . ; national drugs situation in an international context ; international standards and methodological tools in their respective field of activity .
The information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
Two additional groups could also be added to the list of stakeholders , although they are usually not the primary target for the NDO 's communication and dissemination strategy .
However , it might be considered useful if the NDO could utilise information or data already produced for other purposes for the benefit of these two groups ;
Researchers
These are researchers in the drugs field : university researchers and scientific staff ; research institutes ; field researchers in NGOs .
Their work represents a significant part of the information being produced at national level , either to illustrate the issue or to understand the rationale behind behaviours and attitudes .
An NDO contribution to their work could either be in the form of providing information or contributing to the dissemination of their research results .
The information should be comprehensive , very detailed and easily accessible .
This covers in particular those directly or indirectly confronted with the drugs issue : students , young people , drug users and their families .
Making clear and understandable information available to the general public is part of their fundamental rights : it is also an obligation for organisations that are being established with public money .
Is my child going to be affected ?
Where can I go for help ?
The information should be clear , concise , presented in simple terms , avoid sensationalism and provide citizens with concrete solutions for seeking help or advice in their own language .
Figure 6 : Matrix of information needs showing content and format
Format , level of detail
Following such analysis , the national drugs observatory can then assess :
• the appearance and nature of NDO products and deliverables needed at national level , and
• how to use and format the results of data analysis and interpretation to match the needs of its different users .
The same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the format and content needs identified in the matrix .
Know your national stakeholders and assess their needs :
Summarised information on specific issues , topics of interest : e.g. policy briefings , executive summary of national reports .
Professionals from the drugs fi eld
Information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues , structured and well documented contents , in a not @-@ too @-@ detailed format ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a compilation of documents ) .
Very detailed information , including raw data , on specific topics , allowing them to make their own analysis and interpretation .
Why differentiate between analysis and reporting ?
Are they not part of the same process ?
Within the limits of its mandate , the NDO needs to explore how it can make its work and products more useful and more relevant for its national audience .
There are two complementary ways to achieve this - by going beyond a simple descriptive reporting approach , and by tailoring the products to audience needs .
Producing a report that goes beyond a simple description of the situation can be done either by being proactive or by using the information available in a more creative manner :
How can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them ? "
In the first approach , additional information identified by the NDO may be needed , which may mean deciding how to obtain or produce the missing information .
This will then become a new project for the NDO and its partners .
A complementary approach can be to correlate the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level .
When the NDO produces reports and other outputs , it should always be able to answer the ... " so what ? " question .
This leaves the reader asking " so what ? "
Every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @-@ defined. ned .
Make information relevant to national stakeholders :
• Further explore how to make the information collected useful and visible
• Be prospective : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and perspectives , or new risks
• Be creative : what else can you do with the data gathered ?
Don 't just be descriptive - present conclusions .
Reporting to these organisations is somewhat easier insofar as the expected format and contents are given .
There are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
This is what we will describe briefly , starting with the UN reporting system , which is used worldwide .
United Nations reporting system
The UN reporting system is managed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) .
" Under the International Drug Control Treaties , Member States are formally required to provide annually information on the working of the international drug control treaties .
For more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports Questionnaires ( ARQ ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
" Review of the data collection process and preparatory activities for the development of a new annual report questionnaire .
Revision of the mechanism for collecting and reporting information , " Meeting of the expert group on data collection , Vienna , 12 @-@ 15 January 2010 .
The ARQ , which is currently under revision , is the cornerstone of the international data collection on drugs that informs UNODC 's global drug situation analyses and reporting .
The Commission on Narcotic Drugs ( CND ) : is the central policymaking body of the United Nations in drug @-@ related matters .
Inter @-@ American Observatory on Drugs ( OID ) .
Data collection takes place through two primary systems :
Each of the protocols are standardised with the goal of producing information that is comparable across countries .
• The CICDAT system to collect statistics on drug supply control ( uniform statistical system on control of the supply area ) .
In addition , CICAD carries out a tri @-@ annual evaluation process , known as the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism ( MEM ) .
The MEM is a peer review process in which the Member States evaluate each other on the progress of actions taken to combat the hemispheric drug problem .
The information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comprise the MEM Instrument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
In addition to fulfilling the MEM instrument each country prepares an introductory narrative document to contextualise the information provided in the instrument .
The EMCDDA national reporting package has three elements : a national report , statistical tables and structured questionnaires .
• they are used to build a European picture , to analyse the situation and the evolution of the phenomenon and responses ;
International monitoring systems - common challenges
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quantity and quality of the information provided by their respective Member States - this information needs to be accurate , provided on time , and reliable ;
• evaluation is generally separated from data collection , but data collection is essential to feed the evaluation process , which in turn feeds into decision @-@ making .
At this stage , two tasks are of crucial importance :
When reporting to or for a supranational or international organisation :
• Clarify the process for delivery and identify the end benefi ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national coordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs coordinating body , etc . )
• Defi ne beforehand a scientifi c and institutional validation process ( scientifi c committee , peer review , etc . )
• Make sure you provide the data and other national reporting packages on time
• Be factual and neutral , do not exceed your role : the NDO 's credibility relies on its objectivity , not the political opinions of its staff
• Ensure that the information sent out has been appropriately validated .
Integrating dissemination into a communication strategy
After a needs analysis comes the time for choices , according to the NDO 's mandate and its available resources .
This is why it is important to draw a stakeholder strategy taking into account NDO resources , the availability of data and priorities .
Indeed , the long @-@ term challenge for the NDO is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that its various " clients " are satisfied. ed .
How to organise communication with the media
In relation to communication and dissemination , particular attention should be paid to a special group of customers : media professionals .
The next step is to consider whether the NDO 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
However , in the 21 century , communication cannot be reduced to whether this happens with or without the media .
A more appropriate question would be " how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observatory 's communication strategy , within the limits of its remit ? "
This does not prevent the head of the NDO answering requests for information from journalists , but the internal procedure could imply liaising with the press relations officer of the host institution .
In countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
When the NDO is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confidential note to the national drug coordinating body ( NDC ) - if relevant - or transmits the information through the normal channels .
The main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming " hot " topics .
The NDC usually transmits the report to its own communication department .
The information , press release ( s ) and various information packages are then placed on the Internet and the websites of the two institutions involved .
When relevant , the national drug coordinating body may decide to include the information in a national advertising campaign .

Working with media professionals
Providing correct information to decisionmakers and the general public relies on quality information disseminated by the media : incorrect information or a wrong interpretation of a given situation can have major ( negative ) consequences .

Communicating on drugs is difficult , because the topic is a passionate and emotional one .
None of the above are conducive to well @-@ developed and balanced articles .
The frenzied search for the latest " scoop " can lead to mistakes , as shown in the box below .
Most frequent mistakes found in the media about drugs

When communicating with the media (
• Keep scientifi c information and political messages separate • Identify a " press contact " for internal transparency
• Any person contacted by a journalist must refer the request to the NDO 's communication department ( or to the public relations officer if no such department )
• Ensure that the fi gures that are being communicated are appropriate for release to the general public

In this chapter , we propose some tools for making a strategic diagnosis of the NDO with reference to its institutional challenges , bearing in mind that each situation is unique .
Our approach will focus on three key strategic factors ( KSFs ) to be considered in order to ensure the NDO 's sustainability .
Institutional issues are only one of the challenges faced by an NDO : the core operations are what give the substance and legitimacy of the work of national drugs observatories .
These were presented in detail in the previous chapter .
The diagnosis should ideally be based on facts and figures .
Definition
A key strategic factor defines a structural characteristic of the organisation and of its
1 ) : environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
" We invented the term " strategic factors " to cover items not previously identified separately .
Strategic factors describe those few things that an organisation or business unit has to get right in
2 order to succeed with its key stakeholders " (
As NDOs are usually established within public institutions or with public funds , for the purpose of our analysis we will use methodological tools and concepts developed to study strategic management in public services .
See : http : / / www.strategicfactors.com / Kenny , G. , " Stakeholders and Strategic Management , " presented at the US Academy of Management Conference , Atlanta 11 @-@ 16 August , 2006 .
We refer in particular to a study published by Alford in 2001 , in which he presents a few characteristics that can apply to NDOs ( we italicise ) :
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @-@ production ) " ( 3 ) .
As far as the situation of the NDO is concerned , we observe that :
• NDO production depends on its cooperation with other national sources of information and of expertise , in most of the cases it cannot work on its own ( co @-@ production )
• the NDO builds its capacity on the basis of diverse resources and partners , at national , local and supranational level ( combined resources )
• these key factors are interconnected and inter @-@ dependent .
Based on the above , we propose considering the following as key strategic factors for the strategic diagnosis of a national drugs observatory : perceived value , co @-@ production and combined resources .
The NDO 's position in terms of these strategic factors must be assessed :
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clarify the mandate for its establishment ;
• at any time during the NDO 's existence to assess its situation and take appropriate measures to ensure its sustainability .
KSF 1 - Perceived added value
Bearing in mind the NDO 's situation , we can say that :
• the value of its work is quite complex to assess , as it is a response to a political decision that affects the country as a whole , including reporting obligations ;
• the value of the NDO 's work is not always measurable - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and outputs ;
• the value of the NDO 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
• most importantly , even if the NDO was established to meet some international obligations , if cannot fulfil its role if it does not answer national needs .
At this point , try not to think in one dimension .
To conclude : try to identify and define the NDO 's perceived or potential added value from the point of view of its audience / stakeholders , rather than from one of its promoters ( see box below ) .
What are you doing ? , " when asked by a decision @-@ maker :
( the famous " elevator pitch " can be a good way of preparing for this situation , or think of the " so what ? " we talked about earlier ) ;
• use vague administrative or scientific terms , such as
Note : an " elevator pitch " ( or elevator speech ) is an overview of an idea for a product , service , or project .
The name reflects the fact that an elevator pitch can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 50 @-@ 100 words ) .
To support the perceived value of the NDO , we propose using three categories of criteria to identify additional actions / measures : added value of NDO 's products , credibility , and relations with its audiences and stakeholders .
Figure 8 : KSF 1 - Perceived added value
Added value of the NDO 's products
Relations with audiences and stakeholders
Added value of the NDO 's products
Outputs : Is the NDO producing only one report per year ?
What is its content and format ?
Is this report published in the national language ( s ) and is it disseminated at national level ?
Is the NDO producing more targeted products for well identified groups or subgroups of " clients " ?
Are the NDO 's products published only for a specific purpose or are there complementary publications targeting non @-@ specialised audiences ?
Quality : Are the NDO 's reports considered good quality ?
Are the NDO 's products perceived as easy to understand by decisionmakers and the general public ?
Is the general image of NDO 's publications more of a scientific authority or is it perceived as being influenced by political or ideological considerations ?
Visibility : How would you assess the NDO 's visibility ?
Do the main existing or potential stakeholders know about its existence and do they know what they can ask the NDO ?
Is the NDO considered as the main or one of the main references for drug @-@ related information in the country ?
General and ad hoc requests : does anybody ask the NDO for standard or ad hoc requests ?
Is the NDO promoting itself as the reference organisation that can tailor information according to the needs of its customers ?
Relations with audience ( s ) and stakeholder ( s )
Promotion : does the NDO have established formal / informal relations with its audience / stakeholders ?
Is the NDO trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
Is there any policy within the NDO to identify existing or potential needs for drug @-@ related information among its audiences and its stakeholders ?
Media relations : how would you characterise the NDO 's relations with the media ?
Does the NDO have a public relations ( PR ) policy and a PR officer ?
Can the NDO communicate directly with media ?
Do newspapers and journalists know the NDO exists and do they refer to its reports and publications ?
Do they spontaneously contact the NDO when they need some information on the drugs issue in the country or abroad ?
KSF 2 - Co @-@ production
What does co @-@ production , or " collaborative production " mean for an NDO ?
It means that the NDO usually depends on existing sources of information and expertise available in the country to produce its own deliverables .
In fact , in many cases , most of the NDO 's products are the result of partnerships and cooperation , and external expertise may be needed also to validate its analyses and reports .
To be involved almost permanently in a co @-@ production process has very important consequences when organising the NDO 's work .
• establish a partnership with existing sources of information and national experts , both for data collection purposes and for developing reporting capacity ;
• ensure that its partners derive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system : it is important partners are motivated to provide the data , as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected ;
• realise that national monitoring capacity is the combination of different resources rather than their concentration ;
• take into account the fact that competences and responsibilities are increasingly being transferred from central to regional or local level in many countries .
This creates a greater need for convergence between co @-@ production activities .
To support assessing the NDO 's situation in terms of co @-@ production , we propose considering three categories of criteria for diagnosis : operating framework , reporting procedures and outputs .
Operating framework
Operating framework
Information map : is an information map drafted and permanently updated so as to identify any source of expertise and information available in the country , and is there any communication policy geared towards the strategic partners ?
Established partnerships : describes the NDO 's operating framework with the key sources of expertise and information in the country .
Is there a formal partnership agreement between the main data providers and the NDO ?
Relations with data providers : does the NDO have regular meetings with its data providers ?
Are the data providers informed about the events / decisions / activities organised by the NDO at national or at supranational level ?
Are there provisions for sharing the results of the cooperation ?
National reports : does the NDO draft its report ( s ) alone or in consultation / cooperation with national experts ?
Are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confrontation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
National working groups : are national working groups of experts established for relevant groups of indicators and for national reporting ?
Do these working groups meet regularly and try to improve the instruments and also data clarity ?
Is any feedback given to the institutions and professionals collecting the information in the field ?
Content : do contents of reports and other publications reflect the need for a multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
Do the NDO 's projects and outputs give a balanced view of the drugs phenomenon , addressing both demand and supply issues ?
Quality assurance : is there shared responsibility for quality assurance and quality control ?
Are there any quality control procedures before a report is published ?
Mutual benefits : is the NDO completely isolated ?
Are there institutions challenging or even contesting its legitimacy ?
Does the NDO acknowledge the value and competences of other institutions already working in the field ?
Do partnerships offer mutual benefit to the institutions involved ?
Is the NDO playing a role in the exploitation and promotion of existing resources at local and at national level ?
Is the NDO managing to provide something useful to its partners in exchange for their data and / or expertise ?
KSF 3 - Combined resources
Human and financial resources are frequently presented as the starting point for any project .
Here again , we suggest being less self @-@ focused .
The main priority for the promoter or NDO head is undoubtedly funds and human resources .
This means he / she will tend to promote the " institution . "
However , those contacted for funds need to see why they should give money to an NDO instead of something else .
This means promoting the " expected results and benefits " in any written or spoken proposal .
There is also a more empirical reason for this approach .
NDOs are not created out of thin air in a vacuum .
There are already at least some institutions and professionals on the field who have information , data and / or expertise on the drugs phenomenon .
There are three underlying principles that support this approach :
• more can always be achieved when resources are pooled ;
The NDO can only receive or benefit from other partners " resources if it turns itself into a resource for them .
To describe this KSF , a broader range of topics than just the NDO 's budget should be considered .
This is why we propose three categories : institutional support , operational capacity , scientific capacity .
Figure 10 : KSF 3 - Combined resources
NDO mandate and status : do politicians and other decisionmakers fully support the project to set up an NDO ?
Is there any binding resolution from the national authorities on their own or in relation to any supranational organisation that supports setting up the NDO and the national data collection network ?
Reporting and status of NDO products : has a mechanism for evaluating the work of the NDO and its outputs been foreseen ?
Is the NDO expected to provide decisionmakers with
Does the work of the NDO contribute to national reporting obligations ?
Does the NDO have a specific and explicit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy ?
Staff and budget : is there a specific budget adopted on a yearly basis or an ad hoc non @-@ recurrent funding for specific activities ?
Is the mission and work of the NDO described in a yearly work programme with staff assigned exclusively to the NDO on a full @-@ time basis ?
Does the NDO have a strategy to liaise with national authorities to maintain or increase the level of investment in the drug @-@ related data collection system ?
Networking and partnerships : is there any national expertise that could complement the expertise available at the NDO , and if so is there any formal mechanism or project to facilitate cooperation with the experts concerned ?
Budget for routine and ad hoc data collection : are budgets available in other institutions and ministries for routine data collection ?
Is there any specific or general programme at state level that includes a provision for commissioning ad hoc studies , research or surveys to which the NDO can apply ?
Does the country cooperate with - and have access to - funding from international or supranational organisations such as the EU , UNODC , WHO , OAS , CARICOM or the Global Fund ?
Data and information : are there any drug @-@ related data that are routinely collected at national or local level ?
Are there plans for new routine data collection that would totally or partially meet international standards ?
What is the feasibility and likelihood to prepare and present new projects for routine data collection ?
What are the obstacles and what are the possible solutions ( financial , methodological , etc . ) ?
Are the main groups of indicators and other sets of core data available in the country ?
What are the realistic perspectives for an improvement of the situation ?
Is there anything that can be done at a reasonable cost to prepare their implementation ?
Scientific and professional expertise : are there any drug @-@ related research activities in the country that could provide some information on the drugs situation , or that could benefit from the support and cooperation with the NDO ?
Building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evaluations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
This becomes a sound base for preparing a strategic plan for the development of the national drugs observatory .
A strategic plan aims to make sure that the NDO will consolidate or improve its situation and will maximise its position as regards the three key strategic factors , which could be summarised as follows :
• to ensure more perceived added value from its stakeholders at national and at local level ;
• to improve and to diversify the co @-@ production scheme so as to produce better products which are tailored to the needs of its different client groups ;
• to better combine the resources from national and local level , both in terms of data and of expertise , so as to consolidate the co @-@ production processes and the quality of publications and other outputs .
The analytical framework proposed is dynamic and flexible : there is no single model for NDOs that should be applied indistinctly to any country and to any situation .
What matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
In the current context of general socio @-@ economic difficulties , one should avoid the temptation of presenting exaggerated objectives and excessive requests for funding .
These will not only be refused by the decision @-@ makers , but will also give the NDO and its promoters a negative image that might prove fatal for the organisation 's survival .
However , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the choices to be made .
Indeed , the strategic diagnosis and the strategic plan are tools that support decision @-@ making at NDO and stakeholder level : the better the information , the easier the decision @-@ making process .
However , these tools are based on a pre @-@ requisite : DO think about what you can already do with what you and your partners have , DON 'T say " I cannot do anything until I get more . "

The table above gives an overview of the NDO and its national drug information network 's main goals .
It should be prepared on the basis of objective and reliable information , ensuring balance and giving links between the three key strategic factors .
Where should the national drugs observatory be located ?
What legal status should it have ?
What should the scope of its mandate be ?
In this chapter we will present and provide some elements of response to common questions frequently asked about national drugs observatories , and to which there is usually no single answer .
If you have more , please e @-@ mail your question to the EMCDDA or CICAD at : info @ emcdda.europa.eu and OID _ CICAD @ oas.org.
Options for consideration
This depends on how decision @-@ making is organised in your country .
Here are examples of existing situations :
• within national drug coordination bodies or under government departments ; • within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health ; • within the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security ; • within a university or a non @-@ governmental organisation .
Strengths and weaknesses
However , if too close politically , the NDO 's scientific credibility and objectivity and even long @-@ term stability may be challenged .
If the NDO is located within or under the Ministry of Health , this is usually very beneficial when collecting data on health and social issues , but less effective for supply and supply reduction data .
The capacity of developing a comprehensive analysis of the drugs situation ( = beyond specific public health issues ) is not always guaranteed .
It is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the supply side .
If the NDO is located within or under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security , this offers more opportunities to obtain data on supply
Building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook and supply reduction , but less on social and health issues .
The capacity of developing a comprehensive analysis of the drugs situation ( = beyond specific law enforcement competence ) is not always guaranteed .
It is important to ensure that cooperation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side .
However , sometimes the NDO remains too far from decision @-@ makers , lacks visibility and institutional support of its role at national level .
Most of the existing national drugs observatories have the following in common :
• their work is defined by some terms of reference , either as a single entity or as a unit / section within a bigger institution .
If the NDO is established at a too low structural and hierarchical level within an existing institution , this presents the same disadvantages and also gives no visibility to the NDO and its products .
It then becomes extremely difficult for the NDO to fulfil its mandate and address the needs of its stakeholders at national level .
This can serve as a basis for assessing its performance at the end of the period .
The latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
The legal status can be extremely useful to formalise the inter @-@ institutional and interagency cooperation as it " obliges " third parties to respect and recognise the NDO 's role .
The following two options should be considered :
• limiting the scope of the NDO 's work to illicit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of supranational and international organisations such the EMCDDA and UNODC ;
If the NDO 's scope is extended to licit substances , this gives an excellent opportunity to build a comprehensive image of complex social and individual behaviours linked to addiction .
It can also provide the opportunity to observe and analyse possible correlations between
Building a national drugs observatory : a joint handbook trends of use .
However , this also makes the work of the NDO more complex , both from an organisational and scientific perspective .
If the objectives and expected results are realistically and clearly defined , whatever the scope of the NDO 's mandate , all work must be productive and relevant .
In all situations , the resources that the NDO is allocated to do its job must be consistent with the scope of its mandate .
To address this issue , one should consider the following :
• The national drugs observatory 's technical competence should ideally mirror the wide range of subject areas covered by its scope and mandate ;
• The technical and scientific know @-@ how of the NDO and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• Scientific background : the team in the NDO should have the necessary skills to cover all aspects of the monitoring and reporting framework .
Main profiles could therefore include : epidemiologist , sociologist , psychologist or other social scientist , toxicologist , statistician , criminologist and policy analyst ;
• Managerial and communication skills : general management , communication and networking , editing and dissemination as well as secretarial support are all likely to be needed ;
• At least half of the staff should have a certain degree of professional experience and preferably clear scientific qualifications .
• The NDO needs to attract and to keep competent staff , and it needs to be stable so as to ensure both its scientific capacity and the quality of its processes and deliveries ;
• Each country should find the structure and organisation that matches best with supranational and international reporting tasks and the national context ;
• Some countries with very limited resources have no choice but to start with one person .
If the NDO is a rather small unit , this should be compensated with formal agreements for the secondment of the missing scientific resources .
1 number of staff falls under three full @-@ time posts or their equivalent (
) , the NDO cannot fulfil its tasks .
If the NDO is established as a small unit , it often tends to rely too heavily on external expertise and sometimes poorly @-@ organised national networks .
With a team that is too small , management and networking activities that are critical for the NDO become a real challenge .
If the NDO is given an important national mandate as an observatory , this implies that the competences required need to cover the full range of core functions as described in Chapters 3 to 5 .
If this is the case , special attention must be paid to institutional relations and cooperation , and to communication and public relations .
In order to provide policymakers with a comprehensive picture of the budgetary and financial implications involved in setting up an NDO , the national drugs observatory and national drugs information network must be considered together .
The estimated cost should be based on an assessment of the following criteria :
• The running costs of the NDO in terms of staff and operations , including meetings with national and international partners ;
• Specific costs associated to the mission and tasks of the NDO , spread along the three key operating processes : data collection , analysis and interpretation , reports and publications ;
• In some cases it may be relevant to make a distinction between costs for national and international obligations ;
• It may be necessary to draft financial plans that set yearly running costs .
However , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the NDO will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
This means that the budget can be more limited for the first year of activity .
However , budgetary objectives for years two and three should be considered , at least as a reasonable perspective ( 2 ) ;
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the NDO 's capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds .
This means that either in the NDO or its host institution there must be someone with sound administrative and financial management skills ;
This means that some may be working in different institutions and seconded to the NDO.When the NDO is based within a public body , budgetary perspectives and commitments usually cannot exceed one year .
A sudden change or imbalance in the NDO 's finances during an operational year is extremely damageable to both the NDO and its network .
This may also affect the delivery of the outputs to supranational and international organisations , which may have negative consequences for the country 's reputation .
When this issue is discussed , avoid confusion between " scientific quality , " and " institutional autonomy , " which are two different things .
• Scientific quality is extremely important to ensure that the data are correctly presented and interpreted , that they are true and trustworthy , and that they meet international standards .
The objective of this review is to ensure that there are neither mistakes nor any misinterpretation of the data , and to validate the publication .
This in turn gives more legitimacy to the NDO .
There should be no compromise on the quality of the NDO 's outputs .
• Institutional autonomy refers to something different : the NDO should be preserved from external attempts to transform data , give false information , encourage propaganda or political correctness .
The NDO is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics .
At the same time , the NDO must define and to keep a position in relation to other institutions or key actors in the country .
A situation where the scientific quality of the NDO 's work is tainted is unacceptable .
Despite possible attempts to disguise interference , it is usually detected by international organisations .
This is harmful for the reputation of the country concerned .
If the NDO is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
As already mentioned , the NDO needs to pay special attention to avoid crossing institutional and competence boundaries .
National drugs observatories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies , at the request of their respective national authorities .
However , to make this possible and relevant , a few principles need to be respected :
• there should be an official request addressed to the NDO by its national authority , indicating the scope and the objectives of the evaluation ;
The same applies to the expertise needed to conduct the evaluation ;
• the NDO should reserve the right to accept - or to propose a technical modification in order to accept - to perform the evaluation ;
• the NDO 's contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds ( factual , neutral , objective , reliable ) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the remit of national authorities ;
• the NDO should clarify what are the questions of the evaluation for which there is no evidence available .
When the scope of the work carried out by the NDO within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the NDO .
However there have been situations in which despite these precautions , some political actors have accused the NDO of a lack of objectivity and of being " politically oriented " - if not , providing " false " data .
This is why all of the NDO 's actions linked to any evaluation must be scientifically sound and well documented .
International assistance , provided either during the evaluation , for instance in a scientific steering committee or for a peer review may also help counter such potential negative reactions .
It usually also helps to better define objectives , and to better identify existing and new data needed for measuring the performance or the impact of some measures .
What comes next ?
How can we translate theory into practice ?
Through the different chapters and sections of this handbook , the reader has been given a comprehensive presentation of national drugs observatories , in particular :
• a clear definition of what is an observatory , its mission and objectives ;
• a detailed presentation of its three core functions which are : data collection and monitoring ; data analysis and interpretation ; reporting and dissemination ;
• an introduction to strategic diagnosis based on three key strategic factors ( KSFs ) and their related criteria - perceived added value , co @-@ production and combined resources ;
• and finally , a suggestion of some options to be considered when setting up a national drugs observatory , with the main strengths and weaknesses of each option .
The time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice .
As you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
Taking on board the ideas , concepts and experiences that have been shared with you in this handbook , you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observatory should be like .
One last suggestion : use the processes and expected outputs as a starting point and build a system and a network around them .
There are no institutional models to be copied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

About the EMCDDA
About CICAD @-@ OAS
The Inter @-@ American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( CICAD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1986 as the western hemisphere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is the hub of drug @-@ related information in Europe .
Its mission is to provide the EU and its Member States with " factual , objective , reliable and comparable information " on drugs , drug addiction and their consequences .
Established in 1993 , it opened its doors in Lisbon in 1995 and is one of the EU 's decentralised agencies .
With a 100 @-@ strong multidisciplinary team , the agency offers policymakers the evidence base they need for drawing up drug laws and strategies .
It also helps professionals and researchers pinpoint best practice and new areas for analysis .
As well as gathering information on the demand and reduction of the demand for drugs , the agency in recent years has extended its monitoring and reporting on drug supply , supply reduction and illicit drug markets .
Data collection in the CICAD system takes place within the context of the Inter @-@ American Observatory on Drugs ( OID ) .
Overview
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is the hub of drug @-@ related information in the European Union .
Alsoserved are professionals and researchers working in the drugs field and , more broadly , the European media and general public .
One of the agency 's key aims is to render drug information more comparableacross Europe .
This allows countries to gauge how they fit into the wider European picture and examine common problems and responses to drugs .
The EMCDDA works on the assumption that sound information is the key toan effective strategy on drugs .
Although the Centre cannot propose any kindof policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @-@ making throughits analyses , instruments and standards .

We are pleased to present this summary of the 2007 European school survey findings produced by the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs ( ESPAD ) .
We have made this summary available in 23 languages to ensure the widest possible dissemination in Europe .
It serves as a complement to the full report that is available in English .
This multilingual summary is a product of the cooperation framework that exists between the EMCDDA and ESPAD .
The mandate of the EMCDDA is to collect , analyse and disseminate factual , objective , reliable and comparable information on the European drug situation .
The information provided by the ESPAD project is an important source of information for obtaining the European picture on younger people .
The ESPAD project provides a common approach to collecting information on substance use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old students in Europe and allows trends over time to be assessed .
The work of the ESPAD project would not have been possible without the generous support of the Swedish Government , the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the Pompidou Group .
Summary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bundesländer ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( Flanders ) .
So far four data collection waves have been conducted within the ESPAD project .
The first study was held in 26 countries in 1995 , while the 2007 data collection was performed in 35 countries .
This summary presents key results from the 2007 survey as well as findings regarding the longterm trends .
An initial section gives a short overview of the methodology .
Country sample sizes were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
Independent research teams in the participating countries form the basis of the collaborative project .
A small number of questions regarding cigarette smoking are given at the beginning of the questionnaire .
On average , in the 2007 survey , 58 % of the students in participating countries reported having tried smoking cigarettes at least once and 29 % had used cigarettes during the past 30 days .
Two percent of all students had smoked at least a packet of cigarettes per day during the past 30 days .
Data were collected by group @-@ administered questionnaires .
The students answered the questionnaires anonymously in the classroom with teachers or research assistants functioning as survey leaders .
There is no obvious geographical pattern at hand , but students in central and eastern European countries are often among those reporting higher rates of smoking .
In all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
In countries where more students smoke , one is also more likely to find students reporting that cigarettes are easily obtainable .
An early smoking debut ( age 13 or younger ) is also associated , at the country level , with high levels of use in the past month .
On average , 7 % of the students said that they had been smoking cigarettes on a daily basis at the age of 13 or younger .
For example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
However , in individual countries great differences may be observable .
For example , boys were 16 percentage points above girls in Armenia and conversely , girls were 19 percentage points above boys in Monaco .
The figures for lifetime , past 12 months and past 30 days prevalences are about the same for boys and girls .
However , when it comes to higher frequencies in the respective time frame ( 40 , 20 and 10 times ) the proportions are usually higher among boys .
If the comparison is confined to the period between 1999 and 2007 , the drop in relatively recent smoking is seven percentage points .
A small overall gender gap ( 4 percentage points ) was noticed in 1995 but this gap had vanished in 2007 .
Only four countries give a contrary image regarding the longterm downward trend in recent smoking , displaying higher levels in 2007 than in 1995 .
Hence , the overall picture of the trend in past 30 days smoking in the ESPAD countries is one of a decrease , or at least of a stabilized situation .
The total amount of alcohol consumed during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequencies .
In nearly all countries boys drink larger quantities than girls . The most pronounced contrast to this is Iceland , where girls report larger quantities than boys .
In a large majority of the countries , beer is the dominant beverage among boys while spirits is the most important beverage among girls in a little more than half of the countries .
Some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom .
However , there are countries in which many students report heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days , while they were rather low on the ranking list for drunkenness for the same period .
Beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . Girls have a more evenly distributed pattern , with spirits as the most important type , constituting about one third of the total consumption .
On average 43 % of the ESPAD students reported heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days , and this was more common among boys ( 47 % ) than among girls ( 39 % ) .
Boys also dominated in a large majority of the countries .
In some few the figures were about the same , but there are also countries in which more girls than boys stated this .
On the country level there is a strong positive relationship between reported alcohol consumption for the last drinking day and the perceived level of intoxication on that day .
In the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
On average , half of the ESPAD students have been intoxicated at least once during their lifetime , to the point of staggering when walking , having slurred speech or throwing up .
There were gender differences in the frequencies of drunkenness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ESPAD level there were no gender differences .
The most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the proportion of students reporting heavy episodic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i.e. by 31 percentage points .
Other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
Countries with many students that have been drunk during the past 12 months usually have high figures for drunkenness during the past 30 days .
Countries in which many students report drunkenness this often include Denmark ( limited comparability ) , the Isle of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days drunkenness .
Countries on the other end of the scale include Armenia ( 2 % ) and Cyprus ( 9 % ) .
This measure of " heavy episodic drinking " shows to some extent a different

Any illicit drugother thancannabislifetime use ( 1 )
( 1 ) " Any illicit drug other than cannabis " includes ecstasy , amphetamines , LSD or other hallucinogens , crack , cocaine and heroin . ( 2 ) Inhalants : ... " ( glue etc ) in order to get high . "
( 3 ) " In order to get high " except for Cyprus ( " to feel differently " ) and Romania ( " to feel better " ) . ( 4 ) Denmark : limited comparability .
Other drugs inquired about , but not included in the illicit drugs @-@ index , are magic mushrooms , GHB and anabolic steroids .
Lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
students reported problems related to their alcohol consumption include Bulgaria , the Isle of Man , the United Kingdom and Latvia .
On the country level there is a positive correlation between problems experienced and intoxication during the past 30 days .
However , for some of the problems the averages are about the same and for one ( " serious problems with friends " ) it is even slightly higher among girls .
In the two top @-@ prevalence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Isle of Man ) one in six students reported cannabis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular cannabis consumption in those countries .
Only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . High @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
One @-@ third of the students in the ESPAD countries find cannabis readily available .
Boys consider cannabis slightly more easily obtainable than girls do , though the gender difference is fairly small .
Countries where many students report past 30 days cannabis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try cannabis , but without doing so .
On average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illicit drugs at least once during their lifetime according to the 2007 survey .
Overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
Country specific differences in the risk of harm from cannabis were found , and the percentage of high @-@ risk users in a population corresponds to the cannabis use prevalence rates in the single countries .
The vast majority of the students who have tried illicit drugs have used cannabis .
On average , slightly more girls than boys report nonprescribed use of these drugs ( 8 % versus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
In about half of the countries there is no gender difference to speak of however .
In Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
Slightly more girls than boys did so ( 8 versus 5 % ) .
This variable shows some similarities with the other one concerning use of pharmaceutical drugs mentioned above .
Firstly , the proportion of students stating lifetime prevalence for these two variables is more or less of the same magnitude .
Since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
The overall impression is that the increase in illicit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ESPAD countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of cannabis between 2003 and 2007 .
Students from Cyprus , the Isle of Man , Malta and Slovenia report the highest lifetime prevalence of inhalants in 2007 ( 16 % ) , while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Ukraine .
The average for lifetime use of inhalants for all ESPAD countries is 9 % and there are no gender differences on the aggregate level .
The rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lifetime use relatively well across countries .
No typical geographic pattern is observed - the highest rates of inhalant use are reported from different parts of Europe .
The lifetime prevalence figures remain relatively stable over the period 1995 @-@ 2007 among countries with data for all four waves .
It is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substances .
Nonprescribed use of tranquillisers or sedatives however shows no correlations on the aggregate country level with use of the substances just mentioned .
Those countries do not cluster . On the contrary ; they are located relatively distant from each other and spread throughout Europe .
The overall substance @-@ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the variable in focus .
The upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lifetime use of illicit drugs - predominantly cannabis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
No changes in gender differences are apparent for illicit drugs or the other substances mentioned .
Individual country prevalence rates for the keyvariables are compared to the averages for all countries .
The countries with results mostly around or below average are Armenia , Cyprus , Greece , Iceland , Portugal and Romania .
The Faroe Islands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the variables .
Most measures on substance use show a recent ( 2003 @-@ 2007 ) stable or slightly downward trend on average , except for heavy episodic drinking .
Two geographically distant countries , Armenia and the Isle of Man , are the ones most distant regarding substance use .

Summary western Europe and countries displaying increases are often found in eastern Europe .
A contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illicit drug use is rising .
To sum up , trend developments over the 12 years of the ESPAD project indicate a fall in smoking in a majority of the countries .
The situation is more or less unchanged as regards alcohol use in the past 12 months and the past 30 days .
On the other hand , heavy episodic drinking shows a small but continuous increase throughout the period .
Use of illicit drugs is still dominated by cannabis use .
Countries displaying rather more upward than downward longterm trends are the Czech and Slovak Republics .
The fourth ESPAD data collection in 2007 gave a lot of new and important information about changes in students " substance use .
We hope that still more European countries will join in the next survey , in addition to the over 40 countries that are part of the ESPAD project already .

This is the 11th annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , available this year in 23 European languages .
and tangible progress has been made . This has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult choices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
Such a policy perspective should be applauded .
The global debate on the drug problem is not short on rhetoric regarding the need for a balanced and evidence @-@ based approach .
In Europe , perhaps more than anywhere else , this rhetoric has become reality .
The information available to support our analysis has grown considerably .
This year 's report is based on data from the 25 EU Member States and Norway and , where available , from Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey .
Not only has the number of countries providing information increased , but the amount of comparable information available from each has continued to grow .
This information provides us with a far more detailed picture of the European drug situation and its dynamics than ever before .
It is the EMCDDA 's task to explore this complexity , drawing together common experiences where they exist as well as commenting on differences .
Drug use is a complex issue , and it is not one that lends itself to simple conclusions .
A reflection on the information available also reminds us of the need for continued vigilance and of the dangers of complacency .
Warning notes are sounded in this report in respect of drugrelated HIV infections and drugrelated deaths .
Nonetheless , in Europe as a whole , a tremendous effort has been made to address these sorts of problems ,

Reitox national focal points
Reitox is the European information network on drugs and drug addiction .
The network is comprised of national focal points in the EU Member States , Norway , the candidate countries and at the European Commission .
Under the responsibility of their governments , the focal points are the national authorities providing drug information to the EMCDDA .
The contact details of the national focal points may be found at : http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 1596
This annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway ( participating in the work of the EMCDDA since 2001 ) in the form of a national report .
The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2004 ( or the last year available ) .
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
An online version of the annual report is available in 23 languages and may be found at http : / / annualreport.emcdda.europa.eu
The 2006 statistical bulletin ( http : / / stats06.emcdda.europa.eu ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
It also provides further details on the methodology used and over 100 additional statistical graphs .
Country data profiles ( http : / / dataprofiles06.emcdda.europa.eu ) provide a top @-@ level , graphical summary of key aspects of the drug situation for each country .
Three in @-@ depth reviews accompany this report and explore the following issues :
• European drug policies : extended beyond illicit drugs ?
• A gender perspective on drug use and responding to drug problems
• Developments in drug use within recreational settings
The selected issues are available in print and online ( http : / / issues06.emcdda.europa.eu ) in English only .
The national reports of the Reitox focal points give a detailed description and analysis of the drug problem in each country and are available on the EMCDDA website ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 435 ) .
Commentary - the drug problem in Europe
Here no consensus currently prevails and different approaches have been adopted across Europe , ranging from the issuing of general operational guidelines through to specification of legal limits .
This can be seen in a number of recent developments that support coordination and cooperation activities .
Among these developments are the coming into force in 2005 of two new EC regulations on precursors and a Council decision on new drugs .
In addition , measures against drug trafficking are strengthened by new legal instruments to address money laundering and confiscation of assets .
However , the development that is most central to shaping European collaboration and future actions on the drug issue is the new EU drug strategy for 2005 @-@ 12 and its two accompanying action plans .
In the first of these , around 100 planned specific actions are detailed by EU Member States to be implemented by 2008 .
A continuous programme of evaluation is envisaged for the strategy , with annual progress reviews and impact assessments at the end of each of the two action plan periods .
Nearly 25 % of opioid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
Across Europe as a whole , the substantial growth in drug substitution treatment that has occurred in recent years means that the treatment system
The strategy can be seen as representing a European consensus on how the drug problem should be addressed .
Nonetheless , the new drug strategy suggests that the European policy debate on drugs is increasingly characterised by agreement on a common framework for activities .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ageing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
available suggests a general decrease in drug injection over the longer term .
However , in many of the new Member States injecting rates remain high .
An important caveat here is that the availability of national or subnational estimates of drug injecting is poor .
Moreover , studies of injecting in some regions have even reported slight increases recently .
Notably , among the old Member States , Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom all report declining rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment .
Heroin consumed in Europe is manufactured predominantly in Afghanistan .
No clear trends are visible with respect to average purity ; however , the five @-@ year price trend ( 1999 @-@ 2004 ) corrected for inflation is downwards in most countries .
Nevertheless , although heroin is more readily available and cheaper in Europe , there is no evidence yet that this is influencing overall levels of consumption .
Among those new to treatment , the numbers with a primary opioid problem have been decreasing in most countries .
Nonetheless , this is an area where waves of epidemic use have been seen in the past , and therefore complacency must be avoided .
For example , needle and syringe provision , once regarded as a controversial intervention , is available to some degree in virtually all Member States , although the coverage varies considerably between countries .
Most countries report low rates of newly diagnosed HIV infection attributable to drug injecting , and HIV infection rates among injectors are estimated to be below 5 % .
In this year 's report , there are worrying indicators that the number of drugrelated deaths , which has generally declined since 2000 , increased slightly in a majority of countries in 2004 .
Injecting and injecting @-@ related health problems : a constant companion
Mirroring to some extent the picture for heroin , overall the information
Treating the HCV @-@ related health problems among drug injectors and ex @-@ injectors is likely to remain a major health cost for many years to come .
Cocaine : signs of stability for Europe 's second most common illicit drug
( Note that these estimates relate to the adult population and are the most recent estimates available .
For complete data and full methodological notes see the accompanying statistical bulletin . )
Lifetime prevalence : at least 65 million , or one in fi ve European adults
Last year use : 22.5 million European adults or one third of lifetime users
Overall range 0.8 % to 11.3 %
Estimates of cocaine use ( last year prevalence ) now place the drug slightly ahead of amphetamine and ecstasy as Europe 's second most used illicit drug .
However , the general picture is one of stabilisation in levels of use after a period in which users of the drug increased considerably in number .
The large increases in cocaine prevalence experienced by Spain and the United Kingdom from the mid to late 1990s seem to have stabilised since 2000 or 2001 .
Elsewhere , while some moderate increases in levels of cocaine use have been noted in a few countries , dramatic increases are not being reported .
Overall , the cocaine situation remains very heterogeneous in Europe and significant cocaine use is restricted to a few , mainly western European , countries .
Last year use : 3 million or one third of lifetime users
Typical range 0.3 % to 1.5 % ( 15 countries )
It would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
In Europe , cocaine use is at historically high levels , and studies suggest that it is a common pattern for increases in problems relating to a drug to lag some years behind increases in prevalence .
This is because it takes time for intensive and regular patterns of drug use to develop and for problems to become visible .
This may be beginning to happen in those European countries where cocaine use is now well established .
Although the use of crack cocaine remains very limited in Europe , reports of problems from some cities suggest that the situation may be deteriorating .
Almost 7 000 acute drug deaths , with opioids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2003 data )
More than half a million opioid users received substitution treatment in 2003
Although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being causally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @-@ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all highprevalence countries .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Drug use in Europe cheaper than ever before data suggest that in Europe as a whole the cost of buying drugs has fallen .
For most countries , the predominant five @-@ year trend has been a decline in street price for cannabis , heroin , amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine ( see graphic below ) .
Data on street prices are difficult both to collect and to interpret .
Drug prices also vary considerably between countries and are subject to fluctuations over time that reflect disruptions in supply .
Prices have been adjusted for national inflation rates ( base year 1999 ) and all series indexed to a base of 100 in 1999 .
Many countries cannot supply these data , which are difficult to obtain and often unreliable and incomplete .

The need better to define and understand polydrug use
A common theme running through this report is the increasing need to develop responses that are sensitive to the complex and multifaceted nature of today 's drug problem .
When prevention , treatment or harm reduction activities are considered , there is a need to better understand what constitutes good practice and evidence @-@ based action .
Among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 , cannabis was the primary reason for referral to treatment in about 15 % of all cases , making it the next most commonly reported drug after heroin .
Treatment services are also dealing with more stimulant and polydrug problems , including a considerable overlap of illicit drug and alcohol problems .
Back to the future : anticipating threats and challenges
In this year 's report , as always , an attempt is made to identify emerging trends to anticipate future problems .
Such analysis is by definition speculative and must be made with caution . A drug clearly associated with severe public health problems is methamphetamine .
While globally methamphetamine problems continue to grow , within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long @-@ established problems .
In 2006 , the EMCDDA published a technical paper on hallucinogenic mushrooms , and this issue is again summarised in our annual reporting .
The availability and use of hallucinogenic mushrooms appears to have been increasing since the late 1990s but to a large extent has passed unnoticed .
For the most part , use of this type of drug appears to be experimental and reports of problems remain rare .
Psilocybin and psilocin , two of the psychoactive substances found in hallucinogenic mushrooms , are controlled by an international convention .
However , the fact that mushrooms grow naturally in many countries poses a more complex issue for legislation , and they are treated differently across Europe .
The emergence of mCPP illustrates the fact that those involved in the production of illicit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chemicals that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA ( ecstasy ) .
Such innovation requires a response as the potential for these substances to cause severe health problems is unknown .

During the reporting period , national drug strategies and action plans were adopted by five countries ( Table 1 ) .
Latvia adopted a national drug strategy for the first time , for the period 2005 @-@ 08 , while new national drug strategies and plans were adopted in the Czech Republic , Spain , Luxembourg and Romania .

There are similarities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @-@ 04 action plan , conducted externally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and internally by the Institute for Drugs and Addiction ( IDT ) .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Hungary and Portugal are the first two countries in Europe to have requested external assessment of their national drug strategies .
There have also been developments in both the types and accessibility of treatment available for drug addicts .
And in Romania , the national drug strategy 2003 @-@ 04 was evaluated with the participation of all state institutions involved in the field of drugs with the findings forming the basis for the new national drug strategy 2005 @-@ 12 .
In Luxembourg , 87 % of the measures set out in the 2000 @-@ 04 national drug action plan have been implemented within the specified deadlines .
It is reported that the measures not introduced ( e.g. a heroin distribution programme ) have been delayed mainly for political reasons .
Actions not yet implemented have been included in the new action plan .
Drugrelated public expenditure
Furthermore , reports over the last year suggest that national drug strategies are beginning to have visible effects .
Two countries reported more recent budgeted expenditure for tackling drugs : Luxembourg ( EUR 6 million in 2005 ) and the United Kingdom ( EUR 2 billion in 2004 / 05 ) .
On the other hand , it also found that there has been a fall in the age at which people first experiment with drugs and an increase in drugrelated deaths linked to substances other than opioids .
In addition , the Ministry of Health and Consumers " Affairs has approved an action plan 2005 @-@ 08 to mobilise resources and implement initiatives with the aim of progressing and revitalising the national drug strategy .
Chapter 1 : Policies and laws and justice in the European Union over the period 2005 @-@ 10 .
This action plan was presented by the Commission in May 2005 and approved by the Council in June 2005 .
Drug supply reduction
First , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 in June 2005 .
It was replaced in December 2004 by a new regulation with an extended application framework aimed at
2 countering also the manufacture of synthetic drugs (
It is conceived as a continuous , incremental and participative process .
It is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the EMCDDA and Europol , will present annual progress reviews .
Finally , the process will be participative , involving an evaluation steering group whose task will be to define the methodology , output and provisional calendar .
As in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the steering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the EMCDDA and Europol , as well as representatives of the Member States .
Consultative hearings for civil society representatives will also be organised .
It has been replaced by a new regulation adopted on 11 February 2004 ( 4 ) .

substances , with a view to preventing the diversion of such substances .
In addition , a regulation laying down rules for implementing these two
These actions in the area of precursors control complete another part of the important activities of the EU in the field of supply reduction .
Utilising the new opportunities provided since the Maastricht Treaty , the EU has developed a legal framework to combat drug trafficking and to improve law enforcement cooperation .
A framework decision on " the confiscation of crime @-@ related proceeds , instrumentalities and property " was also adopted by the Council on 24 February 2005 .
It aims to ensure that all Member States have in place effective rules governing the confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of criminal offences punishable by deprivation of liberty for more than one year .
EU legislation in this area existed previously but was considered insufficient .
This new framework decision aims to achieve effective cross @-@ border cooperation with regard to confiscation .
The Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this framework decision by 15 March 2007 .
In addition to these legal instruments , a programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been adopted and implemented .
Agis is a framework programme to help the police , other relevant agencies and the judiciary from the EU Member States and candidate countries cooperate in criminal matters in the fight against crime .
Since 2003 , it has helped to fund many projects .
Money laundering and confiscation of assets
There have also been some modifications of legal instruments in the field of money laundering and confiscation .
Directive 91 / 308 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modified in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among Member States .

Chapter 1 : Policies and laws
Two new penalties can also be imposed for these offences : monitored home imprisonment or community service .
Possession of more than 10 doses must be charged under Section 172 , which , depending on the aggravating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
In addition , the age of criminal liability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
The maximum sentence for theft of a large amount of drugs or theft by an organised group has been extended to 15 years .
Finally , on 31 August 2005 , the Commission adopted a new proposal for the recasting of the EMCDDA founding regulation .
The new regulation is an important instrument to facilitate the work of the EMCDDA because of the new tasks it defines .
It also contains several changes to the Scientific Committee and the Management Board .
Based on Article 152 TEC , this text must now be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament according to the co @-@ decision procedure .
A few countries made major changes to their drug laws in the reporting period concerning both possession and trafficking offences and penalties .
Exemption from penalty and postponing the execution of the penalty can now be applied to drug law offences .
Treatment of addicts can now take place through an integrated assistance programme , overseen by a case manager .
In Bulgaria , the new Narcotic Substances and Precursors Control Act was approved in June 2004 .
Several countries legislated on threshold quantities of drugs during the reporting period .
Difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure .
In Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
Monitoring of sentences given to drug offenders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
In March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guideline on cannabis , " according to which possession of up to 10 grams of cannabis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
This amount can be increased to 15 grams in individual cases .
The Minister of Health of Lithuania amended recommendations on what shall be regarded as small , large and very large amounts of narcotic and psychotropic substances , redefining these quantities .
The aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
See " The role of the quantity in the prosecution of drug offences , " an ELDD legal report , and Table 1 in " Illicit drug use in the EU : legislative approaches , " an
EMCDDA thematic paper ( both available at http : / / eldd.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 5175 ) .
Other sentencing statistics showed that the waiving of reports as statutory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convictions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
A survey carried out in 2004 among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used cannabis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by stealing ( Kivivuori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
In Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . In the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
From 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed compulsory treatment , effectively decreasing the involvement of the probation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
to extrapolate from , while others refer only to a specific type of drugrelated crime .
Statistics on sentencing , or avoidance of sentencing , give a far more accurate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see EMCDDA , 2002a ) .
Data on " reports " ( 11 ) of drug law offences are available in all the European countries analysed in this report .
They reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
) , it is more appropriate to compare trends rather than absolute numbers .
Routine data are available in the EU only on the last type of crime - drug law offences .
In 2004 , this increasing trend was confirmed in most
For an exact definition for each country , refer to the methodological notes on drug law offences in the 2006 statistical bulletin .
In most EU Member States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
Over the same five @-@ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .
26 upward trends in the number of " reports " involving heroin (
) and / or the proportion of drug offences that involved
countries where this is the case , cannabis @-@ related offences in 2004 accounted for 34 @-@ 87 % of all drug law offences .
Chapter 1 : Policies and laws at presenting a first insight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
European drug policies : extended beyond illicit drugs ? , in EMCDDA 2006 annual report : selected issues
A slow integration , strategically or institutionally , of licit drugs into policy and measures against illicit drugs appears to be more and more common .
In Europe , the scope of drug policies is beginning to stretch beyond illicit drugs and to encompass other addictive substances or even types of behaviour .
This is found in the drug policies of some Member States and in EU drug strategies .
Increasingly , research is addressing the issue of addiction or addictive behaviours irrespective of the substances concerned .
Chapter 2Responding to drug problems in Europe - an overview
Universal school @-@ based prevention
The role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to underpin , support and explain to the population at large the rationale underlying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
Public health prevention
Programme @-@ based prevention approaches are gaining ground within school @-@ based prevention .
Programme @-@ based prevention implies standardised delivery in a defined number of sessions , each with exactly defined contents , and detailed teacher and pupil material .
This facilitates monitoring and evaluation and increases the accuracy , fidelity and consistency of interventions , leading to high @-@ quality delivery .
As a result , more Member States than before are monitoring school @-@ based prevention interventions ( the Czech Republic , Greece , Spain , Ireland , Italy , Cyprus , Hungary , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) .
The first ever European drug abuse prevention trial ( www.eudap.net ) has shown promising results .
A comparable programme @-@ based research approach is Blueprint in the United Kingdom ( 30 ) .
Additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical guidance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @-@ based prevention ( e.g. in France and Ireland ) .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe four countries ( Belgium , Germany , Italy and Luxembourg ) reporting on new projects in this area .
In Italy , the priority of many projects is now to protect children , mothers and immigrant families or those belonging to ethnic minorities .
Luxembourg reports that special attention is given to young people and to the biggest immigrant community , focusing on linguistic and sociocultural specificities .
The main subgroups at which selective prevention in schools is aimed are students with social behavioural problems , school problems or family problems , immigrant students and those belonging to ethnic minorities .
In fact , academic performance and school attendance are good predictors for drug problems , and monitoring these enables early and accurate intervention .
recommends that health promotion and prevention policy should be implemented by school authorities and that the police force should not be involved in prevention programmes .
Following this line of action , Portugal continues to run a proximity policing programme , Escola Segura ( safe school ) .
In France , experts trained by the law enforcement services to liaise with youth or grown @-@ up populations visit schools or other services on request .
Selective prevention
With the recognition and development of the selective prevention approach by most Member States , vulnerable groups are increasingly being targeted .
Similar projects are reported in Ireland , Portugal ( 47 projects ) , Romania ( one project ) and Norway ( brochures for teachers ) .
Students most at risk are targeted by selective prevention programmes in Malta , while in France and Slovakia counselling services are provided in schools on the basis of ( self- ) referral .
Family @-@ based prevention
With growing numbers of younger children initiating drug use , the improvement and intensification of family @-@ based prevention are of increasing importance .
In pre @-@ teenagers , family influence prevails over peer influence .
The role of the family in establishing norms and support for children is more relevant to prevention than imparting information on substances .
Several countries ( e.g. Poland and Slovakia ) have begun to put emphasis on vulnerable groups .
In Sweden , the most obvious increase in activities compared with previous years has been in programmes for pre @-@ school children at risk and school children with externalising behaviours .
The number of municipalities implementing these programmes has approximately doubled .
In addition , Norway is developing a national strategy for early intervention against problem drug and alcohol use in which prevention efforts will specifically target risk groups .
Approaches not based on abstinence are effective in reducing not only consumption but also initiation among those groups in which incipient drug use is already occurring .
Thus , Poland has a nationwide programme to change the drugrelated behaviour of vulnerable children or children who are in the early stages of drug use .
The specific objective of the Polish programme is to support the family in solving drug problems .
In this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
Family @-@ based prevention in the EU is becoming more targeted and more firmly needs @-@ based .
Several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
Chapter 2 : Responding to drug problems in Europe - an overview at risk are now being implemented .
Greece and Austria are leading the way in defining specifications for the accreditation of prevention agencies or prevention professionals .
The " strengthening families programme " ( SFP ) is being implemented in Spain ( Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona ) , the Netherlands ( two cities , evaluation study ) and Sweden ( two cities ) .
Training in Ireland and Italy is under way and it is envisaged in the latter that coverage will extend to several cities .
Norway is evaluating the similar MST programme in a randomised controlled trial .
These selective family @-@ based programmes have similar features in all Member States where they have been implemented .
The context for EMCDDA data collection on harm reduction and treatment responses to the drug problem is provided by two main EU instruments :
Programmes for neglected children and young people from dysfunctional families are being run in Poland and in some provinces in Austria .
These programmes are implemented in local community @-@ based venues such as socio @-@ therapeutic common rooms , upbringing facilities , youth clubs and prevention centres .
Some countries are focusing increasingly on the children of alcoholics ( Belgium , Germany , Austria ) .
The remaining countries still focus solely on the children of drug users .
Community @-@ located prevention
This recommendation has been reinforced by its inclusion in the EU action plan as objective 14 .
Most selective prevention programmes are operated at the level of the community .
Partly , this is because the various social services involved are usually coordinated at this level .
However , in countries where communities have the power and will to enforce local norms , the community is a natural unit for environmental strategies .
In order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the epidemiological situation that has been achieved by the EMCDDA @-@ driven development and implementation of indicator @-@ based monitoring , standardised reporting on responses is limited .
It is now available and used in the majority of Member States .
As buprenorphine is controlled under a less stringent schedule of UN drug conventions , countries are given greater possibilities for its prescription .
In some countries , this treatment option has led to rapid increases in the number of clients treated .
The new Member States and candidate countries account for only a small fraction of the clients in substitution treatment in the European region , which can partly be explained by lower levels of opioid use in these countries .
Although the overall provision of substitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indications of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
By 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( Figure 1 ) . However , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see Chapter 6 ) .

32 receiving such treatment stabilised or decreased (
It is difficult to determine if decreasing numbers of clients receiving methadone treatment means that such clients are switching to buprenorphine treatment when available .
The extent to which drug dependence treatment is delivered by GPs is often not known at national level .
Provision and type of drug dependence treatment
Common response profiles are visible in Europe with regard to the prevention of infectious diseases among drug users and the reduction of drugrelated deaths ( see also Chapter 7 ) .
A survey conducted among national focal points ( NFPs ) in 2005 assessed the general characteristics of treatment provision in Europe .
National experts were asked whether the majority of opioid users were treated in drug @-@ free or medically assisted programmes or whether both modalities were equally prevalent .
The reduction of drugrelated deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
In the Czech Republic , Italy , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , local or regional policies are reported to exist , and in Bulgaria strategies have been drawn up at local level in nine cities .
The results show a ratio largely in favour of medically assisted treatment , with the main substance used being methadone ( except in the Czech Republic and France ; for more details see Chapter 6 ) .
The results further show that drugrelated treatment in most countries is predominantly provided in outpatient settings - only Latvia and Turkey provide most treatment in inpatient settings .
Traditional psychotherapeutic treatment modalities ( psychodynamic , cognitive @-@ behavioural , systemic / family therapy or Gestalt therapy ) are the most frequently used modalities in outpatient treatment in Ireland , Latvia , the United Kingdom , Bulgaria and Turkey .
This emphasises the continued importance that European governments and the Commission place on the healthrelated
Actions and interventions concerning drug users in prisons in the new Member States
The present data are based on a joint EMCDDA @-@ WHO / Europe data collection project that was conducted in 2005 ( 1
not appear to exist , and few countries report the availability of opioid substitution treatment for acute detoxification in prison ( Hungary , Malta , Poland and Slovenia ) .
Drugrelated prerelease interventions mainly take the form of counselling and information provision ( Czech Republic , Latvia , Lithuania , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia ) .
Substitution treatment as a prerelease intervention is available in all prisons in Slovenia and in less than 50 % of prisons in Poland .
Drug testing in prisons is reported in the majority of new Member States .
However , countries vary in terms of their drug testing schemes .
Inmates are tested upon admission only in the Czech Republic , Malta and Slovenia .
Malta and Slovenia are also the only countries to test prisoners before they go on leave .
Random drug testing is carried out in all prisons in the Czech Republic , Malta , Slovenia and Slovakia and in less than 50 % of prisons in Hungary .
Few prisons in the new Member States report harm reduction measures for injecting drug users .
Needle and syringe exchange programmes are not implemented in prisons in any of the new Member States , and only Estonia , Lithuania and Slovenia report the provision of disinfectants for cleaning syringes .
Nevertheless , drugrelated infectious diseases are being tackled in prisons .
Antiretroviral treatment for HIV @-@ positive prisoners is reported by all new Member States ( 2 ) .
Hungary , Malta , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia .
For further references see EMCDDA ( 2005c ) .
According to the reports by NFPs ( 35 ) , objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of synergy at the European level . Besides drug injectors , target groups include sex workers and prisoners .
In the new central European Member States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @-@ injectors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent infectious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies widen the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
In many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
However , in 10 countries ( 37 % ) , infectious disease strategies explicitly mention the prevention of hepatitis C infection among drug
) Including France and England , both of which have established full @-@ blown hepatitis C prevention strategies : Plan national hepatites virales C et B ( 2002 @-@ 05 )
Targeted treatment and quality management public discussion in Austria was boosted by an international conference on the topic held in Vienna in 2005 .
The current EU action plan also calls for high @-@ quality treatment and harm reduction services .
The common strategic platform on the reduction of healthrelated harm that the EU drug strategy provides is mirrored in many national policies across the EU and has supported a mainstreaming of evidence @-@ based responses in this area .
In 2004 , an improvement in the monitoring of syringe availability at European level was documented .
However , information on the provision , utilisation and coverage of the wide range of further important services delivered by lowthreshold agencies is barely recorded at national level in most countries .
A European picture cannot easily be drawn .
A project to improve the data situation is described in the box " Low @-@ threshold agencies as an important data source . "
Lowthreshold agencies as an important data source
Treatment units or programmes that exclusively service one specified target group are a common phenomenon across the EU .
For populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
Units that specialise in treating cannabis or cocaine users have been reported from 13 countries , and specific treatment programmes for these groups in drugs agencies exist in eight countries .
However , the availability and accessibility of such services are rated to be low in most of these countries .
A similar specialised programme for amphetamine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
An initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ Correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The 2005 @-@ 08 action plan calls on Member States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social reintegration programmes . "
Although social measures are still a less well @-@ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interventions combining treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug user rehabilitation .
Nonetheless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
In 2004 / 05 , in response to the EU action plan , 20 of the
The main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
Under the current economic circumstances , many countries may find it difficult to meet the vocational reintegration needs of older heroin users , even if they are stabilised in drug maintenance treatment .
The service most commonly offered to homeless problem drug users is access to " generic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries combine the two systems .
All the available literature and facts and figures from Member States converge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and precarious than those of the general population .
Thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social reintegration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
) Social reintegration is defined as " any social intervention with the aim of integrating former or current problem drug users into the community . " The three
" pillars " of social reintegration are housing , education and employment ( including vocational training ) .
Other measures , such as counselling and leisure activities , may also be used .
As facilities are currently available in most countries , and as some countries continue to implement new structures , the effect of these measures will depend on ensuring that homeless problem drug users can access these services .
How have Member States developed gender @-@ specific approaches to drug prevention , treatment , social rehabilitation and harm reduction ?
Are gender @-@ specific responses equally important for males and females ?
Generally among drug users , males far outnumber females .
In the EU Member States , not only is the use of illicit drugs more common in males , but men are much more likely to develop problems , seek treatment and die from drug use .
This selected issue looks at drug use and related problems from a gender perspective .
Among the important questions
Production and trafficking
Other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the cannabis resin seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Senegal , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; INCB , 2006a ) .
Largescale production of cannabis resin is concentrated in a few countries , in particular Morocco , but also Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Total global production of cannabis resin is estimated to be 7 400 tonnes annually ( CND , 2006 ) .
Most cannabis resin consumed in the EU originates in Morocco ; it is smuggled mainly via the Iberian peninsula , although the Netherlands seems to represent a secondary distribution centre for further transport to EU countries .
In 2004 , the total area under cultivation amounted to 120 500 hectares
Global potential herbal cannabis production was estimated at over 40 000 tonnes in 2003 ( CND , 2005 ) , with source countries throughout the world .
In addition , local ( indoor or outdoor ) cultivation and production of cannabis products takes place in most of the EU Member States .
Interpreting seizures and other market data
Worldwide , a total of 1 471 tonnes of cannabis resin and 6 189 tonnes of herbal cannabis was seized in 2004 .
Quantities seized may fluctuate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seizures are very large .
For this reason , the number of seizures is sometimes a better indicator of trends .
In all countries , the number of seizures includes a major proportion of small seizures at the retail ( street ) level .
Where known , origin and destination of drugs seized may indicate trafficking routes and producing areas .
The price and purity / potency of drugs at retail level are reported by most of the Member States .
However , data come from a range of different sources , which are not always comparable , making accurate comparisons between countries difficult. cult .
in the EU as a whole declined between 1999 and 2003 , trends in reporting countries indicate an increase at EU level
) This should be checked against missing 2004 data when available .
Data on both number of cannabis seizures and quantities of cannabis seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on number of cannabis seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .
For estimating purposes , 2004 missing data were replaced by 2003 data .
Data on quantities seized in 2004 provided by the Netherlands were only estimates , which could not be included in the analysis of trends to 2004 .
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe shows a continuous increase over the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , although in 2004 a majority of countries ( but not Spain )
42 reported a decline (
Only two countries , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , have reported on the average price of locally produced herbal cannabis , and in both cases it has declined .

Prevalence and patterns of cannabis use increased since 1999 and , based upon data from reporting countries , continued to increase in 2004 .
Price and potency
Cannabis is the illegal substance most frequently used in Europe .
Its use increased in almost all EU countries during the 1990s , in particular among young people , including school students .
It is estimated that about 65 million European adults , that is about 20 % of those aged 15 @-@ 64 , have tried the substance

Estimating drug use in the population
Last year use is clearly lower than lifetime experience .
It is estimated that about 22.5 million European adults have used cannabis in the last year , about 7 % of those aged 15 @-@ 64 .
Estimates of last month prevalence will more closely represent regular use of the drug .
It is estimated that 12 million European adults have used the drug in the last 30 days , about 4 % of adults .
Country figures range between 0.5 % and 7.5 % , a 15 @-@ fold difference .
The lowest figures were reported from Lithuania , Malta , Sweden and Bulgaria , and the highest from the Czech Republic ( 4.8 % ) , Spain ( 7.6 % ) and the United Kingdom ( 5.6 % ) ( 57 ) .
" Last year use " and " last month use " reflect the current situation more accurately , with the latter weighted more heavily towards people who use the drug frequently .
Use of illegal drugs , including cannabis , is concentrated mainly among young people .
ESPAD surveys were conducted in 1995 , 1999 and 2003 .
The next survey will take place in 2007 .
Participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
The survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illicit drugs , with the standard time frames , and frequency of use .
Information on ESPAD and the availability of reports can be found on the ESPAD website ( www.espad.org ) .
For more information about methodology of population surveys and the methodology used in each national survey , see the 2006 statistical bulletin .
By contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 40.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lifetime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
Note that the age range for " all adults " in the US survey ( 12 years and over ) is wider than the age standard range for European surveys ( 15 @-@ 64 ) .

Patterns of cannabis use
Five EU Member States ( Belgium , Spain , Italy , Cyprus and the United Kingdom ) reported new data from national school surveys , and Bulgaria reported data from school surveys conducted in two major cities .
Countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @-@ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lifetime prevalence ranges from 32 % to 40 % .
The lowest lifetime prevalence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
See Table EYE 3 and Figure EYE 1 ( part i ) in the 2006 statistical bulletin .

This could represent an important long @-@ term change in cannabis use patterns that merits further attention .
at European level . A crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
Other countries are also working on scales to assess intensive forms of cannabis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area .
Use of cannabis , like that of other illegal drugs , is notably higher among males than among females .
Cannabis use is also more common in urban areas or areas with a high population density .
It has been hypothesised that use may be spreading to smaller towns or rural areas , and Poland documented this trend in its 2005 national report .
65 forms of cannabis use (
Tracking long @-@ term trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence of reliable time @-@ series data .
However , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the early 1990s onwards , and some of these are now beginning to provide valuable insights into trends over time .
It is generally considered that cannabis use started to spread in some European countries in the 1960s and became popular in the 1970s and 1980s .
Swedish data document a relatively high level of experimentation in the 1970s among conscripts ( 15 @-@ 20 % ) .
The fact that intensive cannabis use often co @-@ occurs with non @-@ drug @-@ specifi c mental problems has practical implications .
All other treatment modalities have either not been studied at all or insufficiently studied ; thus evidence for efficacy and effectiveness is lacking .
) See Figure GPS @-@ 24 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ) There is as yet no universally accepted definition of " intensive cannabis use " ; rather the definition varies across different studies .
It is , however , a broad term meaning use of cannabis that exceeds a certain threshold of frequency .
It does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
In this chapter , figures refer to " daily or almost daily use " ( defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days ) .
This benchmark has often been used in studies and can be derived from the European model questionnaire .
Risk of dependency among less frequent users is lower .
Estimates of last month prevalence also generally increased in the past decade , although pronounced increases occurred only in Belgium and Spain .
The United Kingdom has recently reported a decrease in last month use , having previously presented the highest levels in Europe since the early 1990s .
In addition , Slovakia reported a decrease between 2002 and 2004 .
In the Czech Republic and France it was not possible to assess the trend .
68 to interpret because of methodological changes (
Figure 3 : Trends in last year prevalence of cannabis use among young adults ( aged 15 @-@ 34 )
In addition , school surveys can give valuable information about trends in drug use among the younger members of the population , which may predict future trends among young adults .
In most countries , since 1995 , there has been an overall increase in the number of school students who have ever tried cannabis .
However , geographical variations in trends are marked .
Trends in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among school students aged 15 @-@ 16 years can be categorised into three geographical groups .
In Ireland and the United Kingdom , which have long histories of cannabis use , lifetime prevalence is high but has remained stable during the last decade ( around 37 @-@ 39 % ) .
In the eastern and central European Member States , together with Denmark , Spain , France , Italy and Portugal , lifetime prevalence of cannabis use in 2003 was substantially higher than it was in 1995 .
See Table GPS @-@ 4 in the 2006 statistical bulletin for further information.Sources : Reitox national reports ( 2005 ) , taken from population surveys , reports or scientific articles .
) See Figure TDI @-@ 2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . )
Over the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , the proportion of all new clients seeking treatment for cannabis increased in most countries that reported data ( 73
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
74 in a few countries the proportions are roughly equal (
75 outpatient settings (
It is also important to understand better the needs of cannabis users at the population level .
The EMCDDA estimates there are around 3 million intensive cannabis users ( defined as daily or almost daily cannabis use ) in the EU .
Although the number of these requiring interventions is unknown , the number of cannabis @-@ related treatment demands is small in relation to this figure .
A number of factors are likely to be associated with the increased demand for cannabis treatment , and this remains an area requiring research scrutiny .
The available data suggest that cannabis clients in outpatient treatment centres tend to be relatively young : virtually all cannabis clients new to treatment are under 30 years old .
Most clients report having first used cannabis when in the youngest age groups , with 36.8 % using the drug for the first time before the age of 15 .
Almost no one seeking treatment reports having used cannabis for the first time after the age of
Overall , cannabis clients can be divided into three groups : those who use it occasionally ( 34 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 32 % ) and those using it daily ( 34 % ) .
This variation probably reflects differences in referral to treatment ( e.g. more referrals from the criminal justice system or from social networks ) ( 77 ) .
The extent to which cannabis users in treatment meet diagnostic criteria for either dependence or harmful drug use is an important question .
As referral practices differ between countries , there is a need for studies to document the differing clinical characteristics of those receiving treatment for cannabis use .
Well @-@ implemented universal prevention programmes can delay or reduce the initiation of young people into the use of substances such as tobacco , alcohol and cannabis .
The importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @-@ onset users ( pre- to mid @-@ adolescence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( Von Sydow et al . , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ) .
An additional consideration in striving to prevent or delay the onset of initiation into cannabis use is the fact that adolescents are more vulnerable to cannabis toxicity .
Some clients seek treatment for cannabis use in combination with other drug or alcohol problems , and sometimes the request for treatment is related to more general problems , such as conduct disorder among young people . Furthermore ,
The profiles of young cannabis users , at least in the early stages of consumption , do not differ from those of young alcohol or tobacco users .
This supports the idea that universal
See Tables TDI @-@ 3 ( part iii ) and TDI @-@ 4 ( part iii ) in the 2006 statistical bulletin . )
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on cannabis alone , but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too .
Alternative strategies are to offer short but structured courses with around 10 group sessions ( Germany , Denmark , the Netherlands , Austria ) .
An accompanying manual , SKOLL ( self @-@ control training ) , has been launched by a Dutch @-@ German Euregio project .
Often , cannabis @-@ specific " training courses " rely on the fact that cannabis use or possession is illegal and participants are referred via the criminal justice system .
Motivation to participate largely comes from the fact that attendance at such courses is an obligatory part of a judicial sentence .
Nonetheless , these methods enable contact to be established with at least part of the group at risk .
Gender is an important issue in cannabis prevention ( see the selected issue on gender ) .
However , this is changing as the traditional roles of males and females change in modern societies .
In several European countries projects aimed at preventing cannabis as well as alcohol use ( Bagmaendene , Denmark ; Beer @-@ Group , Germany ; and Risflecting , Austria ) attempt to address boys " lack of communication skills .
It is known that one reason for intensive consumption of alcohol and cannabis among boys is that they find it difficult to approach girls , and thus these projects offer training in flirting .
The German project Stoned at School aims to train teachers in early detection and early intervention , prevention of cannabis consumption , and establishing contact between schools and drug counselling facilities .
Like similar projects in Austria , it is a 10 @-@ module training scheme to increase teachers " awareness of cannabis consumption and identify pupils at risk .
Many European selective prevention interventions tend towards the provision of information on cannabis .
The same authors found that comprehensive social influence programmes have an important effect on vulnerable young people .
Specific drug counselling centres are frequent in Germany , France and the Netherlands .
Since January 2005 , more than 250 " cannabis consultation " clinics have been set up throughout the French territories .
They are located in the major French cities for easy access .
This new type of structure is to be subjected a follow @-@ up study .
Brief intervention for cannabis users
Brief interventions are cost @-@ effective and may be particularly appropriate to cannabis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
• are experiencing few problems with their drug use ;
• have low levels of dependence ;
• have a short history of drug use ;
Brief intervention is an approach that aims to make people reflect on their use of drugs and to provide them with skills to control it .
• are unsure or ambivalent about changing their drug use .
Brief intervention is often targeted at an early stage of a person 's alcohol or drug use to prevent the development of serious drug problems later on .
There is evidence for the effectiveness of brief intervention in preventing alcohol and tobacco misuse , and there is growing interest in the value of this approach for other substances .
This kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interventions may take the form of counselling , " cannabis courses " or even self @-@ help websites .
For example , the German website @-@ based counselling programme , Quit the Shit ( www.drugcom.de ) , is an innovative approach , using telematics , for cannabis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .
Similar websites with self @-@ help components include www.jellinek.nl / zelfhulp / cannabis / frameset.html by Jellinek ( the Netherlands ) and www.knowcannabis.org.uk / by HIT ( United Kingdom ) .
Chapter 4Amphetamines , ecstasy and other psychotropic drugs
Supply and availability ( 81 )
The production of amphetamines and ecstasy is difficult to quantify because " it starts with readily available chemicals , in easily concealed laboratories " ( UNODC , 2003a ) .
The most recent estimate of annual global production of amphetamines and ecstasy is about 520 tonnes ( UNODC , 2003b ) .
Global seizures of these substances peaked in 2000 at 46 tonnes .
Following a decline in 2001 and 2002 , seizures increased again to 34 tonnes in 2003 , and declined slightly to 29 tonnes in 2004 .
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants .
Of the two drugs , amphetamine is by far the more commonly available in Europe .
Worldwide , increasing levels of use of methamphetamine are a cause for considerable concern , as the drug is associated with a range of severe health problems .
Within Europe , significant methamphetamine use appears to be restricted to the Czech Republic .
Ecstasy refers to synthetic substances that are chemically related to amphetamines but which differ to some extent in their effects .
The best @-@ known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) , but other analogues are also occasionally found in ecstasy tablets ( MDA , MDEA , etc . ) .
These drugs are sometimes known as entactogens , a reference to their very specific mood @-@ altering effects .
Sometimes they provoke effects more typically associated with hallucinogenic substances .
Worldwide , amphetamine production remains concentrated in western and central Europe , in particular in Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland .
Outside Europe , amphetamine is mainly manufactured in North America and Oceania ( CND , 2006 ) .
Trafficking in amphetamine in 2004 remained mainly intraregional .
Most amphetamine found on European illicit markets comes from Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland , and also from Estonia and Lithuania ( in the Nordic countries ) ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ) .
Historically , lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) has been by far the best @-@ known hallucinogenic drug , but overall consumption levels have been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time .
Recently , evidence of increased availability and use of naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances , hallucinogenic mushrooms in particular , has emerged .
In 2004 , an estimated 33 000 seizures of amphetamine , amounting to 5.2 tonnes and 9.6 million units , were made in the EU .
To detect new drugs emerging on the European drug scene , the EU has in place an early @-@ warning system .
This system also monitors potentially harmful new trends in the use of psychoactive substances .

Although the Netherlands remained in 2004 the main source of ecstasy for Europe and the world as a whole , ecstasy laboratories were also uncovered in Belgium , Estonia , Spain and Norway ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; UNODC , 2006 ) .
) This situation should be checked against 2004 data for the United Kingdom when available .
Data on both number of amphetamine seizures and quantities of amphetamine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on quantities of amphetamine seized were not available for Slovenia in 2004 ; data on number of amphetamine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .

An exception to this finding occurred in Bulgaria , where a high percentage ( 61 % ) of tablets analysed contained amphetamine and / or methamphetamine as the only psychoactive substances .
The MDMA content of ecstasy tablets varies greatly between batches ( even between those with the same logo ) both between and within countries .
In 2004 , the average content of active substance ( MDMA ) per ecstasy tablet was reported to range from 30 to 82 mg ( 100 ) ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ) .

In Europe 122 litres of safrole was seized in 2004 , mainly in Latvia but also in Lithuania .
Prevalence and patterns of use
Traditionally , population surveys have shown that , next to cannabis , amphetamines and ecstasy are the illegal substances most commonly used , albeit the overall prevalence of their use is lower than that of cannabis .
Use of ecstasy became popular during the 1990s , whereas amphetamines have been used for much longer .
Among EU Member States , use of amphetamines (
) and ecstasy appears to be relatively high in only a few countries , namely the Czech Republic , Estonia and the United Kingdom .
Licit trade of ephedrine and pseudo @-@ ephedrine amounted to a total of 526 and 1 207 tonnes respectively in 2004 .
The largest seizures of these chemicals were reported in North America and South @-@ East Asia , but there is concern that seizures have spread to all regions .

Reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . However , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .

increasingly reported .
For example , in the United Kingdom , during the early 2000s , the number of shops selling hallucinogenic mushrooms increased , and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stalls across the country .
The sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms through the Internet also emerged , with sites , mainly based in the Netherlands , selling fresh mushrooms , growing kits and spore prints .
Online marketing of hallucinogenic mushrooms is conducted in a variety of languages , mainly English , French and German , implying a wide international consumer base .
Recent adult and school population surveys in the EU indicate that , among young people aged 15 @-@ 24 years , lifetime use of hallucinogenic mushrooms ranges from less than 1 % to 8 % ( 128 ) .
However , there are indications that continuation rates are lower for hallucinogenic mushrooms than for most other drugs .
This is a common feature of hallucinogenic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to confine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for recreational purposes ( 130 ) .
In March 2001 the UN drug control system added GHB to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU Member States have been updating their legislation on this substance .

However , the absence of accurate and comparable systems for recording deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of these substances limits the data available in this area .
Two countries have reported deaths related to GHB , usually in association with other drugs .
In Sweden , detections of GHB ( or its precursors GBL and 1,4 @-@ BD ) in body fluid specimens increased from 24 in 1997 to 367 in 2004 .
Deaths associated with GHB have also been reported in Sweden : between 1996 and 2004 the drug was detected in 36 drugrelated deaths , with nine of these occurring in 2004 .
In England and Wales in 2003 , GHB was mentioned in the coroner 's report of three deaths , in one of which GHB was the only drug mentioned ( ONS , 2006 ) .
However , toxicological information from one hospital in the United Kingdom , covering a large region , indicates that GHB was detected in five deaths between May and December 2005 ( 131 ) .
The decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances so that measures applicable in the Member States for the control of narcotic and psychotropic substances ( 2 ) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances if appropriate .

Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe mCPP may be intended to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA .
It has been identified within the space of a year in 20 Member States as well as in Romania and Norway .
The first official notifications of the detection of mCPP were received by the EMCDDA and Europol in February / March 2005 , concerning samples collected in France and Sweden .
They are almost always designed to look like , and presumably marketed as , ecstasy .
The drug is chiefly available in tablet form , and the subjective effects of mCPP and MDMA are partially comparable ( Bossong et al . , 2005 ) .
In addition , mCPP is often found in combination with MDMA .
Since this is unlikely to be the result of accidental contamination , it suggests that the deliberate addition of

Cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after herbal cannabis and cannabis resin .
In 2004 , an estimated 60 000 seizures of 74 tonnes of cocaine were made in the EU .
Most seizures of cocaine are reported in western European countries , especially Spain , which accounts for about half the seizures and amounts
1 35 recovered in the EU in the last five years (
Over the period 1999 @-@ 2004 , the number of cocaine seizures ( 136 ) increased overall at EU level , while quantities ( 137 ) seized fluctuated within an upward trend .
However , based on reporting countries , quantities appear to have declined in 2004 - perhaps in comparison with the exceptional amount recovered in Spain the year before .

The average prices of cocaine , corrected for inflation ( 139 ) , showed an overall downward trend over the period 1999 @-@ 2004 in all
Colombia is by far the largest source of illicit coca in the world , followed by Peru and Bolivia .
Most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America ( mainly Colombia ) or via Central America and the Caribbean . In 2004 , Suriname , Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , Ecuador , Curaçao , Jamaica , Mexico , Guyana and Panama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; CND , 2006 ; INCB , 2006a ; Europol , 2006 ) .
The main points of entry in the EU remain Spain , the Netherlands and Portugal , as well as Belgium , France and the United Kingdom ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; CND , 2006 ; Europol , 2006 ) .
Although Spain and the Netherlands still play an important role as distribution points for the reporting countries (

Prevalence and patterns of cocaine use
Based on recent national population surveys , it is estimated
14 5 that about 10 million Europeans (
) have tried cocaine at least once ( lifetime prevalence ) , representing over 3 % of all adults ( 146 ) .
National figures on reported use range between 0.5 % and 6 % , with Italy ( 4.6 % ) , Spain ( 5.9 % ) and the United Kingdom ( 6.1 % ) at the upper end of this range .
It is estimated that about 3.5 million adults have used cocaine in the last year , representing 1 % of all adults .
) from licit trade for use in the illicit manufacture of cocaine , in particular in the Americas .
The licit trade in potassium permanganate is large : since 1999 , 30 exporting countries / territories have provided 4 380 preexport notifications to the INCB involving over 136 560 tonnes of potassium permanganate .
In 2004 , 1.4 tonnes of potassium permanganate was seized in Europe , mainly in the Russian Federation , followed by Romania and Ukraine ( 144 ) ( INCB , 2006b ) .
Traffickers appear to have found ways to avoid controls and monitoring mechanisms introduced under Operation Purple .
Indeed , although the illicit manufacture of cocaine
As with other illegal drugs , cocaine use is concentrated among young adults .
Lifetime experience is highest among young adults aged 15 @-@ 34 years , although last year use is slightly higher among 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Last year use ranges between 0.2 % and 4.8 % , with the figures for Denmark , Ireland , Italy and the Netherlands being around 2 % , and for Spain and the United Kingdom over 4 % ( Figure 6 ) .

However , crack cocaine users may pose particular challenges for treatment services as they tend to have a more marginalised social profile than users of cocaine powder .
After opioids and cannabis , cocaine is the drug most commonly reported as the reason for entering treatment and accounts for about 8 % of all treatment demands across the EU in 2004 ( 151 ) .

Combining several specific psychosocial treatment interventions is currently considered the most promising treatment option for cocaine and other psychostimulant users .
Immunotherapy for cocaine addicts
In contrast to heroin addiction , which can be treated with agonists such as methadone or antagonists such as naltrexone , there are currently no medical treatments available for cocaine addiction .
The reason for this would appear to be the mechanism of action through which cocaine exerts its effects on the brain neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin .
Harm reduction approaches
One exciting strand of research is the use of immunotherapy , i.e. the development of a vaccine that would effectively " neutralise " the action of cocaine by preventing the drug from reaching the brain .
The basic concept has undergone limited testing .
A vaccine developed in the United Kingdom was tested in a small number of cocaine addicts , 18 in total , over a period of 14 weeks .
It was found that three quarters of the vaccinated cohort of cocaine addicts were able to remain drug free for a period of three months with no untoward sideeffects .
In addition , after six months , both those who relapsed and those who did not stated that the feelings of euphoria were not as potent as prior to vaccination .
As a result of these findings , the vaccine , known as drug @-@ protein conjugate TA @-@ CD , is undergoing phase 2 clinical trials .
An alternative immunotherapeutic approach involves the development of monoclonal antibodies to cocaine , but this has only been tested preclinically .
The potential benefit of the cocaine vaccine TA @-@ CD has raised ethical concerns about the use of a vaccine : who would receive it , who would make the decision and on what criteria , etc .
In Europe , the development of harm reduction approaches that target cocaine use has been limited .
The value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely unexplored , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
As cocaine use can escalate quickly , brief interventions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth exploring .
In a number of cities crack cocaine users have been targeted by outreach schemes that attempt to engage with what is often viewed as a difficult group to work with .
Although overall the evidence base remains relatively weak , some studies have suggested that benefits can accrue .
For example , one study of an innovative outreach treatment programme in Rotterdam ( Henskens , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for treating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
A more controversial approach has been adopted in some cities in Europe , where the concept of safe consumption rooms , usually targeting drug injection , has been extended to drug inhalation .
Rooms for supervised inhalation have been opened in several Dutch , German and Swiss cities ( EMCDDA , 2004c ) .

Production and trafficking centre to other western European countries .
Heroin seizures in 2004 suggest that the southern branch has now gained the same importance as the northern branch in terms of volume smuggled ( WCO , 2005 ; INCB , 2006a ) .
Global potential production of heroin was estimated at 472 tonnes in 2005 ( 495 in 2004 ) ( UNODC , 2006 ) .
In 2004 , 210 tonnes of opium ( or 21 tonnes of heroin equivalent ) , 39.3 tonnes of morphine and 59.2 tonnes of heroin were seized worldwide .
Asia ( 50 % ) and Europe ( 40 % ) continued to account for the greatest quantities of heroin seized worldwide .
Heroin enters Europe by two major trafficking routes .
The historically important Balkan route continues to play a crucial role in heroin smuggling .
16 2 since 2001 , 22 exporting countries / territories have provided 7 684 preexport notifications to the INCB involving over 1 350 000 tonnes of acetic anhydride .
Seizures in Turkey ( 1 600 litres in 2004 ) have significantly declined in recent years , perhaps indicating that traffickers have developed new routes and methods of diversion .
In 2004 , for the first time , seizures in Europe ( Bulgaria ) were identified as having come from south @-@ western Asia ( INCB , 2006b ) .

Moreover , estimates are often localised geographically , and extrapolation to form national estimates are not necessarily reliable .
historically predominated now report changes towards other drugs .
Most heroin users are now believed to use stimulants and other drugs besides opioids , but reliable data on polydrug use are very hard to obtain at the EU level ( see Chapter 8 ) .
Despite the general trend towards diversification of the phenomenon , in many countries estimates of problem drug use are exclusively based on problem use of heroin or other opioids as the primary substance .
This can be seen in the estimated rates of problem opioid use ( see Figure 8 ) , which
Estimating the number of problem opioid users is difficult , and analyses of a sophisticated nature are required to obtain prevalence figures from the available data sources .
Estimated prevalence rates of problem opioid use differ greatly between countries , although when different methods have been used within one country the results are largely consistent .

A lack of reliable and consistent historical data complicates the assessment of trends over time in problem opioid use .

Long @-@ term drug substitution is not the only purpose of opioid pharmacotherapy .
This form of treatment remains controversial and is generally provided on a scientific trial basis for long @-@ term users in whom other therapeutic options have failed .
Abstinence @-@ based treatment showed good outcomes with regard to HIV prevention for those who remain in treatment for three months or more ( Farrell et al . , 2005 ) .
Monitoring methadone provision
Methadone is a controlled drug according to Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs , and levels of domestic consumption are monitored annually by the INCB .
There is now a robust evidence base for the value of substitution programmes using drugs such as methadone or buprenorphine .
Research has also suggested that levels of criminal activity may be reduced and that sufficient provision of substitution treatment may have an impact on the number of drugrelated deaths .
Optimum outcomes depend on timely entry into the programme , sufficient duration and continuity of substitution treatment , and adequate doses of medication .
Excluding the Czech Republic and France , where high @-@ dose buprenorphine treatment ( HDBT ) is reported to be the most common option , more than 90 % of treatments in all other countries were with methadone .
In Turkey , methadone is officially registered for the treatment of opioid dependency , but no treatment cases have been reported .

As a rule , noticeable increases in consumption figures follow the introduction of this treatment option at national level .
Recently , signs of a stabilisation in levels of methadone consumption can be observed in the statistics for Denmark , Spain , Malta , the Netherlands , and possibly Germany .
This matches reported trends in the number of clients in treatment ( see Chapter 2 ) .

Chapter 7Drug @-@ related infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
In the United Kingdom , the incidence of HIV among IDUs has slowly increased but is now stable at just under 2.5 cases per million population per year .
Reducing drug injecting and the sharing of injecting equipment has therefore become a primary goal of public health interventions in this area .
Studies also point to a relationship between drug use and high @-@ risk sexual activity ; this suggests a growing importance in linking drug use interventions with public health strategies aimed at sexual health .
HIV outbreaks related to injecting drug use occurred as recently as 2001 in Estonia and Latvia , and 2002 in Lithuania .
HIV seroprevalence among tested IDUs
Seroprevalence data from IDUs ( percentage infected in samples of IDUs ) are an important complement to HIV case reports .
Repeated seroprevalence studies and routine monitoring of data from diagnostic tests can support conclusions drawn from case reporting data and can provide more detailed information on specific regions and settings .
However , prevalence data come from a variety of sources and , in some cases , may be difficult to compare ; thus , they should be interpreted with caution .
At present , most countries report low rates of newly diagnosed HIV infection attributed to injecting drug use .
Furthermore , data emerging from some countries are raising concerns that HIV infection may be increasing , at least among some populations of IDUs .
In France , where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003 , there has been an increase in the incidence of HIV among IDUs ( albeit from a low level ) , from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in

In Latvia , two time series of seroprevalence data among IDUs show a continued increase until 2002 / 03 while a third series suggests a decrease since the peak in 2001 .
In Spain and Italy , national data from case reporting are not available .
) See Figure INF @-@ 5 ( part ii ) and ( part vi ) in the 2006 statistical bulletin .
Finally , in some countries that have never experienced largescale epidemics among IDUs , some recent prevalence data suggest that vigilance is warranted .
This would seem to be the case in Luxembourg , Austria and the United Kingdom , although the increases remain limited and are not confirmed by case reporting data .
Portugal is still the country with the highest incidence of IDU @-@ related AIDS , with 31 cases per million population in 2004 .
However , in Latvia the incidence is similar : 30 cases per million .
EuroHIV data up to 2004 ( corrected for reporting delay ) suggest that the incidence of IDU @-@ related AIDS is increasing
HIV prevalence among tested IDUs continues to vary widely between countries in the EU ( Figure 10 ) .
In a number of countries HIV prevalence among IDUs has recently increased or has been high for many years .
Sex differences in HIV prevalence among tested IDUs
Available seroprevalence data for 2003 @-@ 04 reveal
1 88 differences between male and female tested IDUs (
Overall prevalence was 13.6 % among males and 21.5 % among females .
See Figure INF @-@ 1 ( part i ) in the 2006 statistical bulletin . )

Preventing infectious diseases
It must be noted that evidence on effectiveness is strongest for the prevention of HIV infection among drug injectors .
A robust body of available evidence shows that interventions can be considered effective and that access to treatment of all types provides protection ( Farrell et al . , 2005 ; WHO , 2005 ) .
Since the mid1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see Chapter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of epidemic spread of HIV among injectors .
The prevalence of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) markers also varies greatly both within and between countries .
The most complete data are for anti @-@ HBc , which indicates a history of infection .
In 2003 @-@ 04 , prevalence rates of over 60 % among IDU samples were reported from Italy and Poland , while samples with prevalence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium , Ireland , Cyprus , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
In the Nordic region , the great majority of notified acute cases of hepatitis B occur among IDUs , and hepatitis B outbreaks have coincided with increases in drug injecting in several countries .
In Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .

Types of needle and syringe programmes in European countries
See Table NSP @-@ 2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin .
Syringe coverage in Europe : is it sufficient ? cient ?
In Northern Ireland , needle and syringe exchange is currently organised exclusively through pharmacies .
The purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
Mortality and drugrelated deaths
From these data , it is possible to make a crude estimation of the annual number of syringes available per injector ( 1 ) .
In addition , syringes are also available from pharmacies , and data from the Czech Republic and Finland allow overall syringe availability to be estimated .
Combining distribution and sales data suggests that , in a year , drug injectors obtain on average 125 syringes in the Czech Republic and 140 syringes in Finland .
The measurement of syringe coverage is an important component of understanding the likely effects of syringe distribution in disease prevention and for assessing unmet needs .
However , it is important to take account of the availability of syringes through pharmacies sales ( prices , density of pharmacy network ) as well as drug injectors " behavioural patterns and environmental factors in interpreting these data .
This issue is further discussed in the 2006 statistical bulletin .
See the 2006 statistical bulletin for technical notes .
A collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project examined mortality among opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations ( 196 ) .
The study found a very high mortality among opioid users compared with their peers : 6 @-@ 20 times higher among males and 10 @-@ 50 times higher among females .
It was estimated that in six of the locations ( Amsterdam , Barcelona , Dublin , London , Rome and Vienna ) 10 @-@ 23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15 @-@ 49 years could be attributed to opioid use , mainly overdoses , AIDS and external causes ( accidents , suicides ) .
mortality 9.5 times higher than in the general population , but with a decreasing trend .
A French cohort study that followed individuals arrested for heroin , cocaine or crack use found that male mortality was five times higher and female
In addition , AIDS related to intravenous drug use accounted for 1 528 deaths in 2002 ( 197 ) , although this is probably an underestimate .
In Europe most cases of opioid deaths are related to heroin , but other
20 1 opioids play a role ( see below ) (
In this section , and in the EMCDDA protocol , the term " drugrelated deaths " refers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and , generally , occurring shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
Other terms used to describe such deaths include " overdoses , " " poisonings , " " drug @-@ induced deaths " or " acute drug

This trend is common in EU @-@ 15 Member States and has been observed since the early 1990s , although in Sweden and the United Kingdom it is less marked .
In new Member States the trend is less clear and a

Methadone deaths and Finland .
The EMCDDA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 203 ) .
Several countries reported the presence of methadone in a substantial proportion of drugrelated deaths in their 2005 Reitox reports .
The terminology used varies between countries , and in some cases it is difficult to determine what role methadone played in the death .
The high mean age in the Czech Republic is related to the inclusion of many deaths due to psychoactive medicaments ( Figure 12 ) .
In many Member States , the age of overdose victims is increasing , suggesting a decrease in initiation to heroin

Based on " national definitions " as presented in methodological notes on drugrelated deaths in the 2006 statistical bulletin .
National trends in drugrelated deaths can provide some insight into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin epidemics and high @-@ risk behaviours ( e.g. injection ) , as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin availability .
They can also , of course , reflect the success of medical emergency services
Other countries did not report methadone deaths or the numbers reported were very small .
Data available from the EU reveal some general trends in drugrelated deaths .
Among the EU @-@ 15 Member States , a sharp increase was apparent during the 1980s and early 1990s , possibly paralleling the expansion of heroin use and injecting .
Drug deaths continued to increase between 1990 and 2000 , although less sharply ( Figure 13 ) .
Buprenorphine and fentanyl deaths
Deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the agonist @-@ antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug .
Since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .

Deaths related to ecstasy started to be reported in Europe during the 1990s as the drug became popular .
Ecstasy deaths cause considerable concern as they often occur unexpectedly among socially integrated young people .
In Europe as a whole , there were references to 77 deaths ,
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
In Spain , ecstasy was present in 2.5 % of drug poisonings .
In countries with a longer series of data , different patterns of drugrelated deaths can be detected .
In other countries , for instance Greece , Ireland , Portugal , Finland , Sweden and Norway , drug deaths peaked later , between 1998 and 2001 , and again subsequently declined .
In other countries , the pattern was less clear or numbers were stable .
Although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .

The issue of the risk of ecstasy use has often been raised .
of 5 @-@ 8 cases and 2 @-@ 5 cases per 100 000 users in the two countries for which this calculation can be made .
Many of these cases may go unnoticed at present because of a lack of awareness .
Further research is needed in this area .
For GHB deaths see Chapter 4 .
Research into the circumstances of overdoses has supported the development of interventions that target high @-@ risk situations or high @-@ risk individuals .
Such measures may achieve an important reduction in the deaths attributable to the immediate effects of drug taking .
The data that do exist indicate that many deaths involving cocaine also involve opioids .
In most countries , expert opinion on the use of different intervention strategies to reduce drug overdose deaths considers opioid substitution treatment to be the most
) Last 12 months " use in population surveys . )
Annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe methadone substitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce overdose deaths .
These ranged from simple information dissemination , through counselling on overdose risks and prevention , to initiation or continuation of substitution treatment in prison .
However , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
In Spain , Italy and the United Kingdom , prison interventions are among the predominant approaches to a reduction in acute drug deaths .
Information , education and communication ( IEC ) -oriented responses are further important measures in most European countries .
However , seven countries ( Estonia , France , Ireland , Latvia , Hungary , Malta , Finland ) use such measures rarely , and one country ( Sweden ) not at all .

Chapter 8Improving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
European drug situation . Increasingly , we are seeing a more complex picture with respect to chronic drug problems in Europe .
The EMCDDA indicator of problem drug use ( PDU ) monitors " injecting drug use or long @-@ duration / regular use of heroin , cocaine and / or amphetamines . "
Included in the definition , by convention , is the use of other opioids such as methadone .
The enlargement of the EU has embraced a greater variety of social behaviours , with illicit drug use no exception .
This definition of PDU is a purely behavioural one based on drug consumption patterns and does not explicitly measure problems in any sense .
Nonetheless , it is linked to the various concepts of addiction by the understanding that someone behaving in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem user . "
• it is relatively easy to operationalise in research studies ;
• it groups together different types of drugs and modes of administration as alternatives , without specifically differentiating between them .
This changing position must be seen against the background of greatly expanded treatment provision for those with opioid @-@ related problems as well as increased reporting coverage of treatment services .
Nonetheless , in many countries it appears that those developing a drug problem today in Europe are likely to be , in terms of the substances they are using at least , more heterogeneous than has historically been the case .
The PDU indicator and counting hidden populations of drug users
Historically speaking , the EMCDDA monitoring indicator was a child of its time - during the 1980s , and to a large extent the 1990s , heroin use and injecting drug use were seen as key components of the drug problem that required estimation .
Furthermore , these forms of drug use could not be measured convincingly by survey techniques .
While the PDU indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem , it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today 's more heterogeneous
In terms of the current implementation of the PDU indicator across the EU , countries have adapted the definition to cover the practicalities of their local situation and the position is therefore heterogeneous .
Other stimulants all clients
Other drugs
NB : Based on data from the Czech Republic , Denmark , Germany , Greece , Italy , Cyprus , Hungary , Malta , the Netherlands , Slovenia , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden , the United Kingdom , Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey.Sources : Reitox national focal points .
Earlier in this report a separate estimate of heroin use and injecting in Europe was provided for the first time .
In addition , we note the increase in treatment availability for opioid problems , with estimates of over half a million opioid substitution treatments in Europe .
This suggests that the proportion of heroin users and injectors having or having had contact with treatment services may be quite large in many countries .
Moving beyond the PDU indicator
A further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorporated into the monitoring exercise , beyond PDU monitoring .
These kinds of indirect statistical methods complement population survey work , which , for a range of methodological and practical reasons , is less suitable for estimating the prevalence of drug use that is of low prevalence , stigmatised and largely hidden .
Addressing this problem requires developing a better understanding of the patterns of polydrug use and applying this to improve national and European @-@ level reporting .
The way forward in this area requires the formalising of the concept of frequent , intensive use of cannabis and other illicit drugs as a specific target for monitoring .
Frequent or intensive use can be measured in survey data to complement its estimation through indirect statistical methods .
Currently , survey data provide a useful window on different patterns of cannabis use , but these are largely restricted behavioural and frequency of use measures .
For instance , this is the case with problem users who use different opioids , as well as pharmaceuticals , cocaine , amphetamines and alcohol .
A number of European countries are working on developing methodological tools for measuring both intensive use and levels of dependence and problems , and the EMCDDA is promoting collaboration in this area of work .
This pattern of use seems to exist among some chronic users , possibly among marginalised groups , possibly among people with psychiatric conditions .
In many recording systems in Europe , these cases will be attributed to opioids .
Under these circumstances , any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include polydrug use as one of these separately measured components .
Although problem opioid use is strongly characterised by daily patterns of use , this is often not the case for stimulant drugs .
The challenge of reporting polydrug use problems
For good practical and methodological reasons most reporting on drug use describes each substance separately .
A second drug with a functional or pharmacological rationale is not confined to simultaneous use but may also be used consecutively , as a replacement or as a complementary drug .
Chapter 8 : Improving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
Increased risks through polydrug use
The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances .
Survey results do show considerable use of more than two drugs by individuals in the same time period .
An example of the extent of polydrug use data available from population surveys can be seen in a recent technical report of the EMCDDA ( 2005b ) .
Limits of the data available on polydrug use
Developing an operational definition of polydrug use : a question of timing ?
The absence of available data limits reporting on many aspects of polydrug use .
Data are available from toxicological reports from drug overdoses and self @-@ reports from those attending treatment services .
While these sources allow some insights into polydrug use , the information available is often limited and the representativeness of the data needs to be considered .
Consideration needs to be given to what time periods are selected for assessing and reporting on polydrug use .
Figure 15 : Use of drugs in the last year by different user groups in the general population aged 15 @-@ 34
0 General population
Cannabis users
Cocaine users
No single reporting instrument can adequately encompass this complexity .
Polydrug use could be usefully defined operationally as the frequent use of more than one substance over a minimum specified time period , for example one month .
As such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
Given that many of the data sources available are based on behavioural reports of drug consumption , the concept of frequent or intensive use needs to be developed on this basis .
This will widen the perspective for monitoring drug problems beyond that currently found in the PDU indicator .
In parallel , work needs to advance on developing reporting standards that enable patterns of polydrug use to be better described at the European level .

Responding to drug problems in Europe - an overview
Opioid use and drug injection
New and emerging drug trends and action on new drugs
Drug @-@ related infectious diseases and drug @-@ related deaths
This is the 12th annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
Like previous reports , it provides a comprehensive update on the current situation regarding drug use in Europe .
It also demonstrates Europe 's achievement in implementing a methodologically sound , sustainable and comprehensive information system to monitor drug use .
enforcement .
It is not hard to find areas that arouse special concern .
Nonetheless , we feel strongly that it is also important to acknowledge progress where it has been made .
In Europe , more and more Member States are adopting strategic and planned approaches to tackling the drugs problem .
There has also been a dramatic increase in investment in prevention , treatment and harm @-@ reduction activities and improved cooperation and increased focus in supply reduction .
Drug use in general remains at historically high levels , but it has stabilised in most areas , and in some areas there are even signs that merit cautious optimism .
The European Union and its Member States give considerable support to international programmes and , in a global context , it is satisfying to observe that , in a number of important areas , the European situation looks relatively positive .
The report addresses two fundamental questions .
What is known about drug use in Europe and the problems it causes ?
And what has been learned about responding effectively to drug @-@ related problems ?
They recognise that the way forward lies in analysing the available evidence regarding both the size and nature of the problem and the costs and benefits of different intervention approaches .
As a result , Europe can be proud that its response to this difficult and often emotive issue is both rational and humane .
As a monitoring agency , we deal in facts and figures ; we are committed to being scientifically rigorous and impartial , interpreting the information available without prejudice or prior position .
This is our role , and as Chairman of the Management Board and Director we accept no compromise on this position and take pride in the high standards we maintain .
But while scientific rigour is essential to our work , we must never forget that behind the figures we report are real human beings whose lives have been affected and sometimes ruined by drug problems .
Behind the dry statistics on treatment demand , drug @-@ related deaths and criminal behaviour are the grieving families , lost potential and children growing up in unsafe communities .
To develop effective responses to the drugs problem requires us to be dispassionate about our data , but we must never become dispassionate about the topic .
In this report we also reflect on the progress that has been made in responding to the drugs problem in Europe .
This is particularly pertinent this year , as both in Europe and internationally we will soon be reflecting on achievements in this area .
In Europe , the drugs situation still represents a serious challenge for health and social policy and for law

Reitox national focal points
Reitox is the European information network on drugs and drug addiction .
The network is made up of national focal points in the EU Member States , Norway , the candidate countries and at the European Commission .
Under the responsibility of their governments , the focal points are the national authorities providing drug information to the EMCDDA .
The contact details of the national focal points may be found at : http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 1596
This annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway ( participating in the work of the EMCDDA since 2001 ) in the form of a national report .
The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2005 ( or the last year available ) .
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
An online version of the annual report is available in 23 languages and may be found at http : / / annualreport.emcdda.europa.eu
The 2007 statistical bulletin ( http : / / stats07.emcdda.europa.eu ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
It also provides further detail on the methodology used and over 100 additional statistical graphs .
Country data profiles ( http : / / dataprofiles07.emcdda.europa.eu ) provide a top @-@ level , graphical summary of key aspects of the drug situation for each country .
Three in @-@ depth reviews accompany this report and explore the following issues :
• Drugs and driving ;
• Cocaine and crack cocaine : a growing public health issue .
The selected issues are available in print and online ( http : / / issues07.emcdda.europa.eu ) in English only .
The national reports of the Reitox focal points give a detailed description and analysis of the drugs problem in each country and are available on the EMCDDA website ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 435 ) .
Europe plays an increasingly important role in supporting global actions to reduce drug problems
Neither trends in the use of drugs nor those who are involved in drug production and trafficking respect national or geographic boundaries .
Moreover , the EU is now the major international donor supporting the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) .
parts of the world is relatively comprehensive and robust information available .
The USA , Canada and Australia can provide meaningful comparison points on estimates for last year drug prevalence .
Estimated cannabis use is , on average , considerably lower in the European Union than in the USA , Canada or Australia .
The prevalence of cocaine use is higher in the USA and Canada than in the European Union and Australia .
Quantifying complexity : setting meaningful targets and developing useful summary measures
While acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
A positive conclusion of this report is that European drug policies are becoming more sensitive to the need to focus on specific activities and develop meaningful targets .
Annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe in this area show promise .
Moreover , it should be borne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
proportion of the prison population in virtually all countries .
The EMCDDA is currently collaborating with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to establish a database for the collection of prison health indicators .
The general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
Not only do many of those entering prison have drug problems , but studies show that drug use often continues in prison .
Harm is also one of the key concepts included in the UNODC 's recently proposed illicit drug index ( IDI ) .
These sorts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the composite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can encompass the target concept .
The new regulation of the EMCDDA emphasises the importance of identifying and disseminating good practice .
A key difficulty here is the real world settings in which demand reduction interventions are applied .
Credible controlled studies , the gold standard for most medical interventions , are often difficult to design or simply impracticable .
The complexities of assessing evidence for effectiveness and identifying quality control standards are addressed in this report .
Cannabis : popularity may have peaked - as recognition of public health issues grows
There are still considerable differences between European countries in the nature and scale of their national drug problems and also in the range and configuration of response .
Despite this , there is considerable agreement on more general fundamentals : that drug policies should be balanced , comprehensive and evidence based .
In the area of demand reduction , the need for prevention , treatment and social rehabilitation activities is accepted by all .
But , historically , the topic of harm reduction has been more controversial .
This is changing , and harm reduction as part of a comprehensive package of demand reduction measures now appears to have become a more explicit part of the European approach .
It is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging Member States to develop and expand harm @-@ reduction activities .
But , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most commonly consumed illicit drug by young and very young people .
Drug use among those who are developing both physically and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompanying selected issue on drug use in minors .
An important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
Although some Member States have introduced schemes to divert offenders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
At a glance - estimates of drug use in Europe possession .
( Note that these estimates relate to the adult population and are the most recent estimates available .
Despite considerable public and media debate on the topic , it is hard to see any direct or simple relationship between law enforcement policies and overall prevalence of cannabis use .
This has produced a more homogeneous European picture now than has historically been the case .
In addition , the most recent data suggest that , particularly in the high @-@ prevalence countries , cannabis use is moving into a more stable phase or even decreasing .
And , although the data are still relatively weak , there is some evidence that the popularity of the drug among the younger age groups is decreasing in some countries .
Although national trends vary overall , it is possible to be cautiously optimistic that the escalation of cannabis use that has been seen in Europe since the 1990s may now have reached its peak .
Over 7 500 acute drug deaths , with opioids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2004 data )
Europe remains the main global market for cannabis resin , most of which is produced in North Africa . Herbal cannabis is also available in Europe ,
Coordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new intergovernmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine interdiction .
Each year , around 400 cocaine @-@ related deaths are reported in Europe , and there is a suspicion that cardiovascular deaths in which cocaine has been an aggravating factor may go largely undetected .
Requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
In 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher proportion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
The number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tripled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
However , overall cocaine treatment requests are lower than those related to cannabis and considerably lower than for opioid problems .
HIV : overall assessment positive , but new infections underline the need for continued efforts
The EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
During the 1990s , the experience , or potential threat , of a widespread HIV epidemic among drug injectors was a catalyst for the development of services for this group .
This figure may be low by historical standards , but it still represents a considerable public health problem .
Increased prevalence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest prevalence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Worryingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @-@ 6 % in 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds ) .
It is important to note that estimates of those experiencing serious problems with cocaine are far lower .
Other indicators also demonstrate an upward trend , confirming the growing importance of cocaine in Europe 's drug problem .
Both quantities and numbers of seizures have increased , perhaps reflecting increased targeting of
As a result , especially in areas where prevalence has been high , the burden of infection resulting from injecting drug use is likely to be decreasing .
The situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
Commentary - the drug situation in Europe concern , but here again most of the recent data point to a relative decrease in new infections .
( HCV ) - including a significant proportion who are no longer using drugs .
Across Europe , HCV rates are high among injecting populations , and studies show that young injectors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @-@ using careers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
This raises the question for Europe : what effect will this increase have on the drug problem ?
Afghanistan - can alternative development measures have an impact ?
The sustainability of the general stable or improving situation seen in heroin use in Europe is called into question by increasing opium production in Afghanistan .
Estimates for 2006 suggest that production increased by 43 % as a result of a substantial increase in the area under cultivation .
Opioid seizures and laboratories dismantled seem to indicate that opium produced in Afghanistan is increasingly being transformed into morphine or heroin in the country itself , before being exported ( CND , 2007 ) .
In the north and north @-@ east of the country , not only have increasing wage rates and falling opium prices deterred poppy planting , but also some high @-@ value vegetables actually generate greater returns than poppies .
In these areas , crop diversification has been supported by counter @-@ narcotics efforts and greater governmental involvement - leading to a general perception that opium prohibition measures will be enforced .
These legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems arising from lack of security .
Reductions in cultivation can be achieved quickly but are reversed equally quickly .
Downward trend in drug overdose deaths tails off
Overdose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoidable mortality among young adults .
of drug treatment data and drug overdoses suggests that the heroin @-@ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
However , this trend has not continued in 2004 and 2005 .
Particularly of concern is the fact that in a few countries the proportion of younger people among those dying has been growing .
Reducing drug @-@ related deaths is an important public health target and the reasons for the faltering in the downward trend needs to be identified .
In Austria , a growing proportion of treatment demand clients are under 25 and are seeking help for problems due to the use of opioids diverted from legitimate uses .
Death by overdose is not the only health risk facing those with drug problems .
Studies reveal that excess mortality from all causes is considerable among problem drug users : as much as 10 times what would be expected in the general population .
Cyprus , Latvia and Romania , have incorporated detailed implementation processes in their drug strategies and action plans .
This approach , which has been in place in other Member States ( e.g. Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
In none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benefited from the experience of earlier ones .
In 2007 , two Member States , Malta and Austria , as well as Norway , are due to adopt new drug strategies , while the Czech Republic , Estonia , France and Hungary will implement new action plans .
In this chapter , drug policies in the EU as a whole and in individual Member States , as well as the relationship between these two levels of policymaking , are described .
A data collection exercise brought forward by the EMCDDA in the reporting period permits an overview of current national drug strategies and institutional frameworks across Europe .
Estimating the cost of drugs to society is discussed in a section on drug @-@ related public expenditure .
Based on data on national public expenditure reported by Member States , a first approximation is made of the total amount spent by European governments on the drugs phenomenon .
Legislative changes focusing on supply reduction and on legal approaches to drug testing are described in a section on recent changes in national laws .
An overview of the latest statistics on drug law offences and trends in offences involving opioids and cannabis are presented in a section on drug @-@ related crime .
The chapter concludes with a section on drug @-@ related research in Europe .
National drug strategies
General situation and new developments
In early 2007 , all EU Member States , except Italy , Malta and Austria , had a national drug strategy , sometimes accompanied by an action plan .
Reducing drug use in general and problem drug use in particular is a key objective of the national drug strategies and action plans of all EU Member States , candidate countries and Norway .
The objective of preventing and reducing the individual and collective harm resulting from the use of drugs is also shared by all countries .
Another common feature is the " comprehensive " approach , whereby interventions aimed at drug supply reduction and those aimed at drug demand reduction are linked .
The " balanced " approach , which aims to give priority both to supply reduction and to demand reduction , is also very widespread .
All these elements are also part of the EU drugs strategy .
A noticeable trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two complementary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
The policy of combining a drug strategy with action plans facilitates more detailed definitions of objectives , actions , responsibilities and deadlines . Some countries , for example
New regulation of the EMCDDA enable the agency to provide a more complete picture of the drug phenomenon .
On 12 December 2006 , the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union signed the recasted regulation of the EMCDDA , which came into force in January 2007 .
Emphasis is also given to the need to develop an information system that is sensitive to new and emerging trends .
The new regulation clarifies the countries to which the EMCDDA can transfer its know @-@ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
The new document broadens the scope of the EMCDDA 's remit .
Particular reference is now made to providing information on the combined use of licit and illicit psychoactive substances and on best practice in Member States .
All these new elements will
The role of the Reitox network of national focal points is more clearly defined in the new document .
The recast also modifies the regulation regarding the Scientific Committee .
This will provide the agency with a cohesive , independent body of eminent scientists .
In addition to helping to ensure the quality of the work of the EMCDDA , it will also provide a bridge to the wider scientific and research community .
Moves towards the integration of licit and illicit drugs policies have been evident in some countries for several years ( e.g. Germany ,
to know if their policies are implemented and if the expected outcomes are achieved .
In two Member States ( Belgium , Slovenia ) , the scope of the evaluation has been limited to a number of selected projects .
In most other countries , and at EU level , the implementation of the actions set out in the national drug strategy is systematically monitored .
This enables progress reviews to be carried out , the findings of which may be used to improve or renew existing drug strategies or action plans .
National drug strategies and action plans generally include interventions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . The extent of the different interventions and the importance given
2 to each of them varies , however , between countries (
Global evaluations , covering process , output , outcome and impact , are less frequent in Europe .
Evaluation
Having in the EU a diversity of national drug strategies with common objectives can be viewed as a strength because it allows comparative analysis of different types of approach .
The EU and its Member States have already invested significant resources in this field .
Almost all European countries mention the objective of evaluating their national drug strategy .
Governments want
There is also some activity in the area of developing indexes designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
See the 2006 selected issue " European drug policies : extended beyond illicit drugs ? . " See Chapter 2 .
Annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Drug policy indexes countries ( e.g. Finland , Portugal ) , coordination at regional or local level is directly supervised by the national coordination bodies .
However , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
This approach will be further developed to enable it to be used in the evaluation of national drug coordination systems .
Drug @-@ related public expenditure
The United Kingdom 's drug harm index ( DHI ) is designed to capture the social costs of harms generated by the problematic use of any illegal drug .
It covers four types of harms : health impacts , community harms , domestic drug @-@ related crime and commercial drug @-@ related crime .
The UNODC 's illicit drug index ( IDI ) combines three dimensions of the drug phenomenon : drug production , drug trafficking and drug abuse .
The conceptualisation of both instruments has involved interesting methodological developments and has allowed a first insight into the use of overall indexes to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
A first observation is that such instruments can be useful for a longitudinal follow @-@ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be contextualised with the analysis of individual indicators within the indexes .
Coordination mechanisms
Nevertheless , some general features can be described .
At the regional or local level , drug coordination agencies and / or drug coordinators exist in most countries .
Six countries provided detailed information of expenditure associated with tackling drugs ( Table 1 ) .
In other
This figure is likely to underestimate the full extent of drug @-@ related public expenditure , given the high level of under @-@ reporting . The six countries included in Table 1 account for 76 % of the total public expenditure reported by EU Member States
The public expenditure perspective
Studies on the costs of drug use can be an important source of information for the development and management of drug policies .
The analysis of a State 's public expenditure provides useful information regarding the ability of its government to spend effectively and efficiently. ciently .
Drug @-@ related costs can be divided into two major categories : direct and indirect .
Direct costs are those for which payments are made , and typically include expenditure in the areas of prevention , treatment , harm reduction and law enforcement .
Indirect costs are the value of productive services not performed because of drug use , and typically consist of lost productivity due to drug @-@ related morbidity and mortality .
The estimation of drug @-@ related public expenditure is a different exercise from that of estimating social costs .
Direct public expenditures explicitly labelled as " drug @-@ related " can be initially traced back by exhaustively reviewing official financial reporting documents ( e.g. budgets or year @-@ end reports ) .
Estimations are complicated when drug @-@ related expenditures are not labelled as such but embedded in programmes with broader goals ( e.g. overall police operations budget ) .
In this case , direct non @-@ labelled drug @-@ related expenses must be calculated through modelling approaches .
Drug @-@ related social costs are the total of all the costs to society , direct and indirect , caused by drug use .
The output , expressed inmonetary terms , is an estimate of the total burden that drug use places on society ( Single et al . , 2001 ) .
Determining the social cost of drug use has several benefits .
First , it reveals how much society is spending on drug @-@ related issues and , implicitly , the amount that would be saved if drug use were completely abolished .
Second , it identifies the different components of cost and thesize of the contribution of each sector in society .
Such informationcan help to determine funding prioritiesby highlighting areas where inefficiencies may exist and savings can be made .
The primary aim of social cost calculations is to weigh the burden that drug problems pose on society against the cost to society of addressing these problems ( including possible indirect effects ) .
Ultimately , this leads to the question of effectiveness and efficiency : do governments spend their money wisely on the right problems ?
However , some authors ( Reuter , 2006 ) have proposed that , for policy purposes , public expenditures are more relevant than social costs .
and Norway . Based on the data supplied by these six countries , the total drug @-@ related public expenditure by European countries is calculated to lie somewhere between
In addition , as of 2005 , the EC and the Member States had co @-@ financed drug @-@ related assistance projects in third countries to the value of over EUR 750 million .
At EU level , considerable funding will be provided by the European Commission to tackle the drugs issue under the new 2007 @-@ 13 budget .
Other new financial instruments , such as the prevention of and fight against crime programme ,
In response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 , the EMCDDA is currently working towards developing a methodology that will enable the Member States , candidate countries and Norway to compile standardised data on drug @-@ related expenditure .
This will help the EMCDDA to estimate both the total public expenditure allocated to drugs and how this is divided between different activities .
Of the six countries , four ( Hungary , the Netherlands , Finland and Sweden ) provided detailed modelled approaches of their figures .

EU legal and policy developments
At the end of 2006 , the European Commission presented its first progress review ( 5 ) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) .
This assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan 's objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled .

The drug programme is still being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council , in view of its adoption under the co @-@ decision procedure .
Reports on the social cost of drug use
In June 2006 , the European Commission issued a Green Paper on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union ( 6 ) , as laid down in the drugs action plan .
The aim of the Green Paper is to explore how best to organise a continuous dialogue with civil society organisations active in the drugs field .
Data on the social cost of drug use are reported by only a small number of countries .
The social cost of illicit drug use was estimated at EUR 907 million in France in 2003 and at EUR 29.7 million in Luxembourg in 2004 .
In 2004 , an average 290 drug couriers per month were arrested , decreasing to 80 per month by early 2006 .
Drug testing regulation
In Ireland , substantive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 , which sets out new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour and proposals to strengthen imposition of the 10 @-@ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EUR 13 000 or more .
Procedures regarding the drug testing of drivers are further described in the 2007 selected issue on drugs and driving .
This is stated to be in the interest of good order , safety , health and security , and would be carried out on samples of urine , oral fluids and / or hair .
Procedures regarding the use of certain tools to combat drug trafficking were also established or improved .
In Estonia , the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and Associated Acts was amended in May 2005 to widen the scope of surveillance .
In Romania , a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use , as well as measures to improve judicial cooperation , surveillance and cross @-@ border pursuit and transfer of legal procedures .
In Bulgaria , the new Penal Procedure Code introduced in October 2005 regulates controlled delivery , confidential transactions and undercover investigations .
There are also provisions for the temporary protection of witnesses in drugs cases and , in some circumstances , for protecting the identity of witnesses , as well as special rules for the questioning of such witnesses and use of undercover officers .
In Norway , it is no longer the case that drug testing in the workplace can be carried out provided an employee or job applicant gives consent .

Drug @-@ related crime
the Netherlands , Turkey and Norway , drug law offences related to dealing and trafficking are predominant , with these offences accounting for up to 92 % ( the Czech Republic ) of all drug law offences reported in 2005 .
In the Czech Republic , methamphetamine @-@ related offences predominated , accounting for 53 % of all drug law offences , while in Luxembourg cocaine was the most reported substance ( implicated in 35 % of drug law offences ) .
In all reporting countries except Luxembourg and the Netherlands , cannabis is the drug most often involved in offences for use / possession for use .
Data on " reports " ( 8 ) of drug law offences are routinely available in all the European countries analysed in this report .
In addition , there are variations between national information systems
The term " reports " for drug law offences is given in quotation marks because it describes different concepts in different countries ( police reports of suspected drug law offenders , charges for drug law offences , etc . ) .
For an exact definition for each country , refer to the methodological notes on drug law offences in the 2007 statistical bulletin .

Drug @-@ related research in Europe , as reported by national focal points , is financed through national and European public funds .
In Romania , research is funded through international organisations , such as the Global Fund .
Research activity of hepatitis C @-@ positive drug users , is quoted particularly often in the German report , whereas the Dutch report focuses on new treatment methodologies .
The few references to neuroscientific research are primarily Dutch ; however , the French MILDT has also financed a series of research projects in this area .
Taking peer @-@ reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries .

Drugs and driving - EMCDDA 2007 selected issue
Psychoactive substances can impair a person 's ability to drive a car to the extent that the risk of accidents and injuries is increased .
This selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( http : / / issues07.emcdda.europa.eu ) .
EU funding for drug @-@ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @-@ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
The EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 specifically calls on Member States to increase the provision of effective and diversified methods of prevention , treatment , harm reduction and social reintegration that are easily accessible .
These facets of the drug problem in Europe will be discussed in more detail in this chapter .
Germany , the Netherlands and Norway have extended information coverage .
Greece , Cyprus , Lithuania and Italy monitor school @-@ based prevention , while in Greece , Poland , Sweden and Finland , community @-@ based prevention services are under study , and France has set up a centralised system to monitor drug prevention .
Some countries ( the Czech Republic , the autonomous region of Galicia in Spain , Hungary and Norway ) are already focusing on the evidence base when funding for interventions is applied for , and are considering introducing accreditation systems .
Portugal , Finland and Romania have minimum quality criteria for prevention programmes .
Most prevention programmes are not evaluated .
Those that are evaluated are usually assessed in terms of the " scope and the acceptance of the intervention " rather than " the extent to which the objectives have been achieved " ( Greek national report ) .
Prevention strategies can be targeted at different groups - ranging from total populations to specific risk groups - and the methods applied vary accordingly .
Treatment and harm @-@ reduction measures are also available to drug users and drug addicts , and in a considerable number of countries their effectiveness has been evaluated through outcome studies .
Harm @-@ reduction measures aim to prevent drug @-@ related deaths and to reduce health @-@ related harm , for example HIV or hepatitis C infections .
Heroin dependence is usually treated with substitution therapy , and special programmes have been developed for cannabis , amphetamine and cocaine dependence .
And , in the event of successful treatment , the next step is social reintegration .
As will be described below , the living conditions of many drug users are poor and social reintegration strategies often have to overcome considerable problems .
For each type of intervention , examples are given from different countries and research results in support of their effectiveness , or otherwise , are discussed .
These are helpful in defining good practice in prevention strategies .
In the sections below , the effectiveness of different types of prevention strategy is discussed , based on the results of this study and others .
The effects of individual prevention strategies cannot , in general , be measured by changes in population @-@ level prevalences of drug use .
However , every prevention strategy can be compared against the accumulated body of evidence , to determine whether or not it is an evidence @-@ based intervention .
This requires good information on the content , coverage and number of prevention interventions .
Improving the available information : monitoring , quality control and evaluation
Member States are increasingly monitoring prevention interventions and , as a result , are delivering data on the
Criteria commonly used to determine whether an intervention can be considered an evidence @-@ based practice are efficacy and effectiveness ( Brown et al . , 2000 ; Flay et al . , 2005 ) .
As a consequence , conclusions about what works can differ .
It remains a challenge to determine how to evaluate and weigh the different sources of evidence in the decision @-@ making process .
This will be even more difficult in the case of interventions for which a comprehensive evidence base has not yet been established but the experience of which would suggest may be effective .
Efficacy is a measure of how well an intervention works under ideal research conditions .
Unfortunately , however , the random allocation of participants to either an intervention or control group is not always feasible .
Effectiveness is a measure of how well an intervention works in ordinary circumstances .
Frequently , interventions that have shown promise in controlled trials are implemented in the community to investigate how well they work under routine conditions .
mass media campaigns ) to the provision of social @-@ emotional information ( trying to change perceptions about , for example , cannabis use ) .
For example , in the Netherlands a campaign put across the message " You are not mad if you are not smoking cannabis , because 80 % of all young people
14 do not smoke either " (
It has , however , been found to raise information levels and to lend support to policy initiatives . "
However , other evidence suggests that mass media campaigns can have positive effects if used as a supporting measure to reinforce other strategies ( Bühler and Kröger , 2006 ) .
national drug prevention campaign in Ireland seek to dispel some of the myths that surround cannabis , such as claims that it is " organic " and " natural . "
Environmental strategies on licit substances
In an evaluation of Scotland 's " Know the score " cocaine campaign , Binnie et al .
In a few isolated cases , however , there has been a shift in emphasis from knowledge enhancement ( the aim of most
Annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe programmes focuses on raising awareness , providing information and organising isolated events ( such as expert
16 ) , despite evidence which suggests that other visits ) ( methods may be more effective .
Social influence programmes in schools are widespread , particularly in the United Kingdom and in countries offering standardised programmes , such as Germany , Ireland , Greece , Spain , Norway and , soon , Denmark .
Such strategies are aimed at reducing consumption among young people , creating alcohol @-@ free zones or increasing security in nightlife settings .
The introduction of school norms is now receiving greater consideration in Germany , Ireland and Italy ( 15 ) .
Universal prevention
As regards universal community @-@ based prevention , 12 Member States report that drug plans are available in most or all municipalities , and in 10 countries they are a political priority .
Such schemes principally take the form of information events and , to a lesser extent , the provision of alternative leisure @-@ time pursuits .
Universal family @-@ based prevention mostly consists of parents " evenings or information approaches , and infrequently in intensive training for parents .
Member States are increasingly devoting attention to prevention strategies targeted at entire vulnerable
This seems to have been achieved in almost all Member States .
Once target communities have been identified ( e.g. France recognises " sensitive urban zones " or , in the case of schools , " educational priority zones " ) , supplementary funds can be directed towards these underprivileged groups .
In Ireland , Cyprus and the United Kingdom , selective prevention projects are already delivered to most of these areas , and Portugal is in the process of implementing such a strategy .
Types of provision range from counselling services in Estonia , Greece , France and Slovakia to outreach projects in Luxembourg and Austria , sometimes aimed specifically at ethnic groups .
Furthermore , some new Member States ( Bulgaria , Hungary , Lithuania , Poland and Romania ) report much on interventions aimed at vulnerable families .
The focus in most Member States is on substance use in the family , although a few countries ( Greece , Lithuania , Hungary , the United Kingdom ) have adopted a broader focus aimed at all socially disadvantaged families .
A reason frequently given for not implementing model programmes is that they would not be adaptable to local conditions and would not address individual communities " needs ( Ives , 2006 ) .
In many Member States ( Bulgaria , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Austria , Romania ) the content of prevention

Characteristics of drug users attending outpatient treatment
It seems that such approaches may be more effective at changing knowledge and attitudes than in changing behaviour .
access to outpatient treatment is easier and less selective in most countries , it is appropriate to extrapolate from this group of clients to drug users as a whole .
Although selective prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in peer @-@ to @-@ peer programmes ( Cho et al . , 2005 ; Dishion and Dodge , 2005 ) , because negative " contagion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
These unintended effects , which are caused by the intervention itself , can lead to increased substance use or risk behaviour .
Approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
Recent developments in treatment systems
Most treatment of drug users takes place in outpatient settings , including general practice .
About 80 % of outpatient treatment clients are male , with a mean age of around 30 years ( 28 years among those new to treatment ) , and their living conditions are generally poor compared with the general population of the same age .
Around 60 % of outpatient clients have not achieved a level of education beyond primary , and about one tenth of those clients have not even completed primary education .
Countries in which national geographical coverage of specialised drug treatment facilities is very patchy include Latvia , Hungary , Slovakia and Romania .
Despite recent expansions of the network of service providers , waiting lists for substitution treatment continue to exist in Greece as well as in Hungary and Poland .
Information on the socio @-@ economic situation of drug clients in treatment is complemented by national information from some countries broken down by main substance used .
New developments
Residential services are , however , of growing importance in the care of elderly and long @-@ term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the coexistence of serious somatic and psychological co @-@ morbidity .
The philosophy of inpatient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
) See the TDI tables and graphs in the 2007 statistical bulletin for more details on the figures quoted in this section .
Legal frameworks of substitution treatment pharmacological treatment options have been expanded to meet the needs of specific user groups with the aim of increasing treatment coverage .
For example , buprenorphine maintenance treatment is now licensed in Malta ( 19
Results were obtained from 17 countries and complemented a 2003 report from the
European legal database on drugs ( 1 ) .
The scope of the legal framework varies considerably between Member States .
There is a trade @-@ off between strength of the framework and flexibility. flexibility .
Member States are increasingly acknowledging the importance of providing adequate treatment services for problematic cannabis and cocaine users .
In the case of cannabis , treatment , counselling and prevention programmes in Europe are often intertwined in order to reach a large number of users .
New communication strategies , for example making use of the Internet , are being implemented in an attempt to reach cannabis users whose drug use falls somewhere between experimental and problematic .
The substances that can be used for substitution treatment are normally designated by law .
In most cases , only methadone and buprenorphine or only methadone can be prescribed , although in a few countries other drugs such as morphine or codeine are permitted .
Similarly , in almost all countries national admission criteria are laid down either in laws or in ministerial decrees or guidelines .
The most common criteria are diagnosis of addiction and minimum age , although the need for previous unsuccessful drug @-@ free treatment also features .
In some countries , sanctions for violating treatment rules are set out in national laws while in others the issue is at the discretion of each individual treatment centre .
Treatment of heroin dependence
After political endorsement as a response to heroin use in the second half of the 1980s , substitution treatment has gone on to become the predominant option for the treatment of opioid dependence in most countries ( Figure 2 ) .
The laws usually also define who is permitted to prescribe .
This is primarily doctors in treatment centres , though in some countries any doctor or certain trained or accredited doctors may prescribe .
In practice , it is rare for doctors outside treatment centres to initiate substitution treatment ( 2 ) .
Maximum doses are rarely defined in law .
To prevent duplicate prescriptions , most countries use special prescription forms , though a central register is found in several countries and a few issue special ID cards .
Authorised dispensaries are usually also specified in the legislation , mostly pharmacies or treatment centres , though some countries also allow doctors to dispense .
Finally , in most countries , a system for taking doses home has been established by law , guidelines or simply tolerance , but occasionally this is specifically forbidden .

The main substitution drugs used are methadone and buprenorphine .
Ideally , pharmacological treatment should be combined with psychological counselling and social support .
Substitution treatment is usually delivered in outpatient settings at specialised drug treatment units but increasingly also by doctors in private practice .
In some countries , e.g. Germany , France and the United Kingdom , general practitioners are heavily involved in treating drug users .
In others , the level of involvement of community @-@ based medical doctors is still limited , either for legal reasons or because of a lack of interest in addiction treatment ( 20 ) .
Quality control has also been on the agenda in several countries , resulting in regulations being tightened , training requirements increased

It appears to be particularly influential among the countries that joined the EU in 2004 .
Precarious housing , irregular employment and a history of imprisonment are indicators of social exclusion that characterise the life of numerous drug users .
Care systems are therefore challenged to find novel responses to new client profiles , often characterised by multiple needs .
Social reintegration is now established as an important determinant of long @-@ term treatment success .

In some countries , the reintegration sector is receiving increasing political attention and investment , and in several countries standards for drug maintenance treatment envisage that social care and reintegration services should be made available to clients .
In addition , Greece , France , Italy , Lithuania , Austria , Portugal and Slovakia participate in the Commission 's EQUAL initiative in the area of employment and social inclusion ( 24 ) .
This report documents that harm reduction is a defined public health objective at national level in all Member States .

National treatment outcome studies
An important feature of the studies is that they investigate treatment outcomes in existing services under day @-@ to @-@ day clinical circumstances .
Common treatment modalities examined include methadone maintenance , methadone reduction , detoxification and drug @-@ free interventions such as therapeutic communities and counselling .
Drug use , physical and psychological health , retention in treatment and criminal behaviour are the main outcome variables used .
Programmes and actions in many countries are not specifically aimed at drug users but address vulnerable social groups in general and are typically implemented at local or regional level .
Similarly , local governments in Poland have a legal obligation to socially reintegrate drug users , and in the Netherlands most new social reintegration services are initiated by municipalities .
In Italy , the Vedette study ( 1998 @-@ 2001 ) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment offered in public treatment centres across the country .
Retention in treatment and mortality among heroin users were the main outcome variables .
To date , three treatment outcome studies have been instituted in the United Kingdom .
The first was the National Treatment Outcome Research Study ( NTORS ) , carried out by the National Addiction Centre in England and Wales between 1995 and 2000 .
It investigated treatment outcomes in residential or community treatment programmes .
There were some positive findings , such as increased rates of abstinence from illicit drug use , a reduction in the frequency of drug use , a reduction in crime and improved health .
Housing assistance ranges from emergency day shelters , hostels and short @-@ term residential facilities to half @-@ way flats , assisted accommodation and rent subsidies .
To avoid " locking " clients into longer @-@ term service dependence , innovative approaches in the area of supported housing or financial management are being explored .
An update of the NTORS study will be provided by the Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study ( DTORS ) being carried out at the University of Manchester .
The study started in 2006 and will follow drug users from across England for an initial 12 months .
It aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment pathways produce the best outcomes for particular subgroups of drug users .
In Scotland , the Drug Outcome Research Study ( DORIS ) , being carried out by the University of Glasgow , started in 2001 .
This study examines the impact and effectiveness of drug treatment services based at treatment agencies , including prison @-@ based services .
Drug users were followed up for up to 33 months .
However , it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self @-@ esteem , status and a regular rhythm of life .
New ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises , mentoring schemes and providing incentives such as subsidising trainees " wages or giving business start @-@ up loans .
In several countries , drug treatment facilities have started their own socio @-@ economic enterprises , gainfully employing their clients .
Other initiatives focus on improving the employment situation through better matching of profiles , expectations and skills with the realities of work life .
It also helps to identify solutions for clients for whom occupational reintegration is no longer an option .
However , a large centralised residential facility to accommodate 120 homeless drug users with psychiatric problems met with local objections .
For those with mental health problems , professional help to re @-@ establish a network of support and contact persons is identified as an important component of the social reintegration process .
The reintegration of marginalised , ageing heroin users with high levels of somatic and mental illness poses a particular challenge .
In the Netherlands , a new Social Support Act was adopted in 2007 , including drug addiction under the same regulations as ( other ) chronic psychiatric
In some countries ( e.g. Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , structured reintegration programmes are provided only as a follow @-@ on from successfully completed abstinence @-@ based drug dependence treatment , and specific reintegration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
Interpreting seizures and other market data
Introduction : the changing picture of cannabis use in Europe
Quantities seized may fluctuate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seizures are very large .
In all countries , the number of seizures includes a major proportion of small seizures at the retail ( street ) level .
Where known , origin and destination of drugs seized may indicate trafficking routes and producing areas .
The price and purity / potency of drugs at retail level are reported by most of the Member States .
However , data come from a range of different sources , which are not always comparable , making accurate comparisons between countries difficult. cult .
Cannabis is the world 's most commonly used illicit drug and a substance that has been at the centre of the drugs debate in Europe since the 1960s when its use became virtually synonymous with a growing youth counterculture .
Despite this familiarity , understanding the patterns of cannabis use in Europe is a complicated task .
One important element in this picture is the different cannabis products now available on the European market . Historically , three main forms of cannabis have been common in Europe : cannabis resin ; herbal cannabis ; and , far less frequently , cannabis oil .
For many , the smoking of cannabis resin with tobacco remains the usual route of administration for the drug , though , elsewhere in the world , this pattern of use is relatively uncommon .
While Europe remains the dominant global market for cannabis resin , herbal cannabis products appear to be becoming more common and predominate in some markets .
In recent years , this picture has grown more complicated still with the increasing availability of cannabis produced within Europe ; some of which is grown under controlled conditions and can be of relatively high potency .
This kind of cannabis has become a specific product in its own right in many countries and complicates the assessment of the public health impact of changing patterns of cannabis consumption .
Supply and availability
In order to view European drug seizures in a wider context , in this report summary information is presented on the global situation .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime produce an annual report on the international drug situation and this is the principal source used for the world estimates included here .
The reader should note that there are difficulties in compiling information of this sort and , in many parts of the world , information systems are poorly developed .
Therefore , these data should be viewed as the best approximations possible from the information resources currently available .
Because cannabis can be grown in a range of different environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , it is extremely difficult to produce convincing estimates of global production .
Cannabis is now frequently distinguished from other illicit substances either in the law , by prosecutorial directive , or by the judiciary practice .
In most European countries , the move has been away from custodial sentences and towards fines , cautions , probation , exemption from punishment and counselling .
Directives to police or prosecutors were issued in : Belgium in 2003 and 2005 , France in 2005 , and the United Kingdom in 2004 and 2006 .
In 2006 , the Czech Republic almost established different classes for non @-@ medicinal drugs , but that draft of the Penal Code was rejected for unrelated reasons .
If cannabis resin in Europe tends to be a fairly uniform product , the same cannot be said of herbal cannabis .
The origin of seizures reported in 2005 includes Albania , the Netherlands , countries of the former Yugoslavia , Angola and South Africa .
Although domestic production of herbal cannabis is difficult to monitor systematically , in 2005 , it was noted in half of the reporting countries .
Some cannabis produced in Europe is grown outdoors and can be considered virtually indistinguishable from imported herbal cannabis .
In 2005 , global seizures of cannabis resin totalled 1 302 tonnes as compared to 4 644 tonnes of herbal cannabis ; both totals were down on the 2004 figures .
Western and central Europe continued to account for the bulk of resin seized ( 70 % ) , while quantities of herbal cannabis seized remained concentrated in North America ( 64 % ) ( UNODC , 2007 ) .
An estimated 303 000 seizures of cannabis resin amounting to 909 tonnes were made in Europe in 2005 ( 25
The cannabis debate remains contentious and considerable disagreement remains over the relative costs and benefits of different public health and criminal justice responses .
This is reflected in the fact that not all measures have gone in the direction of easing penalties and , in some countries , penalties have been made more severe or the current situation is under critical review .
However , this was not true for the quantity of resin intercepted , which fell in 2005 , after increasing in the period 2000 @-@ 04 .
Cannabis policy remains an issue that generates considerable public discussion and disagreement .
This can be seen in the findings of the recent Eurobarometer survey ( 2006 ) , which asked European citizens if they agreed with the statement that personal consumption of cannabis should be legalised throughout Europe .
Just over two thirds ( 68 % ) of those asked disagreed and around a quarter ( 26 % ) agreed with this proposition .
In all countries , although the proportion of those sampled that favoured continued prohibition varied , it was always the majority view .
For a fuller discussion see the ELDD topic overview : http : / / eldd.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 5036
) The data on European drug seizures that this section is based on can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 and SZR @-@ 4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
This should be checked against missing 2005 data when available .
For estimating purposes , 2005 missing data were replaced by 2004 data .
young people increased in virtually all countries . However , some of the more recent data suggest that the upward trend is levelling off , albeit at historically high levels .
In 2005 , an estimated 13 500 seizures in Europe resulted in the interception of about 24 million cannabis plants ( most of them in Turkey ) and 13.6 tonnes of cannabis plants ( most of it in Spain ) .
Overall , the number of seizures of cannabis plants in Europe shows a continuous upward trend since 2000 .
Price and potency
Details of the EMQ are included in " Handbook for surveys about drug use among the general population " ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 1380 ) .
However , there are still differences between countries in methodology and year of data collection , and small differences between countries should be interpreted with caution ( 1 ) .
As surveys are expensive to conduct , few countries collect information annually .
In this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available , which in most cases will be between 2003 and 2006 .
However , reported average or typical prices for both types of cannabis ranged from EUR 2 per gram to over EUR 15 .
Mean prices of cannabis resin , corrected for inflation , fell over the period 2000 @-@ 05 in all reporting countries except Poland , where prices remained stable .
Mean prices of herbal cannabis , corrected for inflation also decreased or remained stable over the same period in all reporting countries except Slovenia ( 28
Three measures of drug use over time are commonly used for reporting survey data . Lifetime use or prevalence is the broadest .
EMCDDA standard age ranges : all adults ( 15 to 64 years ) and young adults ( 15 to 34 years ) .
Data from some countries cover slightly different age ranges ( e.g. 16 @-@ 64 , 18 @-@ 64 , 16 @-@ 59 years ) .
For more information about methodology of population surveys and the methodology used in each national survey , see the 2007 statistical bulletin .
The more recent survey data confirm the picture of cannabis use as the most frequently used illicit substance in Europe .
During the 1990s , the use of the drug , particularly among
Data on cannabis potency can be found in Tables PPP @-@ 2 and PPP @-@ 5 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
Annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using cannabis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in cannabis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
30 of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds (
National figures vary from
Despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
If attention is restricted to young people in the 15- to 24 @-@ year age range , prevalence estimates for lifetime use range between 3 % and 44 % ( with most countries reporting figures in the range 20 @-@ 40 % ) .
Last @-@ year prevalence rates range from 4 % to 28 % ( in most countries 10 @-@ 25 % ) ; and last month prevalence rates are between 1 % and 19 % ( in most countries 5 @-@ 12 % ) .
Among males in this age group , prevalence estimates are higher still .
Patterns of cannabis use
Moving the point of reference from lifetime to last year , the levels of reported cannabis use fall but still remain considerable .
Estimates suggest that more than 23 million European adults have used cannabis in the last year , producing an average figure of about 7 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Again , despite the wide overall range , 13 out of the 25 countries that provided information reported last year prevalence estimates between 4 % and 9 % ( Figure 3 ) .
As noted above , the use of cannabis , as with most other illegal drugs , is notably higher among younger people , although even here considerable country variation can be found .
Use is also notably higher among males than among females , although this difference tends to be less pronounced for young people .
Estimates of last month prevalence will include people using cannabis more regularly , although not necessarily in an intensive way .
It is estimated that 13.4 million Europeans adults used the drug in the previous month , on average about 4 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Country figures range between 0.5 % and 8.7 % .
The lowest figures were reported by Bulgaria , Malta , Lithuania and Sweden , and the highest from Spain ( 8.7 % ) , Italy ( 5.8 % ) , the United Kingdom ( 5.2 % ) and France ( 4.8 % ) .
Of the 26 countries that provided information , figures from 13 countries fall within the range 2 % to 6 % ( 33 ) .
For many , cannabis use tends to be discontinued after a short experimental period and rates of use generally decline as individuals grow older .
Tracking the careers of cannabis users in the available data and identifying changes over time in consumption patterns is , however , difficult .
Some insight into this issue can be gained by comparing reported lifetime use with more recent consumption measures .
) The average proportion was computed as the average of national prevalence rates weighted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
Total numbers were computed by multiplying prevalence among the population concerned in each country and , in countries for which no information was available , imputing the average prevalence .
Figures here are probably a minimum , as there could be some under @-@ reporting . )
In this text , the United Kingdom figures are based on the 2006 British Crime Survey ( England and Wales ) , due to practical reasons .
There are additional estimations for Scotland , Northern Ireland and a combined estimation for the United Kingdom is available ( presented in the 2007 statistical bulletin ) . )

The EMCDDA is currently working closely with a number of Member States on the development of a better methodological approach to this issue .
It is planned that this estimation can be updated in the near future .
Another important information need in this area is to better understand the factors associated with discontinuing use .
) There is as yet no universally accepted definition of " intensive cannabis use . "
It is , however , a broad term meaning use of cannabis that exceeds a certain threshold of frequency .
It does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
In this chapter , figures refer to " daily or almost daily use " ( defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days ) .
This benchmark has often been used in studies and can be derived from the European model questionnaire .
Ongoing methodological studies ( national and EMCDDA ) will help to understand better relationships between intensive / frequent use and problems ( see box on developing psychometric scales , p . 42 ) .
In France , a " regular consumer " is defined as using the drug " 10 times or more in the last 30 days " ( 4.3 % of adult males , 1.3 % of adult females ) .
In the United Kingdom , " frequent use " is considered " use more than once per month in the last year , " and is not comparable with measures used in this section .
Developing psychometric scales to identify intensive , dependent and problematic cannabis use in survey data there are important temporal differences between countries and waves of popularity observable in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 1960s ( 38 ) .
An example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Reitox national report ) where a relatively high level of experimentation was reported in the 1970s among conscripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 1970s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
Descriptions on drug use from surveys are based on self @-@ reported behaviour over different time intervals .
Historically , daily use has not been monitored systematically , in part because in most countries the prevalence of cannabis use was low .
And , the approach of restricting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any precision .
However , as cannabis use has increased across Europe and concerns about cannabis problems have grown , this approach has had to be reconsidered .
In fact , nearly all EU countries now collect information on how many days the drug has been used in the month prior to interview .
Based on this information , it is estimated that around 3 million people may be using cannabis daily or almost daily .
However , this still provides only a blunt tool for identifying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of cannabis .
An example here is the United Kingdom , which in general terms often appears to be a " frontrunner " in respect to drug @-@ use trends .
During the early 1990s , the United Kingdom stood out as a high @-@ prevalence country , reporting on most measures the highest prevalence figures in Europe .
However , last year prevalence levels among young adults ( 16 @-@ 34 ) stabilised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.0 % to 16.3 % ) .
Levels of cannabis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom prevalence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
In the Czech Republic , a country with high prevalence rates , trends are difficult to assess within the data available - although the information for young adults suggests that prevalence levels may have fallen slightly .
40 in Estonia , Germany , Hungary , Slovakia and Norway (
Tracking trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence in many countries of reliable time series data .
However , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .

See Figure GPS @-@ 4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
In Sweden the situation appeared stable and slight decreases were noted in the other four surveys .
42 cannabis use is usually in outpatient settings (
Some , though , do use cannabis in combination with other drugs , most often alcohol ( 37 % ) and amphetamines or ecstasy ( 28 % ) .
After alcohol ( 38 % ) , cannabis is reported as the second most frequently cited secondary substance by those receiving treatment ( 43 ) .
Overall , the general picture emerging from the school survey data reflects that found in adult surveys .
As a point of contrast , Greece , Cyprus , Romania , Sweden , Turkey and Norway all report lifetime prevalence estimates lower than 10 % . % .
However , there are interesting variations between countries , with cannabis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . For the remaining countries , in 12 the proportion of

cannabis clients is between 5 % and 20 % and in seven it is between 21 % and 29 % .
Compared to the other drug clients , people entering treatment for primary cannabis use have the highest proportion of males and the youngest age ( mean age 24.5 years ) .
However , in the last three years , indications of an increase in the age of new cannabis clients are reported ( 48 ) .
Overall , cannabis clients can be divided into three groups : those who use it occasionally ( 34 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 27 % ) and those using it daily ( 39 % ) .
The increase in the demand for cannabis treatment does not appear to have a simple explanation .
There are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
In addition , as discussed below ,

Although the extent to which this is a problem remains unclear , it remains an important question for planning services in this area .
Responding to cannabis problems
In some of the programmes , the orientation is as much towards prevention and harm reduction as towards the treatment of drug problems .
France provides an example of a specialised service for cannabis users where 250 cannabis consultation centres have been created in 2005 .
Quasi @-@ compulsory interventions
Identifying those at risk and intervening early is recognised as an important component of all drug programmes , and teaching staff may be among the first to identify cannabis among their pupils .
Germany , Italy and Poland all have developed programmes for teachers that help them respond to cannabis use and seek specialist help when this is appropriate .
For cannabis users referred from court services , treatment interventions are not the only kind of response noted .
New communication strategies for engaging with cannabis users
No strong evidence base exists to inform cannabis treatment practice , and research studies in this area are limited and mainly based on American and Australian experiences .
In Europe , the most common reported approaches to cannabis problems include : short @-@ term outpatient services , counselling , school @-@ based programmes and outreach prevention activities .
Generally , interventions appear to be based on brief @-@ intervention approaches using a combination of motivational interviewing and cognitive @-@ behavioural elements .
Although no strong consensus exists on what constitutes effective practices , some studies have suggested this kind of approach can be useful .
One European initiative in this area is the Incant project , where Belgium , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Switzerland have cooperated on exploring the value of multidimensional family therapy ( MDFT ) with cannabis users .
Concerns have been raised that it may be inappropriate to treat young cannabis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
A number of innovative programmes in Europe attempt to exploit new communication tools for engaging with cannabis users .

In Denmark , SMASH is an anonymous support and counselling project for young cannabis users , intended to reduce the harmful effects , provide information and support to help them stop smoking cannabis ( 52
The project is based around subscription to two SMS packages .
The first of these ( hashfacts ) provides factual information about cannabis use and the second offers support and motivation to those attempting to stop taking drugs .
Young people can also receive personal coaching via text messages to help them stop or reduce their use of cannabis .
A similar service exists in Ireland , although the emphasis is on information dissemination .

Ecstasy refers to synthetic substances that are chemically related to amphetamines but which differ to some extent in their effects .
The best @-@ known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) , but other analogues are also occasionally found in ecstasy tablets ( MDA , MDEA ) .
The prevalence of ecstasy use in the EU has been increasing since the 1990s .
In many European countries , the second most commonly used illicit substance is some form of synthetically produced drug , although on a European scale , there are now more users of cocaine .
The use of these substances among the general population is typically low , but prevalence rates among younger age groups are significantly higher , and in some social settings or cultural groups the use of these drugs may be particularly high .
Globally , amphetamines ( amphetamine and methamphetamine ) and ecstasy are among the most prevalent synthetic illicit drugs .
Historically , lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) has been by far the best @-@ known hallucinogenic drug , but overall consumption levels have been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time .
Recently , evidence of increased availability and use of naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances , hallucinogenic mushrooms in particular , has emerged .
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants .
Of the two drugs , amphetamine is by far the more commonly available in Europe whereas significant methamphetamine use appears to be restricted to the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
Supply and availability ( 53 )
Amphetamine and methamphetamine : differences and similarities
Amphetamine seized in Europe is reported to come mainly from Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland , and to a lesser extent from Estonia and Lithuania .
Both substances are central nervous system stimulants , which share the same mechanism of action , behavioural effects , tolerance , withdrawal and prolonged use ( chronic ) effects .
Globally , 12.9 tonnes of amphetamine was seized in 2005 , most of it in two regions : western and central Europe and east and south @-@ east Asia .
Amphetamine and methamphetamine products mostly consist of powders , but ice , the pure crystalline hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is also used .
Tablets containing either amphetamine or methamphetamine may carry logos similar to those seen on MDMA and other ecstasy tablets .
Given the physical forms in which they are available , amphetamine and methamphetamine may be ingested , snorted , inhaled and , less commonly , injected .
Unlike the sulphate salt of amphetamine , methamphetamine hydrochloride , particularly the crystalline form ( ice ) , is sufficiently volatile to be smoked .
In 2005 , an estimated 40 300 seizures of amphetamine , amounting to 6.6 tonnes , were made in Europe .
Until 2004 , the United Kingdom has consistently accounted for the greatest number of seizures and the largest quantities of amphetamine intercepted in Europe .
Despite some fluctuations , at European level , both the overall number of amphetamine seizures and quantities seized have increased since 2000 ( 54 ) .
In 2005 , however , a majority of reporting countries recorded a downward trend in the number of amphetamine seizures made . This picture
Data on seizures and quantities seized of amphetamine , ecstasy and LSD are not available for all countries for 2005 ; see the seizure tables in the 2007 statistical bulletin for more information . )

International action against the manufacture and diversion of drug precursors
The average or typical retail purity of amphetamine in 2005 varied considerably , but most European countries reported purities between 15 % and 50 % ( 56 ) .
All data below come from the INCB report on precursors ( INCB , 2007b ) .
Global methamphetamine production was estimated at 278 tonnes in 2005 .
It is mostly manufactured in east and south @-@ east Asia and in North America .
In 2005 , global potassium permanganate seizures were the largest ever reported to the INCB with 16 countries intercepting 183 tonnes , almost all of which was seized outside Europe .

Prevalence and patterns among the general population and youth
In terms of measures of recent use , ecstasy is now the most commonly used synthetic drug in 17 European countries , and amphetamines in nine ( 63 ) .
Ever in lifetime prevalence of about 16.3 million ecstasy tablets in Europe in 2005 ( 59 ) .
The largest quantities of ecstasy continue to be seized in the United Kingdom , Belgium , the Netherlands and Germany .
After a peak in 2001 , ecstasy seizures made in Europe have been on the increase again since 2003 .
The total amount of ecstasy intercepted has been fluctuating at around 20 million tablets per year between 2000 and 2004 .
In 2005 , however , the available data show a decrease in the quantities of ecstasy seized in a majority of countries .
This picture should be confirmed against 2005 data from the United Kingdom when available .
In 2005 , the average or typical retail cost of ecstasy tablets ranged from less than EUR 3 per tablet to EUR 15 ( 60
Over amphetamines tends to be higher , reflecting the more recent emergence of ecstasy on the illicit drug market in Europe .
Data from school surveys suggest that use by school students of ecstasy , amphetamine and psychotropic drugs other than cannabis cluster among a few individuals .
Among EU Member States , use of amphetamines or ecstasy appears to be relatively high in only a few countries : the Czech Republic , Estonia and the United Kingdom ; and , to a lesser extent in Latvia and the Netherlands .
In Europe , most ecstasy tablets continued in 2005 to contain MDMA or another ecstasy @-@ like substance ( MDEA , MDA ) , usually as the only psychoactive substance present .
In 10 Member States , such tablets accounted for more than 80 % of the total number of tablets analysed .
The MDMA content of ecstasy tablets varies greatly between batches ( even between those with the same logo ) both between and within countries .
In 2005 , the average or typical content of MDMA per ecstasy tablet ranged from 2 to 130 mg in reporting countries , although in most countries the average was between 30 and 80 mg of MDMA .
After a continuous decrease for several years , both numbers of seizures and quantities of LSD intercepted have been on

On average , 5.1 % of young European adults have tried amphetamines ( 67 ) .
Last year use in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 2.9 % , with Estonia ( 2.9 % ) , the United Kingdom ( 2.6 % ) and Latvia ( 2.4 % ) reporting the highest prevalence rates ( Figure 5 ) .
It is notable that , when last year use is considered , the figures from the United Kingdom and Denmark are more in line with those of other countries .
It is estimated that , on average , 1.5 % of young European adults have used amphetamines in the last year .
Historically , methamphetamine use in Europe use has been concentrated in the Czech Republic and to some extent Slovakia .
Recent estimates of problem methamphetamine use are reported by two countries ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia ) .
In other parts of Europe , significant methamphetamine use is not reported .

This kind of approach is of particular relevance to prevention work in settings that are culturally associated with drug taking .
The high prevalence of drug use in some recreational settings , such as clubs , bars and dance events means that these locations have been identified as appropriate targets for drug demand reduction initiatives .
The need to further develop prevention activities in recreational settings is also noted in the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) .
In all countries , except Greece and Sweden , the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary use of amphetamines and ecstasy is greater than the proportion of

One approach has been to make information material that may have prevention and , sometimes , harm @-@ reduction messages available in recreational settings .
Material is usually developed in a user @-@ friendly style that reflects the youth culture of the target group , and is sometimes distributed through mobile outreach teams .
Clients entering treatment for use of stimulants other than cocaine are on average around 27 years old ( 26 if they enter treatment for the first time ) and used the drug for the first time at an average age of 19 ( 83 ) .
Ecstasy clients are , along with cannabis users , the youngest group entering drug treatment .
In the Netherlands the highest proportion of women in drug treatment is reported among the ecstasy clients .
Amphetamines clients usually consume the drug in combination with other substances , mainly cannabis and alcohol , and in some countries injecting is commonly reported ( 85
In addition , to responses that aim at informing and persuading individuals not to use drugs , an increasing number of Member States are also developing approaches to better regulate recreational environments .
Some of these approaches , including running explicitly drug @-@ free events , have attempted to alter the beliefs held by some that drug use facilitates their leisure activities .
For example , safe clubbing guidelines , such as those developed in the United Kingdom ( 86 ) , are now being produced in a number of countries .

Prevalence and patterns of cocaine use
The main point of entry in Europe remains the Iberian peninsula , with Portugal appearing to be increasingly important .
Cocaine is also directly imported into other countries , with the Netherlands remaining a key entry point .
Both Spain and the Netherlands are regarded as main distribution centres for the drug .
Imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversifying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
In 2005 , an estimated 70 000 seizures of cocaine , amounting to 107 tonnes , were made in Europe .
Most seizures of cocaine continue to be reported in western

Prevalence of cocaine use , as it is with other illicit drugs , is concentrated among young adults ( aged 15 @-@ 34 ) .
Overall , the use of crack in Europe remains relatively uncommon and is concentrated among marginalised and excluded subpopulations in some cities .
However , cocaine smokers do represent a significant proportion of treatment demands , although they remain in the minority .
Among those not injecting other drugs , the injecting of cocaine does not appear to be common , even among treatment clients ( see below ) .
However , there have been increasing reports of heroin injectors also injecting cocaine , or cocaine and heroin mixtures .

However , it should be noted that last year and last month prevalence levels of cocaine use are much lower .
Use of cocaine is not confined to certain social groups , but use of the drug by socially integrated young adults in recreational settings can reach higher levels than those reported in general population surveys .
Studies targeting dance music settings in several European countries revealed lifetime prevalence of cocaine use ranging from 10 % to
Analysis of data for countries with longer time series and appreciable prevalence rates can allow detection of trends within subgroups of the population .
In both Spain and the United Kingdom , the increase in prevalence was generally greater among males than among females .
The reported increase in last year cocaine prevalence in Spain since 2001 can be attributed to increased levels of use in the 15 @-@ 24 age group , rather than across 15 @-@ 34 year olds as a whole .
Patterns of cocaine use vary greatly between different groups of users .

A recent evaluation of service provision in the United Kingdom also reported some positive outcomes among crack cocaine clients in residential care ( Weaver , 2007 ) .
Most European countries report that cocaine users can access information about cocaine and the risks of cocaine use through various information sources such as websites , helplines and through other media .
It is interesting to note that the European Foundation of Drug Helplines reports an increase in the number of calls related to cocaine during 2005 and 2006 ( 114 ) .
The needs of these three groups are likely to be different and require different approaches from service providers .
Most reported cocaine treatment in Europe takes place in outpatient settings , which in many cases will be orientated to the needs of opioid users .
It is questionable how attractive such services are to relatively well @-@ integrated cocaine users who have developed problems through their recreational use of the drug .
And it is likely that a proportion of this group will seek help either through generic healthcare providers , such as general practitioners or counsellors or , if they are able , through private specialised clinics .
In contrast to opioid treatment , pharmacological options for cocaine treatment are limited , although prescribing can be helpful in providing relief for related symptoms .
Although small in number , crack cocaine users are likely to be at particularly high risk of experiencing problems and may be difficult to engage in treatment and other services .

Heroin supply and availability ( 115
There are also reports of heroin from south @-@ west Asia being smuggled to Europe via countries in south and east Asia ( India , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , China ) .
In 2005 , 342 tonnes of opium , 32 tonnes of morphine and 58 tonnes of heroin were seized worldwide .
Asia ( China , Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan ) continued to account for the greatest quantities of heroin ( 54 % ) seized worldwide , followed by Europe ( 38 % ) ( UNODC , 2007 ) .
Heroin consumed in Europe is predominantly manufactured in Afghanistan , which remains the world leader in illicit opium supply , followed by Myanmar .
It is estimated that about 6 610 tonnes of opium was produced in 2006 , 92 % of which in Afghanistan .
This represents a 43 % increase compared to the 2005 estimate , due to a substantial increase in the area under cultivation .
Global potential production of heroin was estimated at 606 tonnes in 2006 , up from 472 tonnes in 2005 ( UNODC , 2007 ) .
Opioid seizures and laboratories dismantled seem to indicate that opium produced in Afghanistan is increasingly being converted into morphine or heroin before being exported ( CND , 2007 ) .
An estimated 52 000 seizures resulted in the interception of about 16.8 tonnes of heroin in the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway in 2005 .
Seizures of heroin show an overall decline between 2000 and 2003 and , based on data available , have been increasing since then .

Annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
This translates into some 1.5 million ( 1.3 @-@ 1.7 million ) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway .
However , these estimates are far from robust and more extensive data are required .
Detecting trends in both price and purity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 118 ) .
Most countries reported average or typical street price of brown heroin in the range EUR 35 @-@ 80 per gram .
Between 2000 and 2005 mean heroin prices , corrected for inflation , appear to have decreased in most of the 18 countries providing comparable data .
The mean purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most of the 18 reporting countries since 2000 .
A lack of reliable historical data complicates the assessment of trends over time in problem opioid use and trends should thus be interpreted with caution .
Reports from some countries suggest that problem opioid use may , on average , have stabilised somewhat in recent years .
Data from repeated estimates on problem opioid use for the period between 2001 and 2005 are only available from eight countries and provide a relatively stable picture with only one country ( Austria ) showing a clear increase ( 120 ) .
Moreover , as most studies are based on a localised geographical area , such as a city or district , extrapolation to generate national estimates is difficult .
Estimation is also complicated as patterns of problem drug use in Europe appear to be becoming more diverse .
Recent estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 .
In comparison , the full PDU prevalence is estimated to be between one and eight cases per 1 000 .
In Finland , heroin also appears to have been largely replaced by buprenorphine among new opioid treatment demands and buprenorphine is increasingly mentioned in reports on overdose deaths .
In the few countries where problematic use of amphetamines is reported , well @-@ documented estimates are available .
Estimates of problematic cocaine use are scarce and the PDU indicator is , except in few high @-@ prevalence countries , likely to be less reliable for this drug . ) See Figure PDU @-@ 4 ( part ii ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin .

This would mean there may be around 1.1 million ( 0.9 @-@ 1.3 million ) injectors in the EU and Norway today .
These are predominantly opioid injectors , although they may inject other drugs as well , and some countries report a significant amphetamine or methamphetamine injecting problem ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) .
Trends in injecting drug use from treatment demand data
The proportion of injectors among all primary heroin users entering drug treatment ( 2001 @-@ 05 ) shows marked differences in levels of injecting between countries .
An exception is Estonia , where a much higher estimate of 15 cases per 1 000 has been reported .
Of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .

It should be noted that trends in injecting in non @-@ heroin users may be different .
Treatment of opioid dependence
Over the past 15 years , the provision of treatment for heroin dependence has seen large increases in the EU .
According to available data , this is mainly due to a more than sevenfold increase of substitution treatment provision in the EU @-@ 15 Member States , since 1993 .
Maintenance treatment
Generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
) See Tables HSR @-@ 7 , HSR @-@ 9 and HSR @-@ 11 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
Many countries have taken these concerns seriously , and Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom all report that reviews are under way with the objective of improving the quality of care provided .
Similarly , Denmark has recently completed a three @-@ year project to document the impact of wider psychosocial support in substitution treatment and to test quality assurance processes .
One reason for interest in the use of buprenorphine is that it is arguably a more suitable pharmaceutical option than methadone for use in community practice .
This issue is a complex one and is discussed in detail in the 2005 selected issue on buprenorphine .
Buprenorphine is marketed in the form of sublingual tablets , and although it is not considered a particularly attractive substance to inject , reports exist that tablets have been dissolved and injected .
The potential for misuse of buprenorphine is supported by reports from some countries of the diversion of the drug onto the illicit market .
To deter illicit use of buprenorphine , a new formulation of the drug , in combination with naloxone , has been developed .
This formulation , Suboxone , received a European marketing authorisation in 2006 .
The availability of national clinical guidelines , standards and treatment protocols is important in ensuring the quality of substitution treatment .
In the Netherlands , maintenance treatment is now increasingly realised according to medical treatment standards , and administration of methadone is supervised during the first phase of treatment .
A national monitoring system for reporting on clients in substitution treatment programmes also provides information useful for assessing the quality and availability of services .
Overall , the number of clients receiving heroin in Europe is very small , and treatment is usually reserved for particularly chronic cases where other therapeutic options have proved unsuccessful .
The efficacy of heroin as a substitution agent has also been explored in experimental research in both Spain ( March et al . , 2006 ) and Germany ( Naber and Haasen , 2006 ) .
Together with earlier work , these studies on heroin prescription have stimulated debate about the need for this treatment option to be more widely available .
Information available from the treatment demand indicator ( TDI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requesting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 123 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
The European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for European marketing authorisation for medicinal products .
Medicines approved through the centralised procedure obtain a single marketing authorisation which is valid in all Member States of the European Union .
All authorised medicinal products are also monitored for safety .
This is conducted through the EU network of national medicines agencies , in close cooperation with healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical companies themselves .
In many countries , opioids , mainly heroin , remain the principal drug for which clients seek treatment .
Some countries report a significant proportion of treatment demands relating to opioids other than heroin .
In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , around 4 % of clients are reported as primary methadone users .
In Spain , Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 7 % of drug clients are entering treatment for primary use of unspecified opioids other than heroin or methadone ( 125 ) .
And in Hungary , where the use of home @-@ made opium poppy products has a long history , around 4 % of treatment requests are related to opium .
The EMCDDA collects two types of information to describe treatment in Europe .
The treatment demand indicator is based on the monitoring of characteristics of clients entering treatment across Europe .
In addition , Member States are asked to provide data that describes the overall structure and availability of services .
Data from the treatment demand indicator
Most opioid users are reported by outpatient treatment units ; however , in Sweden 71 % of opioid clients are reported by inpatient centres , indicating that services are differently structured in this country .
A small percentage ( 3 % ) of inpatient treatment demands for opioid clients is also reported by the United Kingdom ( 126 ) .
In the few countries reporting data on treatment demand in low @-@ threshold agencies , a significant proportion of drug clients seek treatment for primary opioid use ( 127 ) .
See Table TDI @-@ 114 in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
See Table TDI @-@ 119 in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
In the EU Member States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug substitution treatments was at least 585 000 . This estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service availability .
For EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
Results show significant differences between countries , with rates varying from under 10 % ( Slovakia ) to about 50 % of opioid users ( Italy ) .
However , the data does suggest the need to review the availability of treatment options in all countries in order to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet estimated needs .
This represents a more than sevenfold increase since 1993 , when substitution cases were estimated to be around 73 000 ( Farrell , 1995 ) .
In 2005 , stabilisation in the number of clients in substitution treatment was reported in the Netherlands ( 122 cases per 100 000 inhabitants ) and Luxembourg ( 355 cases per 100 000 ) .
The proportion of clients seeking treatment for opioid use varies between countries .
Based on the most recent data available , opioid users make up 40 @-@ 70 % of all treatment demands in 12 countries , less than 40 % in seven countries and more than 70 % in six countries ( 130
The percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreasing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . The only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
United Kingdom ( 131 ) .
These increases coincided with a geographical expansion of the availability of substitution treatment option in many of these countries .
In two countries with a history of high levels of provision , Spain and Malta , provision has recently decreased , possibly reflecting overall levels of demand in these countries .
The interrelationship between repeat treatment demands , maintenance levels and the prevalence of problem opioid use is complex .
The levels of clients " repeat treatment demands and the numbers of clients in drug maintenance programmes is determined by historical developments in opioid use incidence and prevalence , as well as treatment service organisation and type .
For a few countries , it
The absolute decrease of new opioids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the proportion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .

See Figure TDI @-@ 3 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .

Studies have compared the physiological and subjective effects of BZP with those of amphetamine , and suggest that BZP has approximately one tenth of the potency of dexamphetamine .
Emerging drugs trends often mimic , expand on , or substitute previously popular drug trends and raise questions about why psychoactive substances are being consumed .
BZP in combination with TFMPP ( 136
) , are thought to be designed to mimic ecstasy 's effects .
These products usually are visibly labelled as piperazine @-@ containing , but are often misrepresented as " natural " or " herbal . "
In the context of an inevitably partial picture , the accumulated information about emerging drug trends in Europe is assessed by triangulating information from a wide range of different sources .
Furthermore , perceived safety of BZP is fostered by the fact that the products are often sold by designated retailers or in specialised shops rather than on the street .
BZP has been encountered in 14 EU Member States ( Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Ireland , Greece , Spain , France , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal , Finland , Sweden , the United Kingdom ) and Norway .
The most significant development relating to new psychoactive substances in recent years is the spread of various novel piperazine derivatives , a number of which appeared in Europe between 2004 and 2006 .
There are , though , no fatal cases that can be directly attributed to BZP . In March 2007 , the EU responded to rising concern over the use of BZP by
This group of synthetic substances is derived from the parent compound piperazine and includes BZP ( 1 @-@ benzylpiperazine ) and mCPP ( 1- ( 3 @-@ chlorophenyl ) piperazine ) .
mCPP their legislation addressing psychotropic substances .
GHB has been used therapeutically in anaesthesia in France and Germany , and in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in Austria and Italy .
It might be assumed that the addition of mCPP is intended to potentiate or ameliorate the effects of MDMA .
GHB is easily manufactured from its precursors gamma @-@ butyrolactone ( GBL ) and 1,4 @-@ butanediol ( 1,4 @-@ BD ) , solvents widely used in industry and commercially available .
Because GBL is not controlled in most Member States and online chemical suppliers offering it provide an easy access , some GHB users appear to have switched to consuming GBL .
Qualitative analyses of online GHB and drug forums based in the United Kingdom , Germany and the Netherlands suggest that users obtain GBL from chemical suppliers who market GBL for various legitimate purposes .
Open Internet sales of GHB ( 138
Drug facilitated sexual assault
All information sources available suggest that general prevalence of GHB use is low , with significant levels of use limited to some specific subpopulations .
An Internet survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that GHB was more commonly used within the home ( 67 % ) compared with nightlife environments ( 26 % ) ( Sumnall et al . , 2007 ) .
Cases of sexual assault by means of covertly adding a drug to a drink in order to incapacitate a victim have been increasingly reported in the media and medical literature since the 1980s .
However , forensic evidence for this type of crime is notoriously difficult to obtain .
A lack of information makes trends in GHB use difficult to assess , although the available evidence suggests that use of GHB remains limited to some small subpopulation groups .
Data from dance music surveys from Belgium , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom suggest that use of GHB may have peaked around 2000 @-@ 03 and declined subsequently .
However , the extent to which this finding would apply to other subgroups is unclear .
) See http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / ? nnodeid = 1346 ) The term GHB is used to include the possible use of GBL or 1,4 @-@ BD . )
Compared with other substances , a high proportion of GHB cases ( 84 % ) required transportation to a hospital .
GHB information requests to the National Poisons Information Centre in the Netherlands increased by 27 % ( constituting 241 of the 1 383 requests made ) in 2005 compared with 2004 .
In 2004 , over a third of young people in the EU stated that they would turn to the Internet if they wanted to know more about drugs ( Eurobarometer , 2004 ) .
If young people do go online seeking drug information , a real question arises as to the extent to which the information they access will be unbiased and accurate .
Numerous sites cover drug use issues , some of them government @-@ sponsored , others run by lobby groups , consumer or advocacy networks .
In addition to acting as a source of information on drugs , the Internet has created a marketplace for both licit and illicit drugs , with sites offering for sale illicit drugs and legal alternatives .
Teams that provide first aid support for drug and alcohol problems are increasingly deployed at large events to respond to incidents involving GHB or other drug @-@ related .
Within the framework of the E @-@ POD ( European perspectives on drugs ) project , the EMCDDA is exploring ways to use the Internet as a source of information on emerging drug trends .

Following this review , in March 2007 , the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs draft resolution on responding to the
The main health risk associated with the use of GHB appears to be the high risk of loss of consciousness , especially when the drug is combined with alcohol or other sedative drugs .
GHB use can also result in other problems including coma , decrease in body temperature , hypotonia , hallucinations , nausea , vomiting , bradycardia and respiratory depression .
Physical dependence to GHB has been observed following prolonged use , and additional health risks may be posed due to the possible presence of solvents or heavy metal contaminants .
In Amsterdam , the reported number of non @-@ fatal emergencies due to the use of GHB was 76 in 2005 , exceeding , as in previous years , the medical emergencies attributed to use of
Surveillance of drug @-@ related infectious diseases among IDUs in Europe is currently focused on HIV / AIDS and viral hepatitis ( B and C ) .
However , while the data provided by either of these two systems should be interpreted with caution , taken together , they provide a more complete picture of recent epidemiological trends .
The available data suggests that , by 2005 , in most countries , rates of new infection related to IDUs were low .
A caveat to this analysis is that in several high @-@ prevalence countries , recent case reporting data is not available ( Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria ) .
In 19 Member States , most of which have never experienced large HIV epidemics among IDUs , rates of reported IDU @-@ related cases remained under five cases per million population in 2005 .
Higher figures were reported by Ireland and Luxembourg , with 16 and 15 new cases per million respectively .
In Latvia , Lithuania and probably also in Estonia , rates of reported new IDU @-@ related infections have strongly declined since the epidemic peaks in 2001 @-@ 02 , although they are still high in comparison with most other countries .
In Latvia , the rate has dropped from 283 new cases per million in 2001 to 49 per million in 2005 .
In Lithuania , after an outbreak among prisoners , a peak observed in 2002 ( 109 per million ) has been followed by a decrease to 25 new cases per million in 2005 .
Although there has been a strong decline in HIV infection in Estonia , the country still reports the highest rate of new HIV infections in the EU .
And , while IDU @-@ specific data are not available for Estonia , drug injecting is likely to remain a major transmission route for HIV in this country .
HIV prevalence among young and new IDUs
An important indicator of the number ( incidence ) of new infections among injecting drug users is provided by case reports of newly diagnosed HIV infections .
In interpreting this data , a number of considerations should be borne in mind : infected IDUs may not be diagnosed if they are not in contact with health services ; new infections may not necessarily be attributed to drug injection ; and , the number of cases
Support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analysing levels of HIV infection in samples of new IDUs ( those injecting less than two years ) and young IDUs ( those under age 25 ) .
Figure 11 : Estimates from national and subnational studies of HIV prevalence among injecting drug users , 2004 / 05
NB : Black square = sample with national coverage ; blue triangle = sample with subnational ( including local or regional ) coverage .
Estimates for Spain and Sweden include 2006 data ; data for Ireland and Latvia are from 2003 ; data for Slovakia are from 2003 / 04 .
Countries are presented by order of increasing prevalence , based on the average of national data or , if not available , of subnational data .
Comparisons between countries have to be interpreted with caution owing to different types of settings and study methods ; national sampling strategies vary - see Figure INF @-@ 3 in the 2007 statistical bulletin for further information .
All reported sample sizes are larger than 50.Sources : Reitox national focal points .
For primary sources , study details and data before 2004 , see Table INF @-@ 8 ( part i ) and ( part ii ) and Table INF @-@ 0 ( part i ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
Overall , these local or national level increases in HIV prevalence suggest that complacency concerning the provision of prevention measures to IDUs should be avoided .
in mind that the size of these subsamples is , in general , small and that HIV seroprevalence data on young and new IDUs is not available from some countries .
Trends in HIV prevalence
Increasing HIV prevalences in repeated samples of IDUs may also indicate ongoing infections - although declines in mortality of infected IDUs or decreasing numbers of uninfected IDUs can be important confounders .
Most available time series for the EU show stable prevalence , suggesting that the numbers of infected IDUs dying are balanced by the numbers of IDUs contracting HIV infection .

In the annual report , only samples of size 50 and larger are reported .

Among young IDUs ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high prevalence ( over 40 % in at least one sample ) was found in seven countries and among new IDUs , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United
Only five countries reported studies where prevalence was less than 25 % . % .
The number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV among injecting drug users is estimated to be currently around 3 500 per annum in the EU .
AIDS incidence and access to HAART
The prevalence of markers for HBV infection varies to a greater extent than that of HCV markers , possibly due to differences in vaccination levels .
The most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis core antigen ( anti @-@ HBc ) , which indicates a history of infection .
In 2004 @-@ 05 , prevalence rates of over 40 % were reported from six countries .
) , although specific data for IDUs are not available . AIDS incidence data remains important as it indicates the level of symptomatic disease and the introduction and availability of HAART .
Time trends in notified cases of hepatitis B and C show different pictures .
In the case of hepatitis B , the proportion of IDUs among all notified cases appears generally to have declined , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes . No general trend is visible for the proportion of IDUs among notified cases of hepatitis
Preventing infectious diseases
In addition , total AIDS mortality ( most likely largely related to injecting drug use ) has not declined between 1997 and 2002 , suggesting that access to HAART may have been low during this period ( 146 ) .

See Figure INF @-@ 6 ( part vii ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
The most vulnerable sections of the population suffer disproportionately from these conditions .
Among prison populations , in particular , drug problems are often common and levels of infectious diseases relatively high .
Moreover , drug use often continues or , sometimes , is initiated in prison ; and in this setting , high @-@ risk behaviours can be common .
For the prevention of hepatitis A and B , vaccination has an important role to play .
For those who are drug @-@ dependent , treatment programmes in prison can provide an opportunity that may benefit not only the individual 's health , but may also reduce the likelihood of future offending .
The EMCDDA is involved in the joint development of the database together with WHO Europe and the European Network on Drugs and Infections Prevention in Prison ( Endipp ) ( 1 ) .
Drug treatment and harm @-@ reduction services also need to develop responses to the risks posed by the sexual behaviour of their clients .
Currently , work to motivate pharmacists to get involved in syringe programmes and to support those who are is only reported by France , Portugal and the United Kingdom .
The distribution of other sterile equipment such as alcohol pads and dry wipes , water , filters and cookers together with clean syringes is becoming a general approach among service providers .
While the distribution of sterile injecting material through NSPs is generally no longer regarded as a controversial issue , not all countries prioritise these programmes , and some consider pharmacy sales as largely sufficient .
The geographic coverage of NSPs and the provision of injecting material through them vary greatly between countries .
However , a growing number of countries have nationwide networks of NSPs .
Portugal estimates that its pharmacy @-@ based and outreach NSPs cover about 50 % of the territory , and in Denmark , 10 of the 13 counties run NSPs .
The nature and range of provision of sterile injecting material vary between countries .
In general , syringe provision outlets are located in specialised drugs agencies , and in all but three countries this type of provision is complemented by mobile services that can reach out to groups of drug injectors in marginalised neighbourhoods .
Syringe vending machines complement the available NSP services in 10 countries ( 152 ) , but data on turnover are scarce and research about the effectiveness of this type of provision is lacking .
Luxembourg has now joined Spain and Germany among the few countries offering needle and syringe exchange in prisons ; although provision in Germany is limited to one prison in Berlin .
Between 2003 and 2005 , increases in the total number of syringes exchanged or distributed through specialised NSPs were reported by several countries ( Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Austria , Slovakia ,

Annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Drug @-@ related deaths and mortality
Drug @-@ related deaths
The EMCDDA definition of drug @-@ related deaths refers to those that are caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs .
The number of deaths from other causes indirectly related to drug use ( e.g. hepatitis , violence , suicide or accidents ) is more difficult to assess .
Mortality related to other forms of drug use ( e.g. cocaine ) would add to this figure , but is more difficult to quantify .
" drug @-@ induced deaths " and " acute drug deaths " ( 155 ) .
The number of drug @-@ related deaths in a community will depend on the number of people using drugs associated with overdose ( particularly opioids ) .
Other factors that will also be important include : the proportion of injectors , prevalence of polydrug use , availability and policy of treatment services and emergency services .
Determining the overall level of mortality resulting from problem drug use at a national or European level will require advances in data collection and analysis .
An attempt at such an exercise on a national scale is reported in the Dutch national report .
By extrapolating data from a local study , the mortality rate due , directly and indirectly , to problem drug use was estimated , taking into account regional differences .
Acute deaths related to opioids
Although the comparability of European data has improved in recent years , differences in the quality of reporting between countries still mean that direct comparisons should be made with caution .
The extent of drug @-@ related deaths can be expressed in terms of the number of cases reported , by population rates or by proportional mortality .
These figures should be considered as a minimum estimate ( 156
Opioids are present in most cases of acute drug @-@ related deaths due to illegal substances reported in the EU , accounting for 46 % to 100 % ( Figure 12 ) , mainly heroin or its metabolites .
In Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
See Tables DRD @-@ 2 ( part i ) , DRD @-@ 3 and DRD @-@ 4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
As most cases reported to the EMCDDA are opioid overdoses , general characteristics of acute drug @-@ related deaths are used for description of opioid cases . )
The Czech Republic , Denmark , Germany , Latvia , Malta , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal and the United Kingdom .
Figure 12 : Proportion of acute drug @-@ related deaths that show presence of opioids
( 1 ) For the Czech Republic , the EMCDDA Selection D definition of acute drug @-@ related death was used instead of the national definition .
The national definition includes poisoning by psychoactive medicines , which accounts for most cases ( 156 cases out of 218 ) .
( 2 ) Office of National Statistics definition.NB : In some countries , the " National definitions " of drug @-@ related death include a limited number of cases of deaths indirectly related to drug use .
Data for 2005 or last year for which information is available .
For further information , see Table DRD @-@ 1 in the 2007 statistical bulletin.Sources : Reitox national reports ( 2006 ) , taken from national mortality registries or special registries .
mean age at overdose death is lowest in Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , and Romania and highest in Poland , Finland and the United Kingdom .
There are very few reported overdose deaths among people aged less than 15 years , although drug deaths in this age group could be under @-@ reported .
While some drug @-@ related deaths are recorded among those aged over 65 years , only seven countries report more than 5 % of cases in this age group .
In many Member States , the age of overdose fatalities is increasing , suggesting a decrease in the incidence of heroin use among young people .
This trend is common among the EU @-@ 15 Member States , although in Austria and Luxembourg decreases have been observed in recent years .
In the other Member States , the trend is less clear , and the small numbers of cases makes it difficult to interpret the figures ( 164 ) .
) See Table DRD @-@ 1 ( part i ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin . )
See Figures DRD @-@ 3 and DRD @-@ 4 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
Deaths related to cocaine
( 2004 ) ; and , in Norway , 55 autopsies revealed traces of methadone .
Other countries did not report methadone deaths or the numbers were very small .
Overdose deaths due to cocaine are more difficult to identify than those caused by opioids , and are often considered to be the result of a combination of causes , rather than from cocaine toxicity itself ( 166 ) .
In Europe , reports of deaths with cocaine involved usually also mention the presence of other substances ( including alcohol and opioids ) , reflecting the use of cocaine in combination with other drugs .
Among the countries supplying data , over 400 cocaine deaths were identified in both the 2006 and 2005 national reports .
There is a clear need to investigate further the health consequences and mortality related to cocaine use .
Trends in acute drug @-@ related deaths
Deaths due to buprenorphine poisoning appear to be rare , which is attributed to the agonist @-@ antagonist pharmacological characteristics of this drug .
However , some deaths have been reported by European countries .
In the 2006 and 2005 national reports , only France and Finland recorded deaths related to this substance .
In Finland , buprenorphine was found in 83 cases in 2005 ( 73 in 2004 ) , generally combined with benzodiazepines , sedatives or alcohol , or injected .
In France , only two fatal overdoses involving buprenorphine were reported in 2005 ( four in 2004 ) .
In addition to France and Finland , in 2004 , three other countries reported deaths mentioning buprenorphine ( two or three in each case ) .
National trends in drug @-@ related deaths can provide insights both into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country and into developments in responses .
Data available for the EU reveal some general trends in drug @-@ related deaths .
Drug deaths continued to increase between 1990 and 2000 , although less sharply .
) Depending on country , figures refer to 2004 or 2005 , for ecstasy and cocaine . )
See the 2007 selected issue on cocaine for a more detailed report on deaths related to this drug . )
See Table DRD @-@ 2 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
Figure 13 : Overall trend in acute drug @-@ related deaths , 1996 @-@ 2005 for all Member States with available data account for a decreasing proportion of overdoses ( 170 ) .
Gender differences are also observable in trends in

Several possible causes have been
A collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
suggested to account for this recent increase , among which are polydrug use by opioid users , or a possible increase in the availability of heroin .
There is a marked discrepancy in trends in drug @-@ related deaths between the EU @-@ 15 Member States and those who have joined since 2004 .
In the new Member States , a sharp increase was observed until 2002 , but decreasing in 2003 @-@ 04 .
Increases in the proportion of drug @-@ related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia , Luxembourg and Austria , and to a lesser extent in Latvia and
Suicide is identified as a cause of drug overdose deaths in some studies among drug users .
In 2003 , 13 % of all drug @-@ related deaths were suicides

See Figure DRD @-@ 6 in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
Co @-@ morbidity and Isadora project
Psychiatric disorders are commonly related to problematic drug use .
The most common disorders diagnosed among those dependent on drugs include personality disorders , depression , antisocial personality , anxiety , and mood and eating disorders .
Schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies are also mentioned .
Similarly , drug dependence is common among people with serious mental illness .
The European project Isadora ( " integrated services aimed at dual diagnosis and optimal recovery from addiction " ) was concluded in 2005 after a three @-@ year research period ( 1 ) .
Easier accessibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches , including substitution treatment , improve rates of retention in treatment , which makes an important contribution to reducing drug @-@ related deaths and mortality .
A longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
In the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
Continuity of care with social support and treatment services can play an import role here , especially for those leaving prison .
Research suggests that concurrent use of other drugs , particularly alcohol and sedative drugs , may increase the risk of fatal opioid overdose and , therefore , polydrug use is an important issue for services to address .
This approach has not been widely developed in Europe to date , but may have potential .
An approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , whereby drug users may consume their drugs in a designated space where
Drug consumption rooms have been criticised by the INCB in their recent annual reports , but are viewed by some EU Member States as a useful component of their responses to some forms of highly problematic drug use .
Consumption rooms are sometimes also viewed as an opportunity to limit public nuisance caused by the use of drugs .
Information , education and communication ( IEC ) techniques are used throughout Europe in initiatives that aim to reduce drug @-@ related deaths .
Several countries report that specifically developed information materials are distributed among drug users , their peers and families , or police .

One has only to consider the worrying developments resulting from the transiting of cocaine through West Africa to be reminded of the collateral damage that this problem can cause .
We are proud to present this , the thirteenth , annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
This report is only possible through the hard work and dedication of our partners in the Reitox network of national focal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis .
We also are indebted to those EU agencies and international organisations working in the drugs field .
Our report is a collective endeavour and we thank all those who have contributed to it .
The rationale behind this work is that a cool @-@ headed analysis of what we know about the drug situation is a condition for an informed , productive and reasoned debate .
It ensures that opinions are enlightened by facts , and that those making difficult policy choices can have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits of the options available .
On a positive note , drug use in Europe appears to be stabilising , and progress can be noted in the way in which EU Member States are addressing this issue .
For most forms of drug use , our overall assessment is that we are not seeing increases , and in some areas the trends appear to be downward .
In terms of responses , we have seen virtually all Member States adopt a strategic approach , and greater cohesion is visible at the European level .
Not many years ago , HIV infection among drug injectors was a central concern in the drugpolicy debate .
Since then , a pragmatic mixture of prevention , treatment and harmreduction measures has become the norm in Europe , and rates of new infection attributed to drug use have fallen and continue to do so .
It is gratifying to note that , by international standards , Europe stands out as one of the parts of the world where monitoring capacities are most developed .
Nonetheless , we are aware of the limitations of our current information resources , and are constantly working with our partners to improve the quality and relevance of the data available .
Good news makes poor headlines and can be overlooked .
However , it is important to recognise progress where it has been made .
Increasingly , in Europe , we have an understanding of what measures can be effective in addressing drug problems .
An acceptance that our activities can , and do , make a difference is a prerequisite to securing investment and policy support .
This is not to say that our report does not highlight many areas of concern for the European Union .
Examples include the continuing increases in cocaine use and the considerable differences that still exist between countries in the availability and quality of services for those with problems .
We must therefore conclude that , even if progress has been made , the journey remains far from finished .
However , today in Europe , more than at any time in the past , we have a stronger agreement on the direction we should take .
An underlying theme of the policy debate on drugs is the costs , both hidden and more visible , of Europe 's drug problem .
This issue is addressed in various parts of this report .
The EMCDDA has been working to develop an understanding of the public expenditures associated with tackling drug use in EU Member States .
This work is in its infancy , and estimates derived are indicative rather than precise .
Nonetheless , they point to considerable sums being spent , with preliminary figures of between EUR 28 billion and EUR 40 billion .
Less easy to express in economic terms is the harm caused by drug use .
The EMCDDA would like to thank the following for their help in producing this report :
• the heads of the Reitox national focal points and their staff ;
• the services within each Member State that collected the raw data for this report ;
• the members of the Management Board and the Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA ;

Reitox is the European information network on drugs and drug addiction .
The network is comprised of national focal points in the EU Member States , Norway , the candidate countries and at the European Commission .
Under the responsibility of their governments , the focal points are the national authorities providing drug information to the EMCDDA .
The contact details of the national focal points may be found at : http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / about / partners / reitox @-@ network
This annual report is based on information provided to the EMCDDA by the EU Member States and candidate countries and Norway ( participating in the work of the EMCDDA since 2001 ) in the form of a national report .
The statistical data reported here relate to the year 2006 ( or the last year available ) .
Graphics and tables in this report may reflect a subset of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
Retail prices of drugs reported to the EMCDDA reflect the price to the user .
For purity or potency and retail prices , all analyses are based on typical ( modal ) values or , in their absence , mean ( or median ) values .
Reports of the prevalence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged 15 @-@ 64 years .
In reports on treatment demand , " new clients " refers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " refers to all those entering treatment .
Clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
Where the proportion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denominator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .
Analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the time period in question .
Figures for 2005 may substitute for missing 2006 values in trend analysis of drug market data ; for the analysis of other trends , missing data may be interpolated .

Commentary The drug situation in Europe - new perspectives and some old realities
A strong voice from Europe in an important year for reflection and policy formation the user is often difficult , and Member States vary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
During the past five years , the number of reported drug law offences has increased in Europe .
In Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
At the same time , 13 Member States are redrafting or reviewing their national drug strategies or action plans .
This makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflections on how drug policies have performed to date , and what directions should be pursued in the future .
However , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly cannabis users , the likelihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
Furthermore , the extent to which sanctions applied for drug possession have changed is not clear , and the EMCDDA will explore this question in a selected issue next year .
New survey explores young people 's attitudes to drug use
A growing European consensus can be seen in the way Member States have adopted national drug strategies and in their contribution to the global debate on drugs .
EU Member States , supported by the Commission , have put forward an increasingly united EU position in the ongoing discussions that have accompanied the Ungass review .
Drug use and the application of criminal sanctions : a mixed picture
This distinction has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
A recent Eurobarometer survey explored young people 's attitudes and perceptions on drugs and found considerable consensus among countries .
Overall , the risks associated with using drugs such as heroin , cocaine and ecstasy were rated as high by between 81 % and 96 % of those surveyed .
The vast majority of respondents ( 95 % ) felt that these drugs should continue to be controlled in Europe .
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Drug use prevention : evidence base grows but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving reintegration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high prognostic value .
This situation is changing as the scientific basis for drug prevention continues to grow and more rigorous studies are carried out .
Together , the information now available allows for a greater understanding of what types of activities are likely to prove effective and how to target those most at risk .
Nevertheless , new data suggests that in many countries , the predominant approaches are often still those that lack a strong evidence base and , in some cases , include activities that may even be counterproductive .
The challenge for policymakers may be that those programmes that are known to deliver benefits often require both a greater investment of resources and more attention to training and quality control .
An important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care tailored to the needs of a more heterogeneous population of drug users .
It is therefore likely that European drug treatment services will have to develop an increasingly differentiated set of responses in the future if they are to match the increasingly differentiated needs of their clients .
The portal , which includes a prevention module , provides an overview of the latest evidence on programme efficacy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interventions .
Examples of evaluated practices across Europe are also provided .
Drug treatment : more emphasis on outcomes and client needs
Recent data from school and adult population surveys suggest that overall cannabis use has stabilised or is declining in some countries .
The number of drug users receiving treatment for their dependency has grown considerably in recent years , and many countries now have a significant proportion of their problem opioid users in long @-@ term substitution treatment .
This trend has led to a widening of the available pharmaceutical options and has resulted in an increased focus on treatment quality and outcome , as opposed to treatment uptake , as a primary policy concern .
Declines in prevalence are most apparent among younger age groups .
Commentary : the drug situation in Europe
At a glance - estimates of drug use in Europe
The estimates presented here relate to the adult population ( 15 @-@ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
For the complete set of data and information on the methodology see the accompanying statistical bulletin .
Lifetime prevalence : at least 71 million ( 22 % of European adults )
Last year use : about 23 million European adults or one @-@ third of lifetime users now visible , and is most evident in the 16 @-@ 24 age group .
Country variation in last year use : overall range 0.8 % to 11.2 %
Lifetime prevalence : at least 12 million ( 3.6 % of European adults )
Last year use : 4 million European adults or one @-@ third of lifetime users
Last month use : around 2 million
Lifetime prevalence : about 9.5 million ( 2.8 % of European adults )
Last year use : over 2.6 million or one @-@ third of lifetime users Last month use : more than 1 million
Country variation in last year use : overall range 0.2 % to 3.5 %
Lifetime prevalence : almost 11 million ( 3.3 % of European adults )
Last year use : around 2 million or one @-@ fifth of lifetime users Last month use : less than 1 million
In 2005 @-@ 06 , druginduced deaths accounted for 3.5 % of all deaths of Europeans 15 @-@ 39 years old , with opioids being found in around 70 % of them
Principal drug in around 50 % of all drug treatment requests
More than 600 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in 2006
The extent and relative market share of domestically produced herbal cannabis remains unknown , and in response to this the EMCDDA is carrying out a study on mapping the cannabis market in Europe .
There is also a growing debate about the implications of the evolving cannabis market .
Concerns being voiced include the negative impact of cannabis production sites on local communities through increased levels of criminality , and that domestically produced cannabis is typically of high potency .
Local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conceal and do not necessitate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe wastes resulting from synthetic drug production can be considerable .
Cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more recreational basis .
However , patterns of stimulant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most commonly used stimulant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Methamphetamine use remains rare outside the CzechRepublic and Slovakia , although the availability or use of the drug is sporadically reported by other countries .
As cocaine use continues to rise in Europe , increased efforts are being focused on cocaine interdiction .
Both the volume and number of cocaine seizures continue to increase , with annual seizures now in excess of 120 tonnes , of which more than three quarters are accounted for by Spain and Portugal .
This would imply that , as well as targeting individual substances , interventions need to consider stimulant drugs as a group rather than only as individual problems .
Although cocaine enters Europe by a number of routes , trafficking through west African countries has dramatically increased and now represents a major route for cocaine destined to the European market .
This situation has the potential to destabilise and undermine development efforts in a region already facing many social , health and political challenges .
In particular , the income generated by cocaine trafficking has considerable potential to undermine criminal justice systems and encourage corruption .
The European Union and its Member States are working together with west African countries to develop a range of measures to address this growing threat .
Developments in synthetic drug production in Europe increases concerns about environmental costs
Heroin problems not diminishing alongside reports of increased use of synthetic opioids
The most recent estimates show that , at an estimated 733 tonnes , potential global heroin production has continued to increase .
However , the impact of this increase on the availability and use of this drug in Europe is difficult to gauge .
The available data make drawing conclusions in this area difficult .
For example , the quantity of heroin seized in the European Union has declined slightly , but this has been counterbalanced by considerable increases in Turkey .
Typically , the production of one kilogram of amphetamine or MDMA results in around 15 @-@ 20 kilograms of waste material , including toxic and inflammable chemicals which constitute an environmental hazard .
Commentary : the drug situation in Europe the relative proportion of opioid users - but not their actual numbers - had been falling , but this trend now appears to have levelled out .
However , there remain important differences between countries .
Data from regional or local studies also suggest that transmission of HIV infection remains an issue in Spain and Italy , although the absence of national case reporting data makes tracking trends in these countries difficult .
Drugrelated deaths : a major burden on public health
Perhaps counter @-@ intuitively , given the situation in Afghanistan , problems with both diverted and illicitly produced synthetic opioids appear to be increasingly common in some countries .
In Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , for example , there are indications of a growing problem caused by the availability of 3 @-@ methylfentanyl that is illicitly manufactured outside the EU .
Drug injecting and HIV : overall picture positive but important national differences
The EMCDDA monitors fatal poisonings directly attributable to drug use ( drug @-@ induced deaths ) .
There are , on average , around 7 000 @-@ 8 000 druginduced deaths reported in Europe each year , and due to known underreporting this figure represents a minimum estimate .
Opioids , principally heroin , are the drugs most often associated with overdose , although other drugs and alcohol are commonly present .
After falling for some years in the early part of this decade , the trend in druginduced deaths has now levelled out .
The reasons for this are unclear , indicating a need for more research on both the factors associated with overdose and on the effectiveness of prevention measures .
Drug users leaving prison may be at particular risk , with a recent study reporting mortality rates eight to ten times higher than expected .
Overall , overdose prevention remains an area requiring increased investment .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fifty times higher than that found among the general population .
In some countries , particularly in eastern Europe , drug injection remains the principal route of heroin administration and is reported by over 80 % of heroin users entering treatment .
Relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
Reports suggest that the number of online retailers of these products is growing and that they adapt rapidly to attempts to control the market , for example through the launch of new products .
In addition , online pharmacies and online retailers selling psychoactive substances for ostensibly legitimate purposes also potentially provide new avenues for illicit drug supply .
Taken together , Internet sales now represent a considerable challenge to both international and national drug policies and control mechanisms .
Given the speed at which new products can appear and be distributed , the monitoring of online activities is becoming an important area for development .
Growing recognition of the importance of dialogue with civil society
Drug problems are intertwined with a range of other social and health issues .
Consequently , successful interventions in this area require the involvement of a broad alliance of participants and can benefit from the support of the communities in which they are implemented .
Less positively , this progress has not been accompanied by a comparable increase in the cooperation and coordination of drugrelated research efforts among EU Member States .
Chapter 1 Policies and laws
Introduction themselves to achieving measurable results in reducing the supply and demand for illicit drugs by 2008 .
Drugpolicy is set to be an important issue in 2008 .
In this year , both the United Nations and the European Union assess the results of their drug policies on the use of , and harms caused by , illicit drugs .
In Europe , 2008 sees the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) and the drafting of the action plan for 2009 @-@ 12 .
Furthermore , an unprecedented number of EU Member States also review their national drug strategies and action plans and draft new drugpolicy documents ( 1 ) during this year .
This assessment is to be followed by a one @-@ year reflection period , during which discussions will first be held among intergovernmental expert working groups and then in intersessional meetings .
The EMCDDA will discuss the findings and developments made during 2008 in its next annual report .
The chapter ends with an overview of drugrelated research in EU Member States .
The European Union is playing an active role in the Ungass review .
Ungass 10 @-@ year review
Evaluation of the EU action plan on drugs
In June 1998 , the 20th UN General Assembly Special Session ( Ungass ) convened in New York to debate the world drug problem .
This " drug summit " set a new agenda for the international community through the adoption of three key documents ( 2
In December 2007 , the European Commission presented its second progress review on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) .
It also highlighted difficulties in collecting data
Chapter 1 : Policies and laws
New developments on supply @-@ reduction activities and in linking some of the planned actions with the indicator chosen to assess their implementation .
The final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with input from the EU Member States , Europol and the EMCDDA .
New drug action plans or programmes were adopted by four EU Member States ( Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Finland ) , Turkey and Norway in the second half of 2007 .
All of these documents cover a time span of three to four years and , with the exception of the Turkish action plan , they have been preceded by previous plans or programmes .
In the same year , Spain also adopted a complementary national action programme against cocaine ( 2007 @-@ 10 ) .
Other EU developments
In early 2008 , three more Member States adopted new policy documents .
Italy 's first drug action plan has a time frame of one year , and is to be followed by a four @-@ year action plan ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) , which will be synchronised with the new EU action plan on drugs .
Malta 's first ever national drugpolicy document , while not defining the time frame , includes almost 50 actions to be implemented in the coming years .
Under the programme , EUR 21.35 million will be available for Commission studies , operational costs of European non @-@ governmental organisations in the drugs field , and transnational projects .
Norway continues to be one of the exceptions to this pattern , with illicit drugs and alcohol fully integrated in its recently adopted action plan .
In June 2006 , the European Commission issued a Green Paper on the role of civil society in drug policy , as called for in the current drug action plan .
This was followed in 2007 by the selection process for a new civil society forum on drugs .
The forum includes 26 organisations representing a wide spectrum of views .
It met for the first time in December 2007 and again in May 2008 to discuss the evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs and the new action plan .
See the 2006 selected issue European drug policies : extended beyond illicit drugs ?
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Some examples of this diversity are highlighted in Chapter 2 .
In 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
Following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will renew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will renew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will renew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
No national drugpolicy document
Single national drugpolicy document
Two complementary national drugpolicy documents
Reitox national focal points .
EU Member States differ , however , in their methods and approaches for evaluating national drug strategies and action plans ; and there is a need to identify best practices in this field .
This was highlighted at a conference on evaluation organised by the Portuguese Presidency of the EU in September 2007 .
To respond to this challenge , the EMCDDA , in collaboration with Member States , is exploring the possibility of developing European guidelines in this field .
Drugrelated public expenditure
In 2000 , when the European Union used this approach for the first time , only two Member States had two complementary drugpolicy documents .
However , as European countries differ in their drug problem as well
Chapter 1 : Policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
Eleven Member States gave details of expenditure by the State on certain activities undertaken in response to the drug problem .
A further two countries provided rough estimates of overall public expenditure related to the drug problem ( Spain , Malta ) , though with no information on the activities on which the money was spent .
In addition , it was estimated that drug users spent EUR 3 980 million for the purchase of illicit drugs .
On the basis of these data , the cost of drug use in Italy is estimated to represent 0.7 % of the national gross domestic product .
In 2005 , the total drugrelated public expenditure by European countries was calculated to lie somewhere between EUR 13 billion and EUR 36 billion ( EMCDDA , 2007a ) .
This figure was estimated by extrapolating the total drugrelated expenditures of six countries ( Belgium , Hungary , Netherlands , Finland , Sweden , UnitedKingdom ) to the other States .
A revised estimate , which includes data from additional countries ( Czech Republic , France , Luxembourg , Poland , Slovakia ) , has recently been proposed ( EMCDDA , 2008d ) .
This suggests that State expenditure on the drug problem costs the average EU citizen EUR 60 a year .
These figures must , however , still be taken as indicative because of the limited data on which they are based .
Reports on the social cost of drug use
Data on the social cost of drug use ( direct and indirect costs caused by drug use ) were reported by four Member States .
Observing the changes in three key areas , this section
Table 1 : Drug @-@ labelled public expenditure ( 1

Public expenditures explicitly " labelled " as drugrelated in official accountancy documents .

These expenditures are not necessarily labelled as drugrelated in official accountancy documents .
Class A drugs are defined as those considered to be the most harmful .
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking offence .
In response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 , the EMCDDA has developed a project aimed at identifying , developing and testing methods for quantifying drugrelated public expenditures .
A selected issue on this topic gives an overview on the overall figures on drugrelated public expenditure in 2005 in the EU Member States and Norway .
Most of the expenditures identified were originally " labelled " as drug related , and were generally traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents , thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs .
When feasible , hidden or " unlabelled " expenditures embedded in programmes with broader goals were estimated through modelling techniques .
This new twofold approach provides standardised estimates that maximise the validity and cross @-@ country comparability of public disbursements in tackling drugs and drug addiction .
This selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / publications / selectedissues ) .
asks the question : Do the changes in legal definitions and responses to drug users indicate a new , wider trend in how countries view users of drugs ?
Possession for personal use
However , during this period , not all countries have been reducing penalties : France and Poland decided not to change their laws after consultations ; and Denmark raised the " normal " penalties from cautions to fines ( which were then increased ) .
In the United Kingdom , it has been announced that cannabis is to be reclassified upwards .
However , Member States differ considerably in how they have chosen to define these categories in the new laws that they have adopted in recent years .
The changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . First , they all widen the scope for directing drug users in to treatment .
In the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
In 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
In Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . Special drug courts have been established
Chapter 1 : Policies and laws controlled by new laws : trains and ships in Ireland ; boats in Latvia ; aviation in Finland .
The Netherlands aims to increase the use of treatment as a condition of early release from prison .
When deemed appropriate , in Finland , sentenced offenders can now be directed towards an open prison if they stay drugfree ; in Greece , they may be sent to a special treatment unit .
In Belgium , at all levels of the criminal justice process , alternatives exist to divert drug @-@ using offenders in to treatment .
Further descriptions of the various treatment alternatives to punishment and the extent of their use can be found in the

Focus on protecting the public
Though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
The measures that reduce criminal penalties for personal use or offer alternatives to punishment , described above , are part of this development .
Use- and supply @-@ related offences
Most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

National drugrelated research specifically designated for drugrelated research can be available through national drug coordination bodies ( Czech Republic , Spain , France , Luxembourg , Hungary , Poland , Portugal , Norway ) .
Both types of funding programmes often couple research on illicit drugs with other areas within the addiction field , such as alcohol , tobacco and gambling .
The funds are mostly available through contracts for commissioned research or through framework programmes to which researchers apply .
Other types of funding sources reported include foundations , scientific academies , private institutions , special funds for the fight against drugs , the European Commission and the United Nations .
Structures and projects
Based on reports from 25 Member States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an overview of the organisation of drugrelated research in European countries .
Coordinating and funding
National research networks were reported by some countries ( Germany , Spain , Portugal ) .
These can play an important role in the organisation and funding of research , and may also promote more direct links between research and practice .
In 15 of the 27 reporting countries , structures to coordinate drugrelated research exist at national level .
Also cited were studies in determinants , risk and protective factors for drug use , consequences of drug use , and drug mechanisms and affects .
Constraints to drugrelated research were reported by several countries .
Among the problems identified were : organisational aspects , such as a lack of coordination and scattered resources ( Germany , France , Austria ) ; the
Detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the EMCDDA through its network of Reitox national focal points .

Dissemination abstracts and welcome international contributions .
In addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction , articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer @-@ reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines .
In 2006 , research findings in the drugs field were published in more than 100 such European journals .
Other types of publication , including those by national focal points , also play an important role in dissemination .
A total of 25 European peer @-@ reviewed journals specialising in the drugs field and publishing in 11 languages other than English were identified .
The majority of these national journals publish English
Chapter 2 Responding to drug problems in Europe - an overview
Introduction
Improving the monitoring of drug supply reduction
This chapter presents an overview of the responses to drug problems in Europe , where possible highlighting trends , developments and quality issues .
The set of measures reviewed here includes prevention , treatment , harmreduction and social reintegration , which taken together form a comprehensive demand @-@ reduction system .
The chapter also includes a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
In addition , future monitoring challenges in another field of drug policy , drug supply reduction , are briefly discussed .
Drug supply reduction can be defined as encompassing all activities aimed at preventing illicit drugs from reaching users .
Law enforcement activities , alternative development initiatives and projects aimed at preventing drugrelated crime all contribute to reducing the supply of illicit drugs .
Monitoring and analysis constitute , as is the case with drug demand reduction , an important support for these activities and their evaluation .
Drug prevention can be divided in to different levels or strategies , from environmental to indicated prevention , which ideally do not compete but complement each other .
Activities related to international projects are usually well documented , while data on activities at national level are often difficult to access and compare .
The European Commission , Eurostat , Europol and the EMCDDA are working to improve this situation in the framework of the next EU action plan on drugs ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
Existing conceptual frameworks and information systems , as well as potential information sources for monitoring and analysing supply reduction activities in the Member States , are to be reviewed .
There is also a need to better understand drug markets , in particular supply and distribution arrangements , both in their economic and social dimensions .
Two studies funded by the European Commission will explore both the information systems and sources on drug supply reduction and the international drug markets .
The objectives of universal school @-@ based drug prevention in Europe appear to have shifted in recent years .
The changes in reported objectives may reflect the adoption of a more rational and evidencebased approach , but the extent to which this change in objectives reflects actual provision is unclear .
The effectiveness of these interventions is unclear .
In contrast , some of the more strongly evidencebased interventions are reported in only a few countries .
These include standardised programmes , peer approaches or interventions specifically for boys ; all of which aim

Full provision : the intervention is available in almost all locations where the size of the target population is sufficient for its implementation .
In addition , the following categories of interventions were each reported by four countries : addressing social disadvantage ( e.g. unemployment ) , helping with criminal justice problems , or assisting marginalised families from ethnic minorities .
Furthermore , only three countries address the needs of families coping with mental health problems .
Risk conditions of young vulnerable groups , for example , young offenders , homeless , truant , disadvantaged and minority youth , are also rarely addressed despite increasing political importance .
Since 2004 , an increasing number of drug policies have indicated them as primary targets for prevention interventions , but the reported level of intervention provision has not increased during this period .
More detailed data a represented in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups of young people .
Indicated prevention
This selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( http : / / emcdda.europa.eu / publications / selected @-@ issues ) .
Efficacy and risks of interventions
Such individuals include school dropouts , and those with psychiatric disorders , antisocial behaviour or early signs of drug use .
Drug use among children and in families remains the main focus of targeted prevention in Europe .
Several research studies have shown that interventions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environments and reduce social exclusion , also have a moderating effect on later substance use ( Toumbourou et al . , 2007 ) .
The overall effectiveness of school @-@ based prevention has been questioned ( Coggans , 2006 ; Gorman et al . , 2007 ) .
Recent literature reviews ( 19 ) , however , show that certain
Children with behavioural disorders , such as coexisting attention deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder and conduct disorder , are at high risk of developing substance use problems .
Intervening early with children with behavioural disorders requires close cooperation between medical , social and youth services .
The EMCDDA " Best practice " portal content of prevention projects .
In the Czech Republic , for instance , certification of preventive activities is a condition for receiving subsidies from the State budget .
This section aims to provide an overview of drug treatment in Europe , describing the organisation and provision of services .
The first module of the portal focuses on universal prevention , in particular on evidence of efficacy which is based on several reviews published since 2000 .
For details of the findings , see the portal ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / themes / best @-@ practice ) .
The portal provides information on the efficacy of various interventions , but it should be noted that the evidence base remains sometimes limited and that making choices between different interventions requires caution .
Furthermore , as controlled trials measure the efficacy of programmes , how certain interventions will perform in different settings remains subject to question .
The new edition of the EDDRA databank , available on the portal , features examples of evaluated interventions in different countries and settings , and may provide additional guidance .
General practitioners also play an important role , and in some countries are key providers of substitution treatment .
The private sector can also be involved in some countries , mainly in residential care .
Nevertheless , funding for drug treatment is mostly provided by the public purse or is linked to social or health insurances .
The " Unplugged " programme used in the trial challenged norms about the acceptance and beliefs about the prevalence of substance use among youth .
This is particularly important for universal school @-@ based prevention , which is delivered to a large and diverse target population .
For instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only ineffective but may carry risks of unwanted effects ( Werch and Owen , 2002 ) .
The same applies to mass @-@ media campaigns , which can carry risks of increasing the propensity for substance use ( 21 ) .
Outpatient settings , including general practice , account for most of the treatment for drug use in Europe , mainly because substitution treatment is usually delivered in these settings .
Around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .
One way to ensure that prevention programmes are evidencebased and that risks of unwanted effects are reduced is to develop standards for the delivery and
Half of the clients entering treatment in outpatient settings reported primary opioid use , while 21 % cited cannabis and 16 % cocaine as their primary drug . Increases in the

However , the overall availability of services specifically targeted to the needs of non @-@ opioid drug users remains limited .
Treatment in inpatient settings takes place mostly in therapeutic communities , psychiatric hospitals and specialised departments in general hospitals .
The services provided range from short @-@ term detoxification to prolonged psychiatric and abstinence @-@ based treatment programmes .
The proportion
In Hungary , where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing , a study among the out @-@ of @-@ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
Due to the specific profile of the Baltic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
Financial support for harmreduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among injecting drug users and in prison settings . "
Historically , drug @-@ treatment services have been organised around the needs of opioid users , who still represent the main group of users in treatment .
In Turkey , substitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres .
After methadone , buprenorphine is the second most commonly prescribed opioid substitute , and its use in the treatment of opioid dependence has increased in recent years ( see Chapter 6 ) .
Finally , some Member States have recently looked at the consequences of the introduction of harmreduction interventions .
The prevention and reduction of drugrelated harm is a public health objective in all Member States and in the EU drug strategy and action plan ( European Commission , 2007a ) .
Such disadvantage tends also to be more widespread among specific groups

of users , particularly women , heroin and crack users , those who belong to ethnic minorities and those with co @-@ morbid psychiatric problems .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of inmates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of inmates have injected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
Helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social reintegration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
Health and social responses in prison
Prisons represent an important setting for the delivery of health and social interventions to drug users .
The prison population in the European Union is over 607 000 ( 33 ) , with an estimated annual turnover of more than 860 000 prisoners .
From the data available , it can be estimated that more than 400 000 people with past or current experience of illicit drug use pass through EU prisons every year .
See Table TDI @-@ 15 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
See Table TDI @-@ 20 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
The term " prisoners " is used in a broad sense here , and includes both on @-@ remand and convicted incarcerated persons .
In addition , these interventions have become more widely available within countries .
Prison @-@ based substitution treatment is officially available in all countries except Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Cyprus , Slovakia and Turkey , though , in many countries , the overall accessibility of this treatment option is limited .
Spain is currently the only European country that provides a wide range of harmreduction measures in prisons .
The responsibility for healthcare in prison lies , in most countries , with the Ministry of Justice .
However , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
Compared to five years ago , more countries now report activities in the following
In 2006 , only four Member States reported sociodemographic data and information on drug use patterns of prisoners in drug treatment through their national treatment monitoring systems .
Recent legislation on drug treatment in prison
In 2006 and early 2007 , six countries revised their legal frameworks and guidelines affecting prisoners " rights to drug treatment .
In Belgium , a 2006 directive from the Ministry for Justice states that inmates have the right to the same range of treatment options as are available outside prison .
In Denmark , a change in the law from January 2007 entitles imprisoned drug users to free treatment for their drug use .
The law stipulates that the treatment should normally start within 14 days of the prisoner requesting it from the Danish Prison and Probation Service .
However , there is no such entitlement if the offender is expected to be released within three months or is considered unfit or not motivated for treatment .
More specifically , in Slovakia , a 2006 law permitted the provision of psychological services to drug users on remand who are suffering from withdrawal symptoms .
The aim of this law is to provide drug users with such services at the time when they are most needed , at the time of enforced withdrawal immediately upon entering custody .
It also created a legislative framework to support the existing special treatment units for convicted drug users .
Drug supply and availability - data and sources
Systematic and routine information to describe illicit drug markets and trafficking is still limited .
Production estimates of heroin , cocaine and cannabis are obtained from cultivation estimates based on fieldwork ( sampling on the ground ) and aerial or satellite surveys .
These estimates have some important limitations linked , for instance , with variations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops which are not grown in restricted geographical areas , like cannabis .
Data on purity or potency and retail prices of illicit drugs may also be analysed in order to understand retail drug markets .
However , the availability of this type of data may be limited and there may be questions of reliability and comparability .
Intelligence information from law enforcement agencies may help complete the picture .
In the early and mid @-@ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high prevalence , whereas the European norm was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
Moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @-@ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis @-@ related problems .
Europe may now be moving in to a new phase , as data are pointing to a stabilising or even decreasing situation .
Levels of use remain high by historical standards , however ; what constitutes an effective response to cannabis use remains a key question in the European debate on drugs .
The EMCDDA collects national data on drug seizures , purity and retail prices in Europe .
Other data on drug supply comes largely from UNODC 's information systems and analyses , complemented by additional information from Europol .
Information on drug precursors is obtained from the INCB , which is involved in international initiatives to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs .
( Reitox national reports ) . Herbal cannabis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : west and southern Africa ( Nigeria , Angola ) , south @-@ east Asia ( Thailand ) , south @-@ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americas ( Colombia , Jamaica ) ( CND , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
Cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
These facts taken together mean that producing estimates of the worldwide production of cannabis with any precision is likely to be very difficult .
The widespread cultivation of cannabis also means that a significant proportion of trafficking is likely to be intraregional .
This is the case for some herbal cannabis in
Europe , where in addition to home production ( 35
The area under cannabis resin production declined from 134 000 hectares in 2003 to and the Netherlands have been noted as source countries
For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability , see the box on this page .
Cannabis production in Europe
76 400 hectares producing 1 066 tonnes in 2005 ( UNODC and Government of Morocco , 2007 ) .
Resin production is also reported in Afghanistan , where it is rising rapidly , Pakistan , India , Nepal , and Central Asian and other CIS countries ( UNODC , 2008 ) .
Cannabis resin produced in Morocco is typically smuggled in to Europe via the Iberian peninsula ( Europol , 2008 ) , with some of it being further distributed from the Netherlands .
In 2006 , 52 30 tonnes of herbal cannabis and 10 25 tonnes of cannabis resin were seized worldwide , down from peak levels in 2004 .
North America continued to account for the bulk of herbal cannabis seized ( 58 % ) , while quantities of resin seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 62 % ) ( UNODC , 2008 ) .
Available information is patchy and does not allow an accurate assessment of the extent of cannabis cultivation in Europe .
Nevertheless , reports from a numberofcountries suggest that it may no longer be viewed as marginal .
For example , French population surveys in 2005 estimated that about 200 000 people had grown cannabis at least once in their lifetime .
In the Netherlands , cannabis cultivation is widespread in some parts of the country , with an estimated total of 6 000 cultivation sites dismantled in 2005 and 2006 .
In Europe , an estimated 177 000 seizures of herbal cannabis , amounting to 86 tonnes , were made in 2006 ( 36 ) .
The UnitedKingdom is the EU Member State reporting the most seizures of herbal cannabis , though data are not yet available for 2006 .
Turkey reported seizures of record amounts of herbal cannabis in 2006 .
The number of herbal cannabis seizures in Europe has increased steadily since 2001 , while there has been an overall decrease in the quantity seized , until 2005 , with an increase noted in the most recent data .
In some countries , it seems that a majority of users are now consuming locally produced herbal cannabis .
Cannabis that is produced locally also has the advantage for the producer that it does not need to be transported across national borders .
Seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal seizures both in terms of number and quantity : with twice as many seizures ( 325 000 ) and the amount intercepted ( 713 tonnes ) eight times higher .
After a period of stabilisation in 2001 @-@ 03 , the number of cannabis resin seizures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities intercepted increased until 2003 @-@ 04 , but thereafter have been declining .
in the recovery of about 2.3 million cannabis plants ( and 22 tonnes of cannabis plants ( 64 % accounted by Spain ) .
Following a steady increase since 2001 ,
The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 , SZR @-@ 4 , SZR @-@ 5 and SZR @-@ 6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Population surveys : an important tool for understanding patterns and trends of drug use in Europe
Surveys also provide useful contextual information on patterns of use , sociodemographic characteristics of users and perceptions of risks and availability ( 1 ) .
In 2006 , the reported THC content of resin samples ranged from 2.3 % to 18.4 % , while that of herbal cannabis ranged from under 1 % to 13 % .
However , there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
It is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once ( lifetime prevalence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15- to 64 @-@ year- olds ( see Table 2 for a summary of the data ) .
The EMCDDA standard age ranges are : all adults ( 15 @-@ 64 years ) and young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) .
generally being reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Many countries report comparatively high prevalence levels of last year and last month use of cannabis .
Estimates of last month prevalence will include those using the drug more regularly , though not necessarily in an intensive way ( see below ) .
Population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) have ever used cannabis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
It is estimated that even higher proportions of Europeans in the 15 @-@ 24 age
See Tables PPP @-@ 1 and PPP @-@ 5 in the 2008 statistical bulletin for potency and price data .
group have used cannabis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
Cannabis use is higher among males than among females ( see the 2006 selected issue on gender ) , although marked differences between countries are observed .
For example , the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4 males for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy .
As with lifetime experience , there is a wide variation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
In some countries it is virtually unreported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among males .
After tobacco and alcohol , cannabis also continues to be the psychoactive substance most commonly used by school students .
Ever in lifetime use of cannabis by 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experimenting with this substance often occurs at or around this age .
Data from the 2005 / 06 HBSC survey of 15 @-@ year @-@ olds showed large variation in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use across 27 countries .
European figures can be compared with those from other parts of the world .
Patterns of cannabis use
The fourth round of the " European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs " ( ESPAD ) was conducted in 2007 with the participation of 25 EU Member States , Croatia and Norway .
This survey specifically investigates substance use among school students who turn 16 during the calendar year .
Results from the latest surveys will be published in December 2008 .
Participation in both of these international school surveys , each conducted every four years , has grown in each round and now includes most European countries .
Spain , Italy , Portugal , Slovakia , Sweden and the UnitedKingdom also reported data on cannabis use from their own national school surveys in 2006 .
Estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . Daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .

Information based on the last survey available for each country .
The study year ranges from 2001 to 2007 .
The average prevalence for Europe was computed by a weighted average according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
In countries for which no information was available , the average EU prevalence was imputed .

Patterns of cannabis use among school students
HBSC data show that frequent cannabis use remains rare among 15 @-@ year @-@ old schoolchildren .
This issue is highlighted in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups .
The comparison shows that , on average , students who have used cannabis are more likely to have used other substances .
Although among cannabis users the last month prevalence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and binge drinking among cannabis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
Nevertheless , due to the relatively larger proportion of the population using cannabis regularly , the overall impact of intensive forms of cannabis use on public health may be significant .
In an Australian study , 92 % of long @-@ term cannabis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them judged to be dependent at the time of the study .
A follow @-@ up study carried out one year later suggested that , among long @-@ term users , measures of cannabis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time ( Swift et al . , 2000 ) .
Only Sweden and Norway report a series of surveys of young people or conscripts dating back to the 1970s .
A first wave of use was observed in the 1970s , followed by a decline in the 1980s and a new substantial increase during the 1990s .
The EMCDDA is developing , in collaboration with several countries , methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long @-@ term forms of cannabis use , including dependence .
This information may assist EU Member

Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe school students .
A comparison of HBSC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreasing trend in both lifetime and other more frequent cannabis use among 15 @-@ year @-@ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
Other recent national school surveys conducted in Spain , Portugal , Slovakia , Sweden and the UnitedKingdom also report stable or decreasing trends .
markedly during the 1990s , in particular among young people ( Figure 4 ) and school students .
As cannabis availability in Europe as a whole does not seem to have changed and prices seem to be decreasing in most countries providing information , an explanation for the current stabilisation or decrease has to be found elsewhere .
The 2005 French population survey Baromètre sante noted that among those who had stopped using cannabis , 80 % cited a lack of interest as the reason for quitting .

Decreases in experimental or occasional use of cannabis are not necessarily directly related to trends in the regular use of the drug .
Among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
in France , Hungary and the Netherlands (
Client profiles in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . Those variations may be explained by differences in prevalence of intensive cannabis use , drug treatment organisation or referral practices .
See Figure TDI @-@ 2 ( part ii ) in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
See Table TDI @-@ 5 ( part ii ) in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Overall , primary cannabis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequency of use : those who use it occasionally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
However , considerable differences are observed between countries , particularly in the proportion of regular cannabis users entering treatment .
In Denmark , special funds have recently been allocated for the development of targeted programmes for young cannabis users .
In addition , Belgium , Germany , France , the Netherlands and Switzerland are collaborating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family @-@ based treatment for problematic cannabis use ( Incant ) ( 58 ) .
This finding suggests that many cannabis users are treated within the same settings as the users of other drugs , which may present difficulties , both to treatment staff and to clients .
These Internetbased services are targeted at young people and focus on problems related to alcohol and cannabis .
Of the specialist services surveyed , most offered short courses of treatment for cannabis use of usually less than 20 sessions .
Treatment generally took the form of individual counselling and therapy or counselling about the possible implications of cannabis use .
Some agencies reported cannabis detoxification , family therapy , therapeutic community and mutual help groups as possible components of treatment .
Use of residential care for cannabis treatment when provided was generally in the context of socio @-@ behavioural problems respite .
Although most studies on the efficacy of cannabis treatment have been carried out in the United States and Australia , European studies are now beginning to be launched or reported .
Chapter 3 : Cannabis further development of drug use and re @-@ offending , and may include family , school or psychological counselling .
Germany , Spain ( Catalonia ) , Luxembourg and Austria have implemented protocols and programmes for young people breaking drug laws or who have been convicted for the use or possession of drugs , mostly cannabis .
The offender may be given the choice of completing a course , instead of paying a fine .
The programmes offered in the various countries aim to prevent
An evaluation of the similar youth offending teams ( YOT ) in the UnitedKingdom found that this approach had considerable potential benefits ( Matrix Research , 2007 ) .
Smoking bans and cannabis regulatory tobacco policies could favourably influence perceived norms , which are predictors for both tobacco and cannabis use .
The possible links between tobacco policies and cannabis smoking is an issue meriting attention .
There is also some evidence that cannabis is an economic complement ( i.e. responding in the same direction to price and availability ) to cigarettes ( Cameron and Williams , 2001 ) .
Isolated studies found that higher cigarette taxes appear to decrease the intensity of marijuana use and may have a modest negative effect on the probability of use among males ( Farrelly et al . , 2001 ) .
However , in Europe , cannabis use is more prevalent among tobacco smokers than among non @-@ smokers and strong
Finally , it is worth noting that the Dutch ban on smoking tobacco in restaurants and bars applies also to coffee shops , and that the city of Amsterdam has decided to ban cannabis smoking in public .
Chapter 4 Amphetamines , ecstasy and LSD
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants .
Of the two drugs , amphetamine is by far the more commonly available in Europe , whereas significant methamphetamine use appears to be restricted to the CzechRepublic and Slovakia .
Globally , after cannabis , amphetamines ( a generic term that includes both amphetamine and methamphetamine ) and ecstasy are among the most commonly consumed illicit drugs .
Moreover , in parts of Europe , use of amphetamines constitutes an important part of the drug problem , accounting for a substantial proportion of those in need of treatment .
Ecstasy refers to synthetic substances that are chemically related to amphetamines , but which differ to some extent in their effects .
The best @-@ known member of the ecstasy group of drugs is 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) , but other analogues are also sometimes found in ecstasy tablets ( MDA , MDEA ) .
Ecstasy use was virtually unknown in Europe before the late 1980s , but increased dramatically during the 1990s .
Its popularity has historically been linked with the dance @-@ music scene and , in general , synthetic drug use at high prevalence is associated with particular cultural sub @-@ groups or social settings .
However , there appears to be a growing interest among young people in naturally occurring hallucinogenic substances .
On the illicit drugs market , the main representatives of the amphetamines group are amphetamine and methamphetamine ( and their salts ) - two closely related synthetic substances , members of the phenethylamine family .
Both substances are central nervous system stimulants , sharing the same mechanism of action , and having similar behavioural effects , tolerance , withdrawal and prolonged ( chronic ) use effects .
Amphetamine is less potent than methamphetamine , but in uncontrolled situations the effects are almost indistinguishable .
Amphetamine and methamphetamine products mostly consist of powders , but " ice , " the pure crystalline hydrochloride salt of methamphetamine is also used .
Tablets containing either amphetamine or methamphetamine may carry logos similar to those seen on MDMA and other ecstasy tablets .
Given the physical forms in which they are available , amphetamine and methamphetamine may be ingested , snorted , inhaled and , less commonly , injected .
Unlike the sulphate salt of amphetamine , methamphetamine hydrochloride , particularly the crystalline form ( " ice " ) , is sufficiently volatile to be smoked .
For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability , see p.36.
Methamphetamine major producer and consumer of this drug ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2008 ) .
Most amphetamine seized in Europe is produced , in order of importance , in the Netherlands , Poland and Belgium , and to a lesser extent in Estonia and Lithuania .
International action against the manufacture and diversion of synthetic drug precursors
Turkey reported seizures of about 20 million amphetamine tablets with the logo " Captagon . "
Production of amphetamine in this form is reported in both Bulgaria and Turkey , and is thought to be largely intended for exportation to consumer countries in the Near and Middle East .
Project Prism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs , through a system of preexport notifications for licit trade and the reporting of shipments stopped and seizures made when suspicious transactions occur .
In Europe , an estimated 38 000 seizures amounting to 6.2 tonnes of amphetamine powder were made in 2006 .
However , this conclusion is provisional as the most recent data from the United Kingdom , the country in Europe which typically reports the most seizures , are not yet available .
Globally , reports suggest that over 11 tonnes of ephedrine and pseudo @-@ ephedrine , key precursors of methamphetamine , were seized in 2006 .
The purity of amphetamine samples intercepted in Europe in 2006 varied considerably and to such an extent that any comment on typical values must be made with caution .
Nevertheless , countries reporting data for 2006 can be divided in to two groups , with 10 countries reporting values of between 2 % and 10 % and the others reporting higher purity levels ( 25 @-@ 47 % ) .
This latter group typically included those countries known for having greater involvement with the production , trafficking or consumption of amphetamine ( Netherlands , Poland , Baltic and Nordic countries ) .
Over the past five years , the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 19 countries where sufficient data are available to allow an analysis .
Seizures of safrole , which may replace 3,4 @-@ MDP @-@ 2 @-@ P in the synthesis of MDMA , remained marginal in 2006 , with 62 litres seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seizure of safrole ( 7 litres ) .
In 2006 , the typical retail price of amphetamine varied between EUR 10 and EUR 15 a gram in half of the reporting countries .
Over the period 2001 @-@ 06 , with the exception of the Czech Republic , Spain and Romania , the retail price of amphetamine was reported to have fallen in all 16 countries reporting sufficient data for analysis .
The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 11 to SZR @-@ 18 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Note that where data for 2006 are absent , the corresponding data for 2005 are used to estimate European totals .
In Latvia and Malta , most tablets analysed did not contain any controlled substance .
Illicit production of methamphetamine does occur in Europe , though it is largely limited to the Czech Republic , where over 400 small @-@ scale " kitchen laboratories " were detected in 2006 .
The drug is also reported to be produced in Slovakia and , to a lesser extent , Lithuania ( INCB , 2008a ) .
About 3 000 seizures of methamphetamine amounting to 154 kg of the drug were reported in 17 European countries in 2006 .
Norway accounts for most seizures and amounts recovered , followed by Sweden , the CzechRepublic and Slovakia .
In the latter two countries , seizures tended to be small , usually of a few grams or less .
Between 2001 and 2006 , both the number and the quantity of methamphetamine seized in Europe have been increasing ; though still remaining low in comparison to other drugs .
In 2006 , the limited data available suggest that the typical purity of methamphetamine fell somewhere between 20 % and 55 % .
Most countries reported that the typical MDMA content of ecstasy tablets was somewhere between 25 and 65 mg - although there was considerable variation in the samples analysed ( 9 @-@ 90 mg ) .
No clear medium @-@ term trend is observable in the MDMA content of ecstasy tablets .
It is clear , however , that in comparison to when the drug first became widely available in Europe in the early 1990s , ecstasy has become considerably cheaper .
Global ecstasy production is reported by the UNODC ( 2007a ) to have fallen to around 102 tonnes in 2006 .
Production appears to have become more geographically diffuse , with manufacture for local consumption now more common in North America and east and south @-@ east Asia .
LSD use and trafficking is still considered marginal , although seizures in Europe are possibly suggestive of a revival in interest in the drug in the last few years .
After a long @-@ term downward trend dating back to the 1990s , both the number and the quantity of seizures have been increasing since 2003 .
LSD retail prices ( adjusted for inflation ) have been slightly declining since 2001 , and ranged in 2006 between EUR 5 and EUR 11 per unit in most European countries .
Prevalence and patterns of use
The relative importance of Europe as both a consumer and producer of ecstasy can be seen from the data on drug seizures .
Europe reported over 20 000 seizures resulting in the interception of nearly 14 million ecstasy tablets in 2006 .
The Netherlands accounted for the largest quantity of ecstasy seized ( 4.1 million tablets ) , followed by the United Kingdom , Turkey , France and Germany .
Overall , the number of ecstasy seizures has decreased over the period 2001 @-@ 06 , and the quantity seized has also declined , after a peak year in 2002 ( 64 ) .
In contrast , overall , consumption levels of synthetic hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) are lower and have been largely stable for a considerable period .
Higher prevalence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of , in simple terms at least , two distinct consumption patterns . In a limited number of
This picture is preliminary as data for the United Kingdom , the country reporting the most seizures in 2005 , are not yet available for 2006 .
The European stimulant market : " cocaine countries " and " amphetamines countries " ?
In some countries , cocaine appears to be the dominant stimulant drug , while in others , amphetamine or methamphetamine appear more commonly used . The picture that emerges from combining
Stimulant markets in Europe : the relative prevalence of cocaine or amphetamines in seizures and population surveys , and the proportion of drug users in treatment reporting these substances as primary drugs
countries , the use , often by injection , of amphetamine or methamphetamine accounts for a substantial proportion of the overall number of problem drug users and those seeking help for drug problems .
Data from treatment clients also suggests that those being treated for problems caused by stimulant drugs tend to be experiencing problems with only one class of stimulants .
Moreover , reports from some countries suggest that one stimulant can sometimes displace another on the drugs market .
On average , 3.3 % of all European adults report having used amphetamines at least once .
Use of the drug in the last year is much lower , with a European average of 0.6 % ( range 0.0 @-@ 1.3 % ) .
The estimates suggest that around 11 million Europeans have tried amphetamines , and about 2 million have used the drug in the last year ( see Table 3 for a summary of the data ) .
Last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.7 % and 1.9 % .
For example , recreational and less intensive and damaging patterns of use among socially wellintegrated users can coexist with intensive use among more marginalised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risky modes of administration , such as injection and smoking .
The EMCDDA indicator on problem drug use ( PDU ) can be used in a restricted sense for amphetamines , where it defines as such the injecting or long duration / regular use of the substance .
Only one Member State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amphetamine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 12000 and 22000 problem amphetamine users ( 4.3 to 7.9 casesper1000 , aged 15 @-@ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem opioid users in the country .
For Italy , the Netherlands and Poland , where data on seizures were unavailable , only data from population surveys were used .
For Croatia , only seizures data were used .
For Norway and Belgium treatment data were unavailable .
The data available for Romania did not permit inferences to be made for the country as a whole .
In the CzechRepublic and Slovakia , methamphetamine is the amphetamine most commonly used .
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
Amphetamine users entering treatment are , on average , around 29 year sold and male .
found for other drugs ( 68 ) .
In most countries , though not in Sweden and Finland , the proportion of new clients entering treatment for primary amphetamine use is greater than the proportion of all clients receiving treatment for this drug .
In contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
Historically , use of this drug in Europe has been concentrated in the CzechRepublic and , to some extent ,

Chapter 4 : Amphetamines , ecstasy and LSD estimate at 0.3 % and the highest at 12 % , reflecting the different experiences of some Member States .
Only these two countries report recent estimates of problem use .
In the last five years , the reported demand for treatment related to methamphetamine use has been increasing in both countries .
In the Czech Republic , 59 % of all drug treatment clients report methamphetamine as their primary drug ( 69 ) .
Clients in treatment for methamphetamine report high rates of injecting drug use : around 50 % in Slovakia and 80 % in the Czech Republic .
Despite the number of ecstasy users in Europe being similar to that of amphetamine , very few are seen by treatment services .
It is estimated that about 9.5 million European adults have tried ecstasy ( 3 % on average ) and that about 3 million ( 0.8 % ) have used it in the last year ( see Table 4 for a summary of the data ) .
Use of the drug in the last year varied across Europe , from 0.2 % to 3.5 % .
On all measures , and as with most other illicit drugs , reported use was far higher among males than among females .
Among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) , lifetime prevalence estimates area little higher ( 0.3 % to 7.1 % ) , although lower prevalence levels are reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Amphetamine use ( last 12 months ) among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 ) in the UnitedKingdom declined substantially between 1996 ( 6.5 % ) and 2002 ( 3.1 % ) , with the figures remaining

In Denmark in 1994 the information refers to " hard drugs , " which was considered mainly amphetamines .
Chapter 4 : Amphetamines , ecstasy and LSD reported by males than females : 42 % and 27 % , respectively ( European Commission , 2007b ) .
However , it should be noted that prevalence was higher among specific subpopulations that were characterised by their countercultural elements and labelled as " alternative . "
Among these sub @-@ populations , prevalence estimates for ecstasy and amphetamine were 54 % and 29 % respectively .
Interventions in recreational settings case in the UnitedKingdom and Denmark , and to some extent in Spain .
Possible changes in the patterns of drug use in other countries ( Germany , France , Italy , Netherlands ) are less clear .
Overall , the interplay between different drugs that may have similar appeal to users remains poorly understood .
Recreational settings
Use of amphetamines and ecstasy in recreational settings
This approach is particularly relevant to interventions targeting settings where both synthetic and stimulant drugs and alcohol are consumed , such as night bars and clubs .
One of the problems in this area is that the relative roles of illicit and licit substances may be difficult to distinguish .
Indeed , harmful use of alcohol is associated with one in every four deaths among young men ( aged 15 @-@ 29 ) and one in 10 among young women ( 79 ) .
Estimates of drug use in these settings are typically high , but are not generalisable to the wider population .
This level of drunkenness was more commonly
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe to medical emergencies .
In most Member States , limited demand is reflected in the limited availability of treatment services specifically targeting users of amphetamine , methamphetamine or ecstasy .
This situation is somewhat different in a few Member States with long @-@ established chronic amphetamine- or methamphetamine @-@ using populations .
In these countries ( principally the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , users of amphetamine or methamphetamine are treated within specialist services .
Treatment options appear to consist of detoxification , followed by individual therapy in an outpatient setting or group therapy in either outpatient or residential settings .
Strategies that address the environment in which young people consume both drugs and alcohol appear to have considerable potential for safeguarding public health and
Therapeutic options with robust evidence of effectiveness are generally lacking to guide the treatment of dependence on psychostimulants , such as amphetamines and cocaine .
As noted in Chapter 5 , no pharmacological agents are currently available to help users to manage abstinence or reduce the cravings associated with psychostimulant dependence .
Furthermore , the literature would suggest that no particular psychosocial intervention has shown strong evidence of effectiveness in helping psychostimulant users to maintain abstinence .

Chapter 5 Cocaine and crack cocaine
994 tonnes of pure cocaine hydrochloride for the year 2007 , of which Colombia accounted for 61 % , Peru 29 % and Bolivia 10 % .
Analysis of the number of laboratories dismantled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before exportation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .
In some EU Member States , the demand for treatment for cocaine use has increased substantially in recent years , and now even exceeds that for opioid treatment in some countries , cities and regions .
Moreover , a substantial proportion of opioid users in treatment report cocaine as their secondary drug , which may be contributing to their problems and can complicate their care .
In many countries , cocaine is also reported in the toxicological analysis of a high proportion of drugrelated deaths , generally in combination with opioids and other substances .
Cocaine produced in the Andean region is then smuggled to Europe from South American countries ( via Brazil , Ecuador , Venezuela ) .
Spain and Portugal remain the major entry points of cocaine in to Europe , the latter 's role having substantially increased since 2005 .
Both the Netherlands and France are reported to be major transit countries for further cocaine distribution in Europe ( Europol , 2007b ) .
Recent reports of cocaine importation via east European countries ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , Russia ) may point to the development of new trafficking routes in this part of Europe .
Cultivation of coca bush , the source of cocaine , continues to be concentrated in a few countries in the Andean region ( 82
Cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after herbal cannabis and cannabis resin .
In 2006 , global seizures of cocaine decreased slightly to 706 tonnes .
For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability , see p.36.
West Africa : now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005 , accounting for 28 % of the European total in 2006 , points to the growing use of the Iberian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market .
Purity and price
It is estimated that almost a quarter of the cocaine trafficked to Europe in 2007 was transited via this region ( UNODC , 2008 ) .
Cocaine is trafficked from west Africa to Europe mainly by sea , with large shipments transported by fishing vessels to unloading sites mainly on the coast of northern Portugal and Galicia in Spain .
Smaller shipments of cocaine are trafficked by air or overland , increasingly associated with smuggling cannabis resin from north Africa .
The growth of the west African cocaine trafficking route has been attributed to several factors .
Patterns of cocaine use can be correspondingly diverse , ranging from the occasional and recreational to the highly compulsive and dependent .
The quantity of cocaine seized has also been increasing over the last decade , but with regular fluctuations .
In 2006 , cocaine seizures in Europe increased to 72 700 cases and the quantity recovered to 121 tonnes ( 84 ) .
Spain continued to be the country reporting the highest seizures , accounting for 58 % of all seizures and 41 % of the quantity intercepted in Europe that year . The huge increase in the

Estimating cocaine use by analysing communal wastewater
It is estimated that around 4 million Europeans have used the drug in the last year ( 1.2 % on average ) , although again national variation between countries is considerable .
The application of recent developments in analytical chemistry to the detection of cocaine in wastewater has introduced a new approach to the monitoring of illicit drug use in the community , known as " sewage epidemiology . "
The method involves measuring the levels of breakdown products of illicit drugs excreted in the urine of consumers .
The levels of breakdown products measured in wastewater are then scaled up to calculate consumption of illicit drugs among the population .
In the case of cocaine , the main metabolite excreted in the urine is benzoylecgonine .
Cocaine use is mainly concentrated among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) .
Sewage epidemiology is still in an early stage of development and , as well as important technical and ethical questions , the information it offers must be integrated in to current research thinking .
These issues are addressed in the new EMCDDA publication on wastewater analysis ( EMCDDA , 2008b ) .
The approach could also have potential as a drug surveillance tool to assist public health and law enforcement officials in identifying patterns of drug use across municipalities of varying sizes .

Problem cocaine use and treatment demand
Studies conducted in recreational settings often report a high prevalence of cocaine use .
Higher prevalence levels were also reported in a 2004 @-@ 05 French survey of 1496 individuals interviewed in five different electronic music settings .
Nearly 35 % of the sample had used cocaine and 6 % crack or freebase cocaine during the last month .
National estimates of problem cocaine use ( injection or long duration / regular use ) are available only for Spain and Italy , and regional estimates are available for the United Kingdom .
Similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
Information for the UnitedKingdom is not directly comparable to that of Spain and Italy , as it is based on crack cocaine use .
In 2004 @-@ 05 , one study estimated the number of problem crack cocaine users in England at 5.7 to 6.4 per 1 000 adult population .
Among school students , overall prevalence levels for cocaine use are much lower than those for cannabis use .
Ever in lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students is 2 % or lower in most countries , rising to 4 % in Spain and 5 % in the UnitedKingdom ( 89
countries ( 91 ) .
Cocaine was also reported as a secondary drug by around 18 % of all drug outpatient clients ( 92 ) .
Elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .

Overall the estimated lifetime prevalence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the USA .
However , at the national level Denmark , Ireland , Spain , Italy and the UnitedKingdom ( England and Wales ) report higher figures than Australia .
The increasing trend in demand for cocaine treatment noted in previous years also appears to be continuing , even if it is disproportionately influenced by a few countries .
The largest increases were reported by Italy and Spain ( 95 ) .
See Figures TDI @-@ 1 and TDI @-@ 3 and Table TDI @-@ 3 ( part ii ) in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Cocaine clients entering outpatient treatment have the highest male to female ratio among drug treatment clients ( five men for every woman ) .
As a result , some cocaine @-@ related problems will go unidentified , and those suffering them may not receive appropriate care .
Most cocaine clients report having started using the drug between the ages of 15 and 24 years ( 99
Health problems associated with powder cocaine , however , are more likely to go unrecognised and may affect users who might not normally consider themselves at risk .
These problems can be aggravated by existing conditions ( e.g. vascular malformations ) and risk factors such as smoking or alcohol use .
Many of the deaths attributed to cocaine are produced through these pathologies .
The first of these are typically more socially integrated , reporting stable housing and employment status , and generally report snorting the drug .
The second is a more marginalised group of clients who are typically smoking or injecting cocaine ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either crack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
In 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
There have been few studies to assess the overall public health impact of cocaine use .
Frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @-@ fatal myocardial infarctions than nonusers ( Qureshi et al . , 2001 ) .
However , it is not possible to generalise directly from this study to Europe .
Currently , our understanding of the possible health impact of increasing cocaine use in Europe remains poorly developed and an important area for future public health inquiry .

Chapter 5 : Cocaine and crack cocaine or re @-@ initiation - a risk for HIV and other blood @-@ borne infections and serious medical , social and criminal problems .
Following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several Member States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adapting their traditionally opioid @-@ oriented services to the varied cocaine and crack @-@ using populations .
However , with the exception of Spain , in 2006 , Member States assessed the availability and accessibility of cocaine @-@ specific treatment programmes as low .
Unlike opioid dependence , no effective pharmacological treatment options are currently available to help cocaine users maintain abstinence or reduce use ( see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine ) .
Experimental therapeutic drugs to reduce cocaine consumption and cravings have shown potential in clinical trials ( e.g. baclofen , tiagabine , topiramate ) .
Modafinil , a central nervous system stimulant , has shown particularly promising results as a psychostimulant substitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential substitute drugs ( e.g. d @-@ amphetamine ) , its abuse liability is low ( Myrick et al . , 2004 ) .
Of the Member States that report high prevalence levels of cocaine or crack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
In 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evaluated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
These programmes target problematic intranasal cocaine users , polydrug users with cocaine problems , as well as women and sex workers using cocaine .
In Italy , a largescale clinical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmaceuticals ( aripiprazole and ropinirole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
By rewarding abstinence , contingency management ( CM ) aims to reduce the reinforcing effects of drugs .
For example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . In this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
This technique repeatedly reinforces the drugfree behaviour of the client and provides a regular goal to be achieved .
Information on the nature of the services provided to problem cocaine users in Europe is scarce .
According to a recent UnitedKingdom report ( NICE , 2007 ) , cocaine @-@ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to opioids .
Adequate investment , appropriate treatment protocols and specialised training needs are , therefore , likely to be key issues for service development in this area .
Immunotherapy for cocaine dependence through a cocaine vaccine ( TA @-@ CD ) is also under investigation .
Once administered , the vaccine induces the production of antibodies that bind to cocaine molecules in the bloodstream and , thereby , allow naturally occurring enzymes to convert them in to inactive molecules .
The results of the initial clinical trials are encouraging , though further studies are required to test the viability of the vaccine as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence .
A qualitative study in six Spanish cities showed that the main substances used among sex workers were alcohol and cocaine .
Drug use was reported as occasional and instrumental in helping to reduce psychological barriers or inhibition , and increase tolerance to long hours of sex work with different clients .
Among the consequences of drug use in prostitutes were unprotected sex and a higher risk of violence by clients .
Severe crack cocaine consumption patterns are also often observed in this group .
The effectiveness of such an approach is uncertain and raises ethical concerns , which are discussed in depth in the forthcoming EMCDDA publication Addiction neurobiology : ethical and social implications .
Sex workers with cocaine and crack cocaine problems are targeted by outreach and harmreduction services .
Problem cocaine use is frequently associated with severe physical and mental health consequences .
As reported in Chapter 4 , Member States are increasingly adopting an integrated approach towards reducing harm related to the use of alcohol and illicit drugs in recreational settings .
Chapter 6 Opioid use and drug injection
Heroin supply and availability via south Asia ( Bangladesh ) ( INCB , 2008a ) .
Within the European Union , the Netherlands and , to a lesser extent , Belgium play an important role as secondary distribution hubs ( Europol , 2008 ) .
Worldwide reported seizures of opioids increased in 2006 to 384 tonnes for opium and to 104 tonnes for heroin and morphine .
In Europe , an estimated 48 200 seizures resulted in the interception of 19.4 tonnes of heroin in 2006 .
The amount of heroin intercepted in an average seizure varied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seizure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( Figure 6 ) .
Over the last 10 years , heroin seizures have been fluctuating downwards in Europe , with a relative peak in 2001 and a record low in 2003 .
Heroin consumed in Europe originates predominantly in Afghanistan , which remains the world leader in illicit opium supply , followed by Myanmar and Mexico .
However , large seizures of morphine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2007a ) .
Global seizures of acetic anhydride ( used in the illicit manufacture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 litres in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 litres ) and Colombia ( 8 800 litres ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 litres ) ( INCB , 2008b ) .
Seizures of 3 @-@ methylfentanyl reported in 2006 in Latvia and Lithuania and reports of increased injecting of

Reitox national focal points .
Moreover , as most studies are based on a localised geographical area , such as a city or district , extrapolation to the national level is often difficult .
For example , in some countries where problem opioid use has historically predominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use at national level during the period 2002 @-@ 06 range roughly between one and six casesper1000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ;
From the relatively limited data available , an estimated average prevalence of problem opioid use of between four and five casesper1000 of the population aged 15 @-@ 64 can be derived .
Assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it implies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem opioid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
Trends and incidence of problem opioid use
Opioid indicators are no longer decreasing
In contrast to trends described in previous annual reports , recent data show some increases in druginduced deaths , heroin seizures and new treatment demands for heroin in the European Union .
In 2003 , the downward trend in the number of druginduced deaths reported in Europe , mostly related to the use of opioids , ceased and between 2003 and 2005 most Member States have been reporting an upward trend .
Numbers of seizures of heroin increased by over 10 % in 16 out of 24 reporting countries between 2003 and 2006 .
After falling for several years , new demands for treatment with heroin as the primary drug have increased in about half of the countries reporting data between 2005 and 2006 .
This may reflect a change in incidence of heroin use beginning a few years earlier , because of the natural time lag between initiation of use and first treatment .
This is an important issue for further investigation as available data do not allow a clear picture to be drawn .
treatment found that primary opioid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
Furthermore , these models can provide only a partial estimate of incidence , as they are based on only those cases that come in to contact with treatment .
Only two countries report recent data , showing different trends .
The EMCDDA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for incidence estimation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( Scalia Tomba et al . , 2008 ) .
Most drug clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other opioids ( 23 % ) and cannabis ( 18 % ) .
Of the 387 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
In most countries , between 50 % and 80 % of all treatment demands are reported to be related to opioid use ; in the remaining countries the proportion varies between 15 % and 40 % ( 109 ) .
Opioids are not only the most frequently reported primary drug among those entering treatment but even more so among those who are already in treatment .
A recent project involving nine countries and focusing on all clients in
Buprenorphine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
In Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of opioids other than heroin or methadone : mainly buprenorphine , painkillers and other opioids ( 112 ) .
Several countries report

Improving the level of information available on this special population is , therefore , an important challenge for the development of health monitoring systems in Europe .
The available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .

Injecting among opioid users entering treatment
Among opioid users entering outpatient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower proportion report injecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .
Changes in the proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment may indicate trends in the wider group of problem opioid users .
An analysis of the treatment demand data for nine countries taking part in a pilot study revealed that around 63 % of all opioid clients ( those already in treatment

that among clients already in treatment the proportion of injectors at treatment entrance was relatively high .
Many countries conduct regularly repeated studies on groups of injectors , usually in the context of infectious disease testing , that are often recruited from a variety of settings in order to maximise generalisability .
Comparisons between countries should be made with caution due to potential biases in selective recruitment to these studies ( 117 ) .
The varying levels of new injectors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initiation as well as increasing injecting incidence among the younger or the older populations .

Opioid clients are generally younger in those countries that have joined the European Union since 2004 and in Ireland , Greece , Austria and Finland ( 118 ) .
A simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem opioid users and the reported number of treatments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving substitution treatment .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
About half of opioid users seeking treatment report initiation before the age of 20 and around one third between the age of 20 and 24 years ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 is uncommon ( 120

Treatment provision and coverage
A buprenorphine / naloxone combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to buprenorphine alone , with the aim of reducing the potential and attractiveness for injecting use .
Treatment for opioid users is mostly conducted in outpatient settings , which can include specialist centres , general practitioners and lowthreshold facilities .
In a few countries , inpatient centres also play a major role , notably Bulgaria , Greece , Finland and Sweden ( 122
Drugfree and substitution treatments for opioid use are available in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway .
In Turkey , the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study .
Prescription of medical heroin ( diamorphine ) , as a treatment option for chronic treatment @-@ resistant opioid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 815 clients in 2006 ) , the UnitedKingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive diamorphine according to a special regulation .
Additionally , a randomised trial of injectable opioids ( RIOTT ) is currently underway in the UnitedKingdom which will assess the effectiveness of injectable diamorphine , injectable methadone and oral methadone .
In February 2008 , it was also decided to introduce a diamorphine prescription scheme in Denmark .
Technical information on the substance is available on the EMEA website ( http : / / www.emea.europa.eu / humandocs / Humans / EPAR / suboxone / suboxone.htm ) .
Substitution treatment , generally integrated with psychosocial care , is typically provided at specialised outpatient centres and in shared @-@ care arrangements with office @-@ based general practitioners . The available data

The Danish National Board of Health , after a review of substitution guidelines , has now urged general practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine instead of methadone .
Treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
However , a report issued by the European Commission ( 2007a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of intervening in this setting .
Reviews of randomised controlled trials and observational studies conclude that methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) and buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) can both be effective for the management of opioid dependence .
A recent Cochrane review concluded , however , that buprenorphine is less effective than methadone delivered at adequate doses ( Mattick et al . , 2008 ) .
A number of studies have also found that diamorphine maintenance can be effective for people failing to respond to MMT ( Schulte et al . , in press ) .
More positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
In many countries , detoxification is the preferred and sometimes the only treatment option available .
Substitution treatment is offered in theory in most countries , but data indicate that few drug users receive it in practice .
A numberofcountries have recently reported making improvements to their treatment guidelines .
In Croatia , Denmark and Scotland , substitution programmes have been reviewed and guidelines have been revised to increase treatment quality and prevent diversion in to

Chapter 7 Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
Drugrelated infectious diseases
Infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B and Care among the most serious health consequences of drug use .
The EMCDDA is systematically monitoring HIV and hepatitis B and C among injecting drug users ( prevalence of antibodies , or other specific markers in the case of hepatitis B ) .
The data have to be interpreted with caution , given several methodological limitations in the different data systems ( 125 ) .
Between 2001 and 2006 , no strong increases have been observed in any country in the population rate of HIV infection .
Where some slight increase is observed ( e.g. Bulgaria , Ireland ) , this remained below one additional case per million population per year .
By the end of 2006 , the incidence of diagnosed HIV infection among injecting drug users ( IDUs ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
In Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
Trends in HIV infection
Data on newly diagnosed cases related to injecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @-@ 02 , which was due to outbreaks in Estonia , countries , HIV prevalence remained unchanged during the period .
In five countries ( Bulgaria , Germany , Spain ,

Italy , Latvia ) prevalence showed statistically significant decreases , all based on national samples .
Although in two of these , regional increases were also reported : in Bulgaria , one city , Sofia ; and in Italy , eight out of 21 regions and one city .
The high annual rate of new HIV diagnoses related to injecting drug use in Estonia , Latvia and Portugal suggests that transmission is still occurring in these countries at high levels .
The comparison of trends in newly diagnosed infections related to injecting drug use with trends in HIV prevalence among IDUs suggests that the incidence of HIV infection related to injecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
See Tables INF @-@ 109 and INF @-@ 110 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The most recent data indicate that the incidence of HIV infection among IDUs is generally low in the European Union .
However , vigilance is needed as some Member States continue to show high rates of new HIV infections linked to injecting drug use , and the situation is even more worrying in some neighbouring countries .
HCV antibody levels among national samples of IDUs in 2005 @-@ 06 vary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in excess of 40 % .
In neighbouring countries to the east of the European Union , the situation is of particular concern .
In the two largest countries , Russia and Ukraine , the number of newly diagnosed cases is high and still increasing .
Within countries , HCV prevalence levels can vary considerably , reflecting both regional differences and the characteristics of the sampled population .
For example , in the United Kingdom , local studies report levels between 29 % and 59 % , while in Italy different regional estimates range from around 40 % to 96 % .
While estimates generated from non @-@ probability samples must always be taken with caution , the variations in prevalence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes .
Furthermore , understanding the factors responsible for differential levels of infection is likely to inform the development of better intervention strategies .
Recent studies ( 2005 @-@ 06 ) typically report prevalence levels of between 20 % and 50 % , although with considerable variation between samples .
In 2005 @-@ 06 , six of the 11 countries providing data on IDUs reported anti @-@ HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % ( 133 ) .
The proportion of IDUs among all notified cases of hepatitis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vaccination programmes targeted at IDUs .
In the case of hepatitis C , the proportion of IDUs among notified cases has declined in five countries , but has increased in
Access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade .
As a result many of those who become infected with the virus will not have the advantage of early treatment and care .
They may also contribute to the spread of HIV by unknowingly exposing others to the risk of infection .
In addition , the quality of the data collected by the HIV surveillance systems is diminished .
Preliminary data suggest that access to antiretroviral treatment and care by IDUs is disproportionately low ( Donoghoe et al . , 2007 ) .
Effective antiviral treatment approaches need to take account of the specific situation and needs of IDUs .
To improve the access to HIV testing and treatment , the EMCDDA has developed specific guidelines for offering annual voluntary medical examination to IDUs , including
1 testing for HIV and viral hepatitis (

Transmission of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) continues among IDUs in Europe , among whom rates of active HBV infection ( prevalence of HBsAg ) remain high in most countries , compared to the general population ( 1 ) .
Vaccination is considered the most effective measure to prevent hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection and its consequences .
In line with the 1991 WHO recommendation , most , but not all EU Member States have adopted universal vaccination against this virus .
Infant vaccination policies , however , will mostly affect future generations of drug users .
To reduce the spread of the infection sooner , over half the EU Member States have adopted vaccination programmes specifically targeting injecting drug users and / or prisoners .
Nevertheless , coverage of these programmes varies between countries , and a third of EU Member States still report no vaccination programme specifically for drug users .
Prisons are important settings for interventions targeting infectious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see Chapter 2 ) .
Vaccination programmes targeting drug users often face the problem of low compliance resulting in non @-@ completion of vaccination courses .
Repeated offers of vaccination and extra doses for those with decreased immune response may also help to achieve higher immunisation results .
This may require EU Member States to review and possibly fine @-@ tune their policies in order to decrease the occurrence of chronic HBV infection and its consequences .

Drug use is one of the major causes of health problems and death among young people in Europe .
Druginduced deaths
The EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths ( 136 ) refers to those deaths that are directly caused ( poisonings or overdoses ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substances present is an illicit
In Bulgaria , a mobile surgery in Bourgas , on the Black Sea , provided 750 consultations in 2006 .
See the DUP tables in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
During the period 1990 @-@ 2005 , between 6 500 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States , adding up to about 130 000 deaths .
These figures should be considered as a minimum estimate ( 138 ) .
Moreover , many druginduced deaths are , in fact , polydrug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
Rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 16 European countries and over 40 per million in five countries .
Among males aged 15 @-@ 39 years , the mortality rates are , on average and in most countries , twice as high ( averaging 44 deaths per million in Europe ) .
In 2005 @-@ 06 , druginduced deaths accounted for 3.5 % of all deaths among Europeans aged 15 @-@ 39 years , and for more than 7 % in eight countries ( 139 ) ( Figure 11 ) .
The second component is broader and covers deaths which cannot be directly attributable to the pharmacological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @-@ term consequences of infectious diseases , interactions with mental health issues ( e.g. suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e.g. road traffic accidents ) .
There are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circumstantial reasons ( e.g. violence related to the drug trade ) .
There is still limited research on the morbidity and other consequences of non @-@ fatal overdoses and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .
Studies have estimated that there could be between 20 and 25 non @-@ fatal overdoses for each fatal one .
Deaths related to opioids
The EMCDDA 's current approach to reporting on overall drugrelated mortality is based on estimating mortality rates among cohorts of problem drug users .
However , other approaches are being explored whereby data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attributable to drugs in a community ( see " Overall drugrelated mortality , " p . 86 ) .
Opioid overdose is one of the leading causes of death among young people in Europe , particularly among males in urban areas ( 140
In general , druginduced deaths occur shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
Improvements in the quality and reliability of European data in recent years have allowed better descriptions of overall and national trends , and most countries have now adopted a case definition in line with that of the

The calculations of population mortality rates are based on national populations for 2005 as reported by Eurostat .

The majority of opioid overdose deaths ( 60 @-@ 95 % ) are male , mostly between 20 and 40 years of age , with a mean age in most countries in the mid @-@ thirties ( 142
Research shows that substitution treatment reduces the risk of fatal overdose . Each year , however , a number of deaths
Most of these deaths are attributable to the misuse of methadone diverted from hospitals , pharmacies , practitioners and pain management physicians , while only a limited number of them are attributed to methadone obtained from substitution programmes ( 146 ) .
Research has demonstrated that the risk of overdose decreases substantially while heroin users are in methadone substitution treatment .
Methadone , however , is identified in the toxicological reports of some deaths .
This does not imply the existence , in all cases , of a direct causal link , as other drugs or factors may be present .
The very high potency of this substance may elevate the risk of drug overdose , while it may be overlooked in toxicological screening .
Cocaine @-@ induced deaths are more difficult to define and identify than those related to opioids ( see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine ) .
Deaths directly caused by pharmacological overdose seem to be uncommon , and these are usually linked with very large cocaine doses .
Otherwise , most cocaine deaths seem to be the result of the chronic toxicity of the drug leading to cardiovascular and neurological complications .
The role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @-@ related .
The dramatic expansion of methadone treatment in Europe has not been reflected in a parallel rise of methadonerelated deaths .
This represents a decrease in the methadonerelated death rate from 13 per 1 000 patient years in 1993 to 3.1 per 1 000 patient years in 2004 .
While similar studies in other countries would be very useful , the available evidence suggests that methadonerelated deaths are more likely to be linked to deficiencies in prescribing practices than to overall levels of substitution treatment .
Most deaths with " presence of ecstasy " are reported in the United Kingdom , but in many cases the drug has not been identified as the direct cause of death .
Trends in druginduced deaths
Europe had a very high mortality rate compared to peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
Trends in druginduced deaths over the period 2001 to 2005 / 06 are more difficult to describe .
A number of factors could be associated with this , including : increases in polydrug use , a possible growth in the availability of heroin or an ageing population of chronic drug users ( 152
A recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
It should be noted that the proportion of AIDS deaths can be considerably higher in countries with a high HIV prevalence among drug users .
In the absence of data from some of the larger countries , overall estimates of the number of druginduced deaths for 2006 remain provisional .
However , the available data from 18 countries are suggestive of a small decrease compared to 2005 .
This observation requires further investigation , as it could point to increases in the numbers of young people using opioids in these countries .
Cohort studies area valuable tool for estimating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an overview at national level .
In one of these approaches , mortality rates are extrapolated from cohort studies to local ( Bargagli et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( Cruts et al . , 2008 ) .

Chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths
Reducing drugrelated deaths
The reduction of drugrelated deaths is a goal of most national drug strategies , but few countries have adopted action plans or provided systematic guidance on measures to be taken .
However , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clinical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of drugrelated deaths .
Disease
The study was conducted among a cohort of 10 454 heroin users entering public treatment services from 1998 to 2001 , and evaluated retention in treatment and overdose mortality .
The data are from a study based on a sample of 501 drug users admitted for treatment for drug addiction during the period 1981 @-@ 91 .
A total of 189 deaths were recorded up to 2003 , of which the cause of death could not be identified in 14 cases .
and EuroHIV ( End @-@ year report for 2005 , 2006 ) , it can be estimated that , in 2003 , over 2 600 people died of
AIDS mortality peaked in the mid @-@ 1990s and has decreased substantially following the introduction and increased coverage of HAART .
And , in many countries , overdose mortality is considerably higher
The number of deaths from other causes ( e.g. consequences of other infectious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and estimation in this area ( see preceding section ) .
Suicide appears to be a frequent cause of death among drug users .
The year 2003 was taken as the most recent year for which information from almost all Member States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat .
For detailed information on sources , numbers and computations see Table DRD @-@ 5 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
Drug injectors , in particular , may suffer from high levels of somatic disease , notably chronic infections of the liver , which further increase their vulnerability .
Elevated risk of druginduced death on completion of prison sentences or treatment attributed to drug overdoses or , more generally , to substance use disorders .
Coroners " records cited the involvement of opioids in 95 % of the druginduced deaths , benzodiazepines in 20 % , cocaine in 14 % and tricyclic antidepressants in 10 % of cases .
Of the 442 deaths that occurred among the sample during this period , the majority ( 59 % ) were drug @-@ related .
In the year following release , the druginduced mortality rate was 5.2 per 1 000 men and 5.9 per 1 000 women .
In the period immediately after release , expected rates were exceeded by more than 10 times for women and more than eight times for men .
Continuity of care and rehabilitation of drug users that are released from prison are also undeveloped in many countries .
Improvements in these two areas could represent valuable opportunities to prevent drugrelated deaths .
Chapter 8 New drugs and emerging trends
Introduction there was a need to control BZP , but the control measures should be appropriate to the relatively low risk posed by the substance .
In March 2008 , the Council adopted a decision defining BZP as a new psychoactive substance which is to be made subject to control measures and criminal provisions .
In March 2007 , the EMCDDA and Europol reported to the Commission on the active monitoring of 1- ( 3 @-@ chlorophenyl ) piperazine ( mCPP ) ( 159 ) .
The use of new psychoactive substances can have important public health and policy implications , but monitoring emerging trends is a considerable challenge .
New patterns of drug use are difficult to detect because , typically , they first emerge at low levels , and in specific localities or among restricted sub @-@ groups of the population .
Few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to this kind of behaviour and the methodological difficulties presented by monitoring this kind of drug use are considerable .
EU action on new psychoactive substances
The Council decision on new psychoactive substances ( 157
During 2007 , a total of 15 new psychoactive substances were notified for the first time through the earlywarning system to the EMCDDA and Europol .
The group of newly notified substances is diverse and , besides new synthetic drugs , includes medicinal products and naturally occurring substances .
Nine of the newly reported compounds were synthetic drugs similar to those listed in Schedules I and II of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances .
They included substances from known chemical groups such as phenethylamines , tryptamines and piperazines , as well as substances with a less common chemical make @-@ up .
The group is equally divided between substances that have pronounced hallucinogenic effects and those that exhibit predominantly stimulant properties .
The risk assessment concluded that due to its stimulant properties , risk to health and lack of medical benefits ,
New substances under control example on the working methods of online shops ; the way that they respond to users " demands , and new trends among young people .
To identify current developments in the online drug market , the EMCDDA conducted a snapshot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
The results of that study a represented here .
Online shops
Of these substances , mCPP had been actively monitored by the EMCDDA and Europol , and BZP had been the subject of a risk assessment in 2007 .
Within the European Union , the majority of online shops identified in the snapshot study are based in the UnitedKingdom and the Netherlands and , to a lesser extent , Germany and Austria .
Online shops based in Europe advertise over 200 psychoactive products .
The most commonly encountered " legal highs " are Salvia divinorum , kratom ( Mitragyna speciosa ) , Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ) , hallucinogenic mushrooms ( EMCDDA , 2006 ) , and a variety of " party pills . "
Various plants with psychoactive properties are also being controlled .
Among the plants placed on the list are khat ( qat , Catha edulis ) and Salvia divinorum .
Khat is now controlled by 11 countries in Europe ( a 2005 risk assessment in the UnitedKingdom recommended against control ) .
In 2006 , Sweden added salvinorine @-@ A , the main active principle of Salvia divinorum , to its list ; the plant has also been put under control in Germany in 2008 .
In the same period , Tabernanthe iboga has been added to the list of controlled substances in France , following legal control of the active ingredient , ibogaine , in Belgium , Denmark and Sweden .
Internet study methodology
Internet - a marketplace for psychoactive substances
To obtain a snapshot , Internet searches were conducted in January 2008 using multilingual keywords and the search engine Google ( http : / / www.google.com ) .
A total of 68 EU @-@ based online shops were identified selling various types of " legal highs . "
They were stratified according to their country of origin .
EU country code domains ( e.g. ES , FR , DE ) or other indications of being EU @-@ based ( e.g. contact address ) were used for the identification of the country of origin .
A random sample of 25 online shops was selected for detailed analysis .
Sampling fractions in each stratum ( country of origin ) were proportional to those of the total sample of online shops .
Online shops that sold exclusively to the trade , rather than to the consumer , were excluded as were those that sold only hallucinogenic mushrooms .
The Internet offers a window on the world of the drug user through online forums and chat rooms as well as the sites of online shops selling psychoactive alternatives to controlled substances .

Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe in the body , and there is currently no readily available toxicological test to determine which of the two substances has been consumed .
For example , the average price of a 1 gram dose of GBL purchased in bulk on the Internet varies from EUR 0.09 to EUR 2 .
GHB and its precursor GBL : follow @-@ up
Both GHB and GBL have a steep dose @-@ response curve , with rapid onset of symptoms , which greatly increases the risks associated with illicit use .
Nausea , vomiting and various degrees of impaired consciousness are the main adverse affects in most reported cases of GHB intoxication .
However , the frequent presence of other drugs may complicate the clinical presentation .
A Dutch study of 72 GHB users reported that the majority had passed out at least once while on GHB and some had done so frequently ( Korf et al . , 2002 ) .
In a survey of GHB and GBL users in the United Kingdom , adverse reactions were reported to be more common in club settings than in private homes ( Sumnall et al . , 2008 ) .
GHB occurs naturally in the human body , but is also used as a medicine and as a recreational drug .
Concerns quickly arose about the health risks associated with its use .
In particular , anxieties arose about the potential for surreptitiously adding GHB to drinks ( commonly referred to as " drink spiking " ) to facilitate sexual assault .
However , there is a lack of forensic evidence for this , and establishing it is difficult due to the narrow time window for detecting GHB in body fluids .
However , the association of GHB with drug @-@ facilitated sexual assault may have contributed to a relatively " negative image " of the substance ( EMCDDA , 2008c ) .
Although GHB is associated with only a very small proportion of all drug intoxication emergencies requiring hospital or ambulance emergency services , numbers appear to have increased since 2000 .
In Amsterdam , in 2005 , the proportion of requests for emergency assistance that required transportation to hospital was higher for cases related to GHB / GBL than to those involving other drugs .
GBL is rapidly converted in to GHB
Chapter 8 : New drugs and emerging trends
This suggests that GBL use may be more common than was previously thought ( Wood et al . , 2008 ) .
1,4 @-@ BD ) under drug control or equivalent legislation and discussions about possible further controls are in progress in the United Kingdom .
Due to its rapid elimination from the body , it is difficult to establish GHB / GBL as a cause of intoxication or death .
Furthermore , there is an absence of an accurate and comparable system for recording the number of deaths and non @-@ fatal emergencies related to the use of GHB and its precursors .
Interventions for prevention and harmreduction in response to the use of GHB / GBL are commonly provided by national and community drugs projects that target nightlife settings .
These interventions usually consist of training club staff and disseminating information about the risks of using GHB and other drugs .
Such interventions often take place in conjunction with other interventions related to " club drugs " and use of alcohol and drug combinations ( EMCDDA , 2008e ) .

European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
Annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is one of the European Union 's decentralised agencies .
Established in 1993 and based in Lisbon , it is the central source of comprehensive information on drugs and drug addiction in Europe .
The EMCDDA collects , analyses and disseminates factual , objective , reliable and comparable information on drugs and drug addiction .
In doing so , it provides its audiences with an evidencebased picture of the drug phenomenon at European level .
The Centre 's publications area prime source of information for a wide range of audiences including policymakers and their advisers ; professionals and researchers working in the field of drugs ; and , more broadly , the media and general public .
The annual report presents the EMCDDA 's yearly overview of the drug phenomenon in the EU and is an essential reference book for those seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .

Furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitutes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the EMCDDA 's future activities .
This report provides a timely and detailed assessment of Europe 's drug situation , and we are grateful to our staff who have worked so hard to produce it .
As well as making an important contribution to a mature and informed debate on the drug problem , the existence of this monitoring system , we believe , results in better and more effective policies .
Such policies are increasingly necessary , as the challenges in this area grow ever more complex .
A common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confronted .
The conference also identified a number of important issues that are echoed in the analysis presented here .
Our information systems need to perform better in identifying , tracking and reporting on new trends .
In achieving this , however , it is essential that our reporting remains accurate , grounded and non @-@ alarmist .
Also highlighted was the need to unite in our analysis both supply @-@ side and demand @-@ side issues .
In this year 's report , we give greater prominence to an analysis of supply @-@ side indicators and the drug market .
We do this cautiously , as insufficient efforts have yet been made to improve the quality , reliability and comparability of the European data set in this area .
This is now widely recognised , and we are committed to working with our national and European partners to address this issue .
This year , the EMCDDA celebrated 15 years of collecting information and reporting on the European drug problem .
To mark this event we held a conference entitled " Identifying Europe 's information needs for effective drug policy . "
Finally , it should be noted that the European Union and the United Nations have renewed their drug policy documents almost in parallel in late 2008 and early 2009 .
The new EU action plan on drugs and the new UN political declaration and action plan both reflect the international commitment to reduce drug use and the harms it can cause .
To achieve these objectives constitutes a major challenge and will only be achieved if the planned actions are widely implemented .
Monitoring and evaluation are key elements in this process , as they allow us to keep our policies on course and chart the progress made .
Nowhere else exists such a large group of culturally different countries who demonstrate a common determination in improving their understanding and responses to this complex social problem .
This can be seen in the development of a transversal drug monitoring system that encompasses 30 countries with a combined population of more than half a billion people .
It can also be seen in the EU drugs strategy and action plan , tools that are designed to take stock of the information available and elaborate it into practical and collective action .
We are confident that our current report contributes to this process .

Commentary Hitting a moving target - the challenge of developing a pragmatic policy response to a changing drug problem
Policy consensus permits a more targeted drug action plan to be moving closer to the European model .
The reporting mechanism developed to assess the implementation of the UNGASS action plans has been criticised .
But with its demise , important areas of work , particularly those concerning demand reduction measures remain outside of the existing global reporting framework .
This issue is likely to be an important topic for the forthcoming session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs .
Law enforcement practice confronted by competing policy objectives
This report covers an important period for drug policy , both in Europe and beyond .
Although attention is often given to the differences that exist between Member States in their drug policies , from a historical perspective the considerable agreement that is now evident in discussions at European level is striking .
This has permitted a new EU action plan that can be described as pragmatic , focused and targeted .
This approach is concretely illustrated in the attention given to specific areas of practice such as the prevention of drugrelated deaths , working in prison settings and improving the quality of treatment and other interventions .
The number of violations of drug laws reported in Europe continues to grow .
And although the data are difficult to interpret , this observation raises questions about the extent to which law enforcement practice is in step with policy objectives in this area .
In this debate , Europe has provided a strong voice for drug policies that are balanced , scientifically grounded and humane .
This has helped to ensure that , in the final agreement , the key progressive elements of the original 1998 UNGASS documents were preserved .
The USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
Broadly speaking , the European policy debate has moved towards the view that priority should be given to interdiction activities targeting the supply rather than the use of drugs .
Reflecting this , in some countries the legal penalties applicable to supply @-@ related offences have been raised or minimum tariffs have been introduced .
The extent to which this shift in emphasis away from users and towards drug suppliers is being translated into policing practice is difficult to gauge .
Only in a few countries do offences related to drug supply outnumber those for drug possession .
Overall , the number of supply @-@ related offences has increased ; but the number of offences related to possession or use of drugs has also increased , and to an even greater degree .
As well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe integrated package of care .
This can be seen , both conceptually and in practice .
For example , harmreduction and treatment interventions are increasingly linked and offered by the same providers .
The in @-@ depth review on sentencing for drug law offences in Europe that accompanies this report explores what happens to those who violate drug laws .
Custodial sentences are common for supply @-@ related offences , but they tend to be given at the lower end of the available tariffs , averaging 3 years or less .
This finding has implications for the development of minimum sentencing guidelines , if they are intended to deter highlevel career criminals from becoming involved in drug supply .
Although progress has been made in treating drug users in Europe , it is uneven , both in terms of the substances addressed and geographical coverage .
The greatest advances have been seen in the area of opioid substitution treatment , with the treated population now in the region of 650 000 and growing .
However , eastern Europe as a whole only contributes to a small proportion of this total , suggesting that there is a need for an expansion of services in some countries .
A lesson that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practitioners can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
Shared care arrangements with specialised centres not only provide support to general practitioners , but also assure treatment quality .
In most countries , custodial sentences are rarely handed out for drug use or possession .
That said , a small percentage of those appearing in court will get an immediate prison sentence , possibly because of aggravating circumstances .
This means that increasing numbers of drug users come into contact with the criminal justice system only to receive an administrative or minor sanction .
Some countries have developed innovative approaches in this area , but overall these are still rare .
Despite the fact that in most countries it is theoretically possible to continue or start substitution treatment within the prison setting , in practice this is often difficult .
Given the number of drug users within prisons in Europe , there is a pressing need to expand treatment opportunities of all types within this setting .
This fact is recognised in the EU action plan , but currently remains a neglected area in most countries .
As those charged with drug offences are likely to be a diverse group , needs assessment is a particularly important issue for service development in this area .
Developing a workable model to ensure appropriate referral trajectories is likely to pose an organisational challenge . Portugal has addressed this problem somewhat differently .
The use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dissuasion of drug abuse . "
The tribunal can issue fines , but sanctioning is not its main objective .
For drugs other than opioids , the availability of services and our understanding of what constitutes effective care are less well developed in Europe .
In addition , developments in neuroscience have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addiction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
Examples here include a cocaine vaccine , now undergoing a large @-@ scale trial in Europe .
Treatment and health interventions : from " one fits all " towards a toolbox of targeted measures
Services for drug users in Europe are becoming increasingly diversified and offered as part of an

Commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @-@ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young males . This represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
The estimates presented here relate to the adult population ( 15 @-@ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
For the complete set of data and information on the methodology see the accompanying statistical bulletin .
Lifetime prevalence : at least 74 million ( 22 % of European adults )
Country variation in last year use : overall range 0.4 % to 14.6 %
Subsequently , the situation began to stabilise , and the most recent data strongly support the analysis presented in last year 's report , of an overall decline in the use of this drug .
Patterns found here are likely later to feed through into older age cohorts .
Interestingly , just as different temporal patterns could be seen in the upward trend in cannabis use in the past , this pattern now appears to be repeating itself in reverse .
The United Kingdom , for example , one of the first countries to record high prevalence levels was also one of the earliest to report a decline in use .
This pattern is now seen in most other west European countries .
In eastern Europe , levels of use were still increasing in most countries until recently .
However , even in these countries , there are signs of stabilisation in the youth population and , if the pattern seen elsewhere is repeated , a subsequent decline could be expected .
Understanding the factors that influence the popularity of a drug such as cannabis is clearly important .
However , caution should be used in inferring any simple causal explanations .
Standing out in the European picture is a small group of countries , mainly in the north or south of Europe , where levels of cannabis use have remained low and stable for some time .
Last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lifetime users Last month use : less than 1 million
Country variation in last year use : overall range 0.0 % to 1.3 %
Problem opioid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
Principal drug in more than 50 % of all drug treatment requests
About 650 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in 2007
A caveat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
The number of new cannabis treatment demands may now be stabilising , after rising steadily for several years .
Although to what extent this reflects patterns of use or the capacity of services remains unclear .
The EMCDDA estimates that somewhere between 2 % and 2.5 % of young adults are using cannabis on a daily
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a diminishing problem trend in heroin @-@ related problems is no longer sustained .
And , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug are considerable .
Any indications that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
Polydrug use and concomitant alcohol problems are now the defining elements of the European drug problem
In drug prevention , it has long been understood that substance use problems are best addressed holistically and in the context of healthy lifestyles and informed choices .
In contrast , the discourse on drug use is more often substance specific .
It is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @-@ dimensional perspective is becoming increasingly unhelpful in understanding the developing nature of patterns of substance use in Europe .
Individuals who use drugs almost never restrict their consumption to a single substance .
In Europe today , polydrug patterns are the norm , and the combined use of different substances is responsible for , or complicates , most of the problems we face .
And it applies equally to the drug market .
Actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly devalued if they simply open the door for the use of a substitute , which may be even more damaging .
There is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substances that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
In the United Kingdom , a country with a large cocaine market , recent falls in purity have been considerable .
These data could suggest declining cocaine availability , but other information puts this conclusion into question .
However , there is evidence of the further diffusion of the drug into other countries . Treatment demands related to cocaine are also growing .
It will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the availability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
Heroin still accounts for the greatest share of morbidity and mortality related to drug use in Europe .
Use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
Following marked decreases , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and proportion of treatment demands related to opioid drugs .
Data on drugrelated deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreasing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Data on the numbers of drug law offences and seizures also show increases .
Worryingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be diffusing into new populations .
Altogether , it must be viewed as disappointing that the positive analysis of the declining
Among the young , multiple substance consumption can increase the risks of acute problems and is predictive of developing a chronic drug habit in later life .
Among older , regular drug users , polydrug use is a major issue in drug overdose , it complicates drug treatment and is associated with violence and offending .
The choice of drugs available to consumers in Europe is also growing .
Additionally , it has become recognised that a defining factor in Europe 's substance use problem is the concomitant consumption of alcohol .
This too can be seen across every age group .
Among schoolchildren , the latest data show a strong association between binge drinking and drug use . Binge
Commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem drinking also often goes hand in hand with recreational drug use , increasing the risks of negative outcomes among young adults .

effects on the availability and use of other substances .
For example , there are some signs that methamphetamine may be displacing amphetamine in parts of northern Europe .
Again , market factors and precursor chemicals appear important here , with methamphetamine production sites appearing now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilitates the import of precursors , in this case 1 @-@ phenyl @-@ 2 @-@ propanone ( BMK ) , from outside of the European Union .
The situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible outward diffusion of methamphetamine use beyond the Czech Republic .
In this country , methamphetamine problems are long established , but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption .
There is also some evidence that methamphetamine use is growing quickly in some of the countries bordering the European Union .
The speed at which problems can develop is illustrated by Slovakia , which provides a recent case study of a country where methamphetamine use has grown significantly .
The Internet and marketing : is " spice " a taste of things to come ?
Until 2007 , most ecstasy tablets analysed in Europe contained 3,4 @-@ methylenedioxy @-@ methamphetamine ( MDMA ) or another ecstasy @-@ like substance .
In up to half of all tablets analysed in these countries , no MDMA or any of its analogues were found .
It cannot yet be said if this development is a temporary digression or marks a more significant transition in the ecstasy market .
Changes in the ecstasy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals , and these efforts may also have important
This year , the EMCDDA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harmreduction interventions , the web @-@ based approaches have considerable potential .
Added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicines are those about the appearance of a range of supposedly " legal " alternatives to controlled psychoactive substances .
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe obscure research compounds , some are extremely potent , and little is known about their effects on humans .
This market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
New substances appearing on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experimental chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans .
Other innovations include the development of distinct brands and the use of attractive packaging .
A notable example of this is the herbal mixtures that have been marketed under the " spice " label .
Numerous brands of " spice " have been found with different packaging and different ingredient lists .
Forensic analysis , however , has largely failed to detect the plant @-@ based substances declared on the labels , but did identify in some samples synthetic cannabinoids that had been added to the mixtures .
These substances were not among the listed ingredients , and would therefore have been consumed unknowingly .
The cannabinoids found are relatively
Attempts to circumvent drug control by marketing unregulated substitutes are not new .
" Spice " may also provide us with a warning of problems to come .
The ability of sophisticated chemists , often located outside of European jurisdictions , to cheaply conduct organic synthesis , potentially provides access to a considerable number of psychoactive substances .
Moreover , as some of these substances may have legitimate uses or be sold supposedly for legitimate purposes , they can fall between drug control and trade regulation .

Other topics addressed are the recent adoption and evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans , new data and trends on drugrelated public expenditure and developments regarding drugrelated research in Europe .
For some nations , the problem declined but for others it worsened , in some cases substantially .
New UN political declaration and plan of action
A few individuals make great fortunes , but these account for only a small portion of the total revenue .
Policies towards sellers and traffickers have toughened .
The enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
The European Union and its Member States played a leading role in the UNGASS review .
Political declaration and plan of action on international cooperation towards an integrated and balanced strategy to counter the world drug problem .
The new EU action plan identifies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving coordination , cooperation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international cooperation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . The new plan is more
EU drugs action plan ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) : new features
The new UN document is similar in content to the original UNGASS declarations and action plans agreed in 1998 .
It includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which reviews current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN Member States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
Through setting up a " European Action on Drugs , " the action plan aims to stimulate European civil society 's commitment about and action on drug problems .
The action plan also calls on Member States to involve civil society at all appropriate levels of drug policy .
It also examined the action plan 's impact on the national drug policies of EU Member States and looked at recent trends in Europe 's drug situation .
Most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Member States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
The evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives attained , progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan .
Moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that echo those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing convergence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
A relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
A better reflection of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursued in external agreements and programmes .

evaluator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of reflection in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
National drug strategies and action plans
Civil society and drug policymaking
Drug strategies and action plans are now essential instruments of national drug policies in Europe .
All but one of the 30 countries monitored by the EMCDDA have adopted such documents , which they renew periodically .
In 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
A key priority of the plan is to dissuade young people from beginning to use drugs by reaffirming the prohibition of drug use and informing young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
The involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
In May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Drugs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 2008a ) .
Ten other EU Member States had national drug policy documents expiring in 2008 .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of finalising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @-@ 08 programme with a 1 @-@ year action plan .
The contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UNGASS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on Narcotic Drugs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU Member States .
policy documents .
In most cases , a progress report based on data collected from service providers and ministries involved in drug policy is submitted to the government or parliament .
Most countries could provide data on central government expenditure , and seven also reported expenditure by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
Labelled and unlabelled expenditure
In some cases , the final report is a summary of annual implementation reviews ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
Of the countries taking the more in @-@ depth approach to evaluation , two ( Luxembourg , Cyprus ) have decided to work with external evaluators from outside the country .
Labelled expenditure is the planned drugrelated public expenditure made by the general government of the state .
Of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only labelled expenditure .
Drug policy evaluations face considerable difficulties in their attempts to link the outputs of drug strategies or action plans with changes in the drug situation .
Nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
The EMCDDA is also developing guidelines to help Member States assess and interpret the results of their drug policy documents .
Not all drugrelated expenditure is identified as such in national budgets .
In most countries , the amount expended in some drugrelated activities is embedded in other programmes and interventions ( e.g. overall police operations budget , or interventions targeting both licit and illicit substances ) .
In these cases , such " unlabelled expenditure " must be estimated by a cost @-@ modelling approach .
The results of earlier studies show that , in most cases , unlabelled expenditure represents the greater part of the national expenditure on the drugs problem .
Estimating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illicit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
Estimates of public expenditure are based on government budgets and accountancy documents .
However , estimating the total expenditure incurred in implementing national
Public expenditure related to drugs can be categorised according to the classification of the functions of government ( COFOG ) system ( EMCDDA , 2008e ) .
In these three countries , " health " received the highest proportion of the total disbursement , followed by " public order and safety " ( Table 1 ) .
In contrast , for those countries providing COFOG data for unlabelled
The COFOG classification has three hierarchical levels . At the first level , government expenditure is broken down into 10 functions .

During this period , about a quarter of the texts authorised or regulated the use of substances such as methadone and buprenorphine .
Halfway through the period , two EU instruments gave added impetus to these processes .
Needle and syringe programmes
In Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exempts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of syringes dispensed .
In a few countries , guidance is issued to the police on appropriate law enforcement practice near needle and syringe outlets .
Overall , police confiscation of sterile syringes or needles is reported to be rare across the European Union .
Penalties for trafficking
Since then , four more countries have passed laws to bring basic trafficking penalties into line with the decision .
In 1999 , Ireland created the new offence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EUR 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
In 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece

Analysis of drugs research in the European Union published by the EMCDDA in 2008 ( 10 ) .
This year , references to national research in the latest Reitox reports are analysed to provide an insight into the research recently conducted in European countries .
Also reported on in this section is a study on drugrelated research in the EU released this year by the European Commission .
Research projects in Member States
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Reitox national reports .
The United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
The report noted prevention , legal frameworks and interdiction as other fields disproportionately underresearched , while research on epidemiological topics was found to be more common ( 11 ) .
The study found that , although comprehensive expertise exists in Member States , improved data comparability between countries and increased visibility of research should be pursued .
Among the subject areas that appeared to attract considerably less research attention were : determinants and risk and protective factors , mechanisms and effects of drugs , supply and markets , and methodological issues .
The results of this analysis , while limited in scope , give support to the new EU action plan 's calls for increased
Participation in European research activities was found to vary considerably between countries , with much of the international cooperation taking place on an informal basis .
However , the study emphasised that drugrelated research can be facilitated by European and international networks of researchers .
Introduction in all these countries .
The effectiveness of this type of intervention , however , is not supported by the available evidence .
However , interventions with better scientific foundations , such as prevention programmes following standardised protocols , are now reported from additional countries ( Czech Republic , Cyprus , Austria , Poland , Slovenia , Slovakia ) .
This chapter presents an overview of the responses to drug problems in Europe , where possible highlighting trends , developments and quality issues .
Prevention measures are first reviewed followed by interventions in the areas of treatment , harm reduction and social reintegration .
Taken together , all these measures form a comprehensive drug demand reduction system .
They can be considered as complementary , and are sometimes provided in combination and by the same facilities .
This is , for example , increasingly the case for treatment and harm reduction measures .
The limited number of prevention programmes of proven effectiveness is being addressed in Europe by the EU @-@ Dap study ( www.eudap.net ) .
Involving 7 000 students aged 12 @-@ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evaluating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combines training in life @-@ skills with normative education and knowledge acquisition on substances .
The responses developed in the framework of drug law enforcement are also addressed in a new section which includes the most recent data on drug law offences .
The chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
Ideally , the different strategies do not compete but complement each other .
Gender @-@ dependent effects also came up in a Danish controlled trial on a life @-@ skills programme .
Girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bullying , past @-@ week and past @-@ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drinks on one occasion and having tried cannabis .
It aims to deter or delay the onset of drug use and drugrelated problems by providing young people with the information and skills necessary to avoid starting to use drugs .
Prevention measures undertaken in Europe are now , for the first time , being systematically monitored by the majority of Member States .
Selective and indicated prevention
New information on selective prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
Both selective and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( EMCDDA , 2008c ) .
Selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
The evidence base for this approach is presented in a new section of the EMCDDA 's Best practice portal ( 12 ) .
Indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavioural or psychological problems that may be predictive for developing problem substance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interventions .
Substance @-@ specific mass media campaigns
Similarly , the " Komet för föräldrar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing externalising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive peer relations .
Almost all these campaigns warn of the dangers of using the drug , and some of them use shock tactics .
Only two campaigns take a different approach .
The United Kingdom @-@ Colombian campaign " Shared responsibility " addresses the responsibility of users for the environmental and social harm associated with cocaine production .
The Dutch cannabis campaign in 2006 targeted normative beliefs with real @-@ life stories of young people as positive role models , instead of warnings and depiction of use .
Its evaluation found that negative social norms against cannabis smoking were reinforced and that there were no negative effects on intention to use and on normative beliefs ( Wammes et al . , 2007 ) .
Around 400 000 drug users are reported to have entered drug treatment in 2007 ( 14 ) .
This proportion has grown in recent years for various reasons , including the increased availability and diversification of specialised outpatient treatment .
Mass media campaigns highlighting the danger of drug use are only rarely evaluated for changes in behaviour , attitudes or intention to use drugs .
In addition , concerns have been expressed about their poor effectiveness and possible harm .
For example , a thorough evaluation of the outcome of the US national cannabis campaign revealed no overall effects .
There was , however , evidence that the campaign had unintended effects in favour of cannabis , and individuals who had previously been uninterested in the drug , reported an intention to use it ( Hornik et al . , 2008 ) .
Similar problems were reported in the evaluation of the Scottish cocaine campaign " Know the score " ( EMCDDA , 2007a ) .
Decision @-@ making by young people is a complex process , strongly influenced by peer group interactions and perception of social norms .
So far , mass media communication appears not to have responded effectively to this complexity .
Psychosocial interventions form the foundation of communitybased outpatient and inpatient treatment , and they also normally complement opioid substitution treatment . Drug detoxification is a
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe short @-@ term , medically supervised intervention aimed at resolving the withdrawal symptoms associated with chronic drug use .
It is generally provided in inpatient settings .
The relative size of the different treatment modalities in each country is influenced by several factors , including the organisation of the national health care system .
Outpatient psychosocial treatment is mostly provided by public institutions ( 16 countries ) or by nongovernmental organisations ( 10 countries ) .
According to national experts , this type of treatment is available to the majority of those who seek it in 10 countries , and available to nearly all of them in a further 13 countries .
In four countries ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Romania , Turkey ) , however , outpatient psychosocial treatment is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1A ) .
These ratings may hide considerable variation within countries and differences in the availability of specialised treatment programmes for cannabis or cocaine users .
Substitution treatment combined with psychosocial care is the predominant treatment option for opioid users in Europe .
It is generally provided as an outpatient treatment , though in some countries it is also available in inpatient settings .
For example , in Austria , 65 % of clients undergoing long @-@ term inpatient treatment are prescribed slow @-@ release morphine .
Substitution treatment is also increasingly provided in prisons ( 17 ) .
Drug users entering treatment in outpatient settings are predominantly young men , with an average age of 31 years and males almost four times as numerous as females ( 3.7 : 1 ) .
The age and sex profile of treatment clients varies with primary drug .
Cannabis clients are on average much younger ( 25 ) than opioid ( 32 ) and cocaine ( 33 ) clients .
Regardless of primary drug , the average age of clients entering treatment for the first time is about 2 years lower than that of all clients .
With the introduction of high @-@ dosage buprenorphine treatment in Cyprus in 2007 , opioid substitution treatment is now available in all EU Member States , as well as Croatia and Norway ( 18 ) .
In Turkey , substitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is permitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . In 16 countries , specialised public outpatient services are the main providers of substitution treatment .
See Tables HSR @-@ 1 and HSR @-@ 2 in the 2009 statistical bulletin.See Table HSR @-@ 3 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .

Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Treatment guidelines include recommendations based on scientific evidence , expert opinion , service user preferences and national health care systems .
They are designed to help choose and apply the appropriate drug treatment interventions .
In 20 out of 27 reporting countries , national drug treatment guidelines are drawn up by an authorised institution .
The mean age of drug users entering inpatient treatment is 30 years , but opioid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 28 ) and cannabis ( 26 ) .
Most inpatient clients are men , with an overall male to female ratio of 3.6 : 1 .
The ratio is lower among primary users of non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.1 : 1 ) and cannabis ( 8 : 1 ) .
Existing guidelines cover , in particular , pharmacological drug treatment .
National guidelines for substitution treatment are reported by 18 countries , and 11 countries report guidelines for detoxification .
However , about one third of these countries do not report adherence to the guidelines as a condition for operating or receiving funding for a treatment facility .
The main providers of inpatient treatment are nongovernmental organisations ( 12 countries ) and public institutions ( 11 countries ) .
National experts estimate that inpatient psychosocial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
However , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
National guidelines for psychosocial treatment and social reintegration are less common .
The scarcity of national guidelines is probably due to the limited evidence available , and this points to the need for more multisite randomised controlled trials in these fields .
Detoxification is generally a prerequisite to initiate long @-@ term , abstinence @-@ based residential treatment .
It is commonly , but not exclusively , an inpatient intervention provided in hospitals , specialist treatment centres or residential facilities with medical or psychiatric wards .
Most countries make similar training opportunities available to other professionals including nurses , social workers and psychologists .
Regular outcome evaluations for all types of drug treatment are reported by few countries .
Five Member States evaluate substitution and detoxification treatment , and only Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom evaluate the outcome of psychosocial treatment interventions on a regular basis .
Single or irregular treatment outcome evaluations are also reported by some countries .
Public institutions are the main providers of detoxification in 21 countries .
Nongovernmental organisations are the largest providers in Belgium ( Flanders ) and the Netherlands , while the private sector is predominant in Luxembourg and Bulgaria .
National experts estimate that detoxification is available to a majority of those who seek it in nine countries , and to almost all in a further 10 .
In eight countries ( Estonia , Ireland , Greece , France , Latvia , Romania , Slovenia , Norway ) , detoxification is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1D ) .
Quality assurance
Among the main interventions in this field are opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes ,
Health planners and policymakers in Europe increasingly look for mechanisms to ensure high quality in drug treatment .
They also tend to give priority to " evidencebased " interventions when considering the provision of treatment and the allocation of funds .
Best practice portal : new module on treatment
It includes a synthesis of findings about the efficacy of pharmacological and psychosocial treatment for opioid , stimulant and cannabis disorders , based on the latest reviews .
The treatment module presents the findings of studies that compare the efficacy of different interventions .
Efficacy is ideally determined by carrying out controlled trials or randomised controlled trials where interventions are compared against specific outcome measures . Most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common , and include some ground @-@ breaking work on new agents for opioid substitution treatment .
Responsibility for quality assurance lies with national institutions in 14 countries , while in countries with a federal system , agencies at sub @-@ national level can be in charge .
Guidance can be underpinned by research findings on cost @-@ effectiveness , as is the case in the United Kingdom 's guidance on needle and syringe programmes ( NICE , 2009 ) .
Client involvement and feedback by staff is also sought to develop and improve service quality .
The new module also includes : links to other information sources , evaluated interventions , a glossary and a brief synopsis of the gaps in the current evidence base .
The portal will be expanded to include additional topics in the future .
EMCDDA Best practice portal : http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / best @-@ practice which target overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases .
These measures are reported to be available in all countries except Turkey .
This figure is likely to be much higher for certain groups of drug users .
Most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , infectious diseases testing and counselling , vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis .
These services are often provided at lowthreshold agencies .
The focus of harm reduction responses has expanded beyond the HIV / AIDS epidemic into the broader perspective of catering for the health and social needs of problem drug users , especially those who are socially excluded .
All Member States report the availability of housing schemes that can accommodate drug users .
Information on the extent to which the housing needs of drug users are met , however , is scarce .
A process of professionalisation can also be observed in recent years , and more scrutiny is applied to assure high quality standards .
For example , in 2006 / 07 , harm reduction services in England were inspected in order to identify areas for improvement .
Quality may also be assured through stipulating adherence to specific standards in funding contracts , as reported by the Czech Republic and Estonia .
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
In Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their tenancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
This is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consensual crime , " where consenting individuals secretly participate in an unlawful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e.g. during a foot patrol ) or by active detection .
The value of this approach is supported by the results of a Scottish study , which found that recovering drug users who received employment @-@ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( McIntosh et al . , 2008 ) .
As a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
Controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at disrupting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
Performing checks and searches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more generic tactic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
Among the areas covered are drug use and possession , trafficking and production , as well as diversion of chemicals and money laundering .
Law enforcement institutions , especially customs , are also tasked in many countries with enforcing laws on controlled chemicals .
This involves processing importation and exportation requests as well as identifying and investigating suspicious transactions .

Use- and supply @-@ related offences
There has been no major shift in the balance between drug law offences related to use and those related to supply ( dealing , trafficking , production ) compared to previous years .
Offences related to supply are , however , predominant in the Czech Republic ( 87 % ) and the Netherlands ( 69 % ) ( Figure 2 ) .
In the 5 @-@ year period 2002 @-@ 07 , the number of drug law offences involving cannabis increased or remained stable in most reporting countries , resulting in an estimated increase of 23 % in the European Union .
Downward trends are reported by Bulgaria , the Czech Republic and Slovenia ( 32 ) .

Health and social responses in prison
The downward trend in heroin @-@ related offences in the European Union noted in previous reports now appears to have ceased , and an increase of about 7 % has been observed for the period 2002 @-@ 07 .
On a given day , there are over 600 000 people in prison in the European Union ( 36 ) , giving an average imprisonment rate of about 120 prisoners per 100 000 population .
National prison population rates range from 65 to 320 prisoners per 100 000 population with most Member States from central and eastern Europe reporting higher than average rates .
Nevertheless , the national figures , and the EU @-@ average , remain considerably below the rates reported from Russia ( 629 ) and the
The number of offences related to amphetamines reported in the European Union continues to show an upward trend , with an estimated increase of 59 % between 2002 and 2007 .

Injecting drug users in custody appear to share their equipment more often compared to users not in prison .
This raises issues around the potential spread of infectious diseases among the prison population .
According to expert ratings , however , there are differences in the provision of this intervention .
Prisoners are entitled to the same level of medical care as persons living in the community , and prison health services should be able to provide treatment for problems related to drug use in conditions comparable to those offered outside prison ( CPT , 2006 ; WHO , 2007 ) .

The provision of substitution treatment is also often dependent on local conditions , and sometimes relies on the initiative of the individual prison doctor .
Expert ratings of the availability and level of provision of other prevention and harm reduction measures in prison are available for 26 EU countries , Norway and Turkey .
Individual counselling on infectious diseases and assessment of drugrelated risk behaviour is reported to exist in prisons in 26 countries .
Other interventions include targeted prison hepatitis B
The provision of needle and syringe exchange in prison settings is reported by Germany , Spain , Luxembourg , Portugal and Romania , and it is planned in the United Kingdom ( Scotland ) .
Resistance from prison staff and lack of confidentiality have been reported as obstacles to the successful implementation of some needle and syringe exchange programmes in prison .

Introduction
Supply and availability
Cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world .
It is currently estimated that cannabis is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2009 ) ( 44 ) .
These facts taken together mean that it is difficult to produce accurate estimates of the worldwide production of cannabis .
The UNODC ( 2009 ) estimates global production of herbal cannabis in 2008 at between 13 300 tonnes and 66 100 tonnes .
Cannabis cultivation in Europe is widespread and possibly increasing ( Korf , 2008 ) .
In 2007 , 19 European countries mentioned domestic cannabis cultivation , though the scale of the phenomenon seems to vary considerably .
Herbal cannabis in Europe is also imported , mostly from Africa ( e.g. Nigeria , Morocco , Ghana , South Africa )
The use of cannabis in Europe has evolved considerably over the last decade , as has the debate on how to respond appropriately to the widespread use of this drug .
Moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @-@ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for cannabis related problems .
Europe may now be moving into a new phase , as data from general population and school surveys point to a stabilising or even decreasing situation .

The number of plants seized was 2.4 million , a figure that has been relatively stable over the past 2 years , up from about 1.5 million in 2002 .
Potency and price
Global production of cannabis resin in 2008 is estimated at between 2 200 tonnes and 9 900 tonnes ( UNODC , 2009 ) , with Morocco continuing to be the main producer .
The area under cannabis resin production is reported to have declined from 134 000 hectares to 76 400 hectares between 2003 and 2005 ( UNODC and Government of Morocco , 2007 ) .
Resin production is also reported in other countries , including Afghanistan and Pakistan ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
North America continued to account for the bulk of herbal cannabis seized ( 66 % ) , while quantities of resin seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 66 % ) ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
Systematic and routine information to describe illicit drug markets and trafficking is still limited .
The amount of herbal cannabis seized halved during the first 2 years of this period thereafter increasing , though remaining well below the 130 tonnes seized in 2002 .
The highest number of seizures of herbal cannabis was reported by the United Kingdom , accounting for approximately half of the total in 2005 and 2006 .
Drug seizures are often considered as an indirect indicator of the supply , trafficking routes and availability of drugs .
They are a more direct indicator of drug law enforcement activities ( e.g. priorities , resources , strategies ) , while also reflecting both reporting practices and the vulnerability of traffickers .
Seizures of cannabis resin in Europe exceed herbal cannabis seizures , both in number and amount seized (
Between 2002 and 2007 , the number of cannabis resin seizures increased , though the amount seized fluctuated over the same period .
) The data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 to SZR @-@ 6 in the 2009 statistical bulletin . )
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe include those using the drug more regularly , though not necessarily in an intensive way .
It is estimated that about 12 million Europeans used the drug in the last month , on average about 3.6 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .
Population surveys : an important tool for understanding drug use patterns and trends in Europe
Drug use in the general or school population can be measured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the proportion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
Surveys also provide useful contextual information on patterns of use , sociodemographic characteristics of users and perceptions of risks and availability .
The extent to which the samples analysed reflect the overall market is unclear and , for this reason , data on potency should be interpreted with caution .
In 2007 , the reported national mean THC content of cannabis resin ranged from 2.9 % to 13.3 % .
The mean potency of herbal cannabis , excluding home @-@ grown sinsemilla ( " nederwiet " ) in the Netherlands , ranged from 1.2 % to 10.2 % .
However , upward trends in the mean THC content of cannabis resin were registered in Portugal and Luxembourg .
Information on the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean potency of nederwiet was observed , from a peak of 20.3 % in 2004 to 16.0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .
The EMCDDA , in close collaboration with national experts , has developed a set of core items for use in adult surveys ( the " European Model Questionnaire , " EMQ ) .
Surveys are expensive to conduct and few European countries collect information each year , although many collect it at intervals of two to four years .
In this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .
The mean retail price of cannabis resin , in 2007 , ranged from EUR 3 to EUR 11 per gram in the 18 countries providing information , with half of them reporting values between EUR 5 and EUR 9 .
The mean retail price of herbal cannabis ranged between EUR 1 and EUR 12 per gram in the 17 countries supplying information , with about half of them reporting prices of between EUR 4 and EUR 9 .
The European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs ( ESPAD ) uses standardised methods and instruments to measure drug and alcohol use among representative samples of 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students .
Surveys have been conducted in 1995 , 1999 , 2003 and 2007 .
Considerable differences exist between countries , with national prevalence figures varying from 1.5 % to 38.6 % .
For most of the countries , the prevalence estimates are in the range 10 @-@ 30 % .
It is estimated that around 22.5 million Europeans have used cannabis in the last year , or on average 6.8 % of all 15- to 64 @-@ year @-@ olds .

European prevalence estimates are based on weighted averages from the most recent national surveys conducted from 2001 to 2008 ( mainly 2004 @-@ 08 ) , therefore they cannot be attached to a single year .
The average prevalence for Europe was computed by a weighted average according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
In countries for which no information was available , the average EU prevalence was imputed .
Populations used as basis : 15 @-@ 64 ( 334 million ) , 15 @-@ 34 ( 133 million ) and 15 @-@ 24 ( 63 million ) .
The data summarised here are available under " General population surveys " in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
Cannabis use among young adults olds . This is the case in almost all European countries , with the exception of Portugal ( 48
Cannabis use is largely concentrated among young people ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) , with the highest levels of last year use generally being reported among the 15- to 24 @-@ year-
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years , recalculated by the EMCDDA ) and a last year prevalence of 21 % .
For the same age group , lifetime prevalence of cannabis use was 58 % and last year prevalence 28 % in Canada ( 2004 ) , while in Australia ( 2007 ) the figures were 47 % and 16 % .
All these figures are above the corresponding European averages , which are respectively 31.1 % and 12.5 % .
National prevalence estimates of cannabis use vary widely between countries in all measures of prevalence , with countries at the upper end of the scale reporting values up to 10 times those of the lowest @-@ prevalence countries .
Cannabis use is generally higher among males than among females ( see EMCDDA , 2006a ) , though marked differences between countries are observed .
For example , the ratio of males to females among those reporting use of cannabis in the last year ranged from 6.4 : 1 in Portugal to 1.4 : 1 in Austria .
In 2007 , the survey was conducted in 25 EU Member States as well as Norway and Croatia .
National survey data reported to the EMCDDA show that in almost all EU countries cannabis use increased markedly during the 1990s , in particular among young people ( Figure 3 ) and school students .
Corresponding levels of last year prevalence among this age group were as high as 15 @-@ 20 % in seven countries and last month prevalence reached 8 @-@ 15 % in six countries .
Lifetime prevalence levels of cannabis use of between 13 % and 25 % are reported by 15 countries .
The highest last month prevalence of cannabis use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Europe is reported by Spain ( 20 % )
For instance , in the United States , the National survey on drug use and health ( Samhsa , 2007 ) estimated a lifetime prevalence of cannabis use of 49 %
The trend in cannabis use in the United Kingdom is particularly interesting .
In the early and mid @-@ 1990s , this country stood out in the European picture as the one reporting the highest prevalence estimates .
This picture has progressively changed , as levels of use rose in other countries .
Moreover , cannabis use in the United Kingdom has been steadily declining since around 2003 , particularly among the 16 @-@ 24 age group ( 52 ) , suggesting a generational shift .
A downward or stabilising trend can now be seen elsewhere , in both school and some general population survey data .
In three countries , prevalence levels have increased by at least 15 % , although other data put this upward trend into question .

As with adults , increases in cannabis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
Only two of the countries monitored by the EMCDDA that participated in ESPAD school surveys in 2007 ( Lithuania , Slovakia ) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lifetime cannabis use since 2003 , while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period ( 54 ) .
Available data point to a variety of patterns of cannabis use .
Figure 4 : Different patterns in trends in lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students
Other studies suggested that cannabis dependence can be relatively stable over time ( Swift et al . , 2000 ) . Nevertheless , probably over half of
The European averages are an estimation based on a weighted average ( for the population ) for countries with information , and imputed for countries without information .
The figures obtained are 1.2 % for all adults ( 15 @-@ 64 years ) and 2.3 % for young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) .
See Table
Chapter 3 : Cannabis dependent cannabis users who stop using the drug are able to do so without treatment ( Cunningham , 2000 ; Ellingstad et al . , 2006 ) .
Patterns among school students
The 2007 ESPAD surveys also show that lifetime cannabis use is correlated with perceptions of lower risk and higher availability of the drug ( 62
Compared with the general population of students , cannabis users are more likely to use alcohol , tobacco and other illicit drugs ( 63
The EMCDDA is therefore developing , in collaboration with several countries , methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long @-@ term forms of cannabis use .
Different methodologies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the prevalence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly cannabis use , have been tested in recent years .
Clients entering outpatient centres because of cannabis use often also report the use of other drugs .
Additional validation studies , which are currently in progress or planned , might help overcome these difficulties .

Cannabis users entering outpatient treatment in Europe are mainly young males , with a male to female ratio of
5.5 : 1 and a mean age of 25 years ( 67
Among drug users entering outpatient treatment for the first time , primary cannabis use is reported by 67 % of those aged 15 @-@ 19 years ( 68
) and by 78 % of those younger than 15 years .
may also reduce the risk of young people mixing with more problematic and older drug users .
In 2008 , the EMCDDA collected information on the availability of such programmes in Europe .
National experts reported that they existed in 13 out of 25 reporting countries ( Figure 5 ) .
Availability of services varied between countries .
It was estimated that : nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France , Greece and Slovenia ; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom ; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries .
Among the 12 countries reporting that specific programmes for cannabis users do not exist , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Cyprus , Romania and Turkey are planning to set them up during the next 3 years .

Considerable differences are observed between countries .
In Hungary , Romania and Croatia , the majority of cannabis clients are occasional users , while in Belgium , Denmark , Spain , France , Malta and the Netherlands the majority are daily users ( 69 ) .
A French study , among clients of specialised counselling centres , found that 63 % of daily cannabis users were dependent ( Obradovic , 2008 ) .

Internet @-@ based treatment
Internet @-@ based drug treatment has existed in the European Union since 2004 and its provision is still limited .
A recent study provides insights into the current state of development of this type of intervention in the European Union ( EMCDDA , 2009a ) .
Internet @-@ based treatment can be defined as " specifically elaborated or adapted , structured and scheduled drug treatment interventions , offered in and communicated over the World Wide Web . "
FRED ( see Chapter 2 ) offers motivational interviewing @-@ based counselling for those referred by the criminal justice system .
Internet @-@ based treatment is developed by organisations in the treatment or prevention fields and aims at helping users to assess their substance use and to assist them in their attempts to change this behaviour .
Interventions provide information and knowledge tests or games about drugs and drug dependence , or drug consumption self @-@ tests .
The latter can be implemented via one @-@ to @-@ one chats or message boards .
Contact with other users via a forum is also sometimes provided , thereby creating virtual self @-@ help groups .
The scientific literature suggests that a number of psychotherapies , such as motivational and cognitivebehavioural therapies , are effective for cannabis treatment but that none has been found to be more effective than the others ( Nordstrom and Levin , 2007 ) .
Some problem cannabis users may also benefit from brief interventions , delivered for example by social services for juveniles , general practitioners and schools .
Preliminary evaluation results of the " Quit the shit " intervention for cannabis users in Germany has shown that 32 % of participants reported abstinence after completing the programme and that first @-@ time treatment seekers , in particular , were reached .
( MDMA ) , but other analogues are also sometimes found in ecstasy tablets ( MDA , MDEA ) .
Moreover , in some countries , use of amphetamines constitutes an important part of the drug problem , accounting for a substantial proportion of those in need of treatment .
The most widely known synthetic hallucinogenic drug in Europe is lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , consumption of which has been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time .
In recent years , there appears to have been a growing interest among young people in naturally occurring hallucinogens such as those found in hallucinogenic mushrooms .

America ( 72 ) . Global seizures of amphetamines in 2007
Most amphetamine seized in Europe is produced , in order of importance , in the Netherlands , Poland and Belgium , and to a lesser extent in Estonia and Lithuania .
In 2007 , 29 sites involved in the production , tableting or storage of amphetamines were discovered in the European Union and reported to Europol .
In 2007 , an estimated 40 000 seizures amounting to 8.1
Category 2 contains important reagents such as potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride , which are widely used to manufacture cocaine and heroin , respectively .
See " What is a drug precursor ? "
72 ) For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability , see p .
Between 2005 and 2007 , both the number and the quantity of methamphetamine seized in Europe have been increasing , though both remain low in comparison to other drugs .
Over the past 5 years , the purity of amphetamine has been stable or falling in most of those 20 countries where sufficient data are available to allow analysis of trends .
Of the 11 countries where a comparison of data for 2007 and 2006 was possible , Spain , France and Austria reported increases in the retail price , while the rest reported stable or decreasing prices .
Global ecstasy seizures in 2007 reached 7.9 tonnes , with increases reported in most regions .
West and central Europe accounted for 36 % of the global seizures , and southeast Europe for 2 % ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
Overall , more than 24 000 seizures , resulting in the interception of an estimated 13 million ecstasy tablets were reported in Europe in 2007 .
The Netherlands reported the largest quantity seized , which at 8.4 million tablets represents a doubling of the quantity reported in 2006 .
Only two other European countries reported seizures approaching this magnitude in 2007 , with France and Germany both reporting about one million tablets seized .
The United Kingdom also reported seizing over 6 million tablets in 2006 , but data for 2007 are not yet available .
Over the period 2002 @-@ 07 , the number of ecstasy seizures reported in Europe dropped sharply in 2003 , but has since shown a slight increase year on year .
Over the same period , the quantity seized declined to a low in 2005 , but has increased again , and appears to be approaching the 2002 level .
In 2007 , almost 4 500 seizures of methamphetamine , amounting to approximately 340 kg of the drug , were reported in Europe .
Methamphetamine production in Europe : EMCDDA @-@ Europol joint publication
In 2009 , the EMCDDA and Europol launched a series of joint publications on the supply of drugs in Europe .
In Luxembourg , most tablets ( 83 % ) analysed contained no controlled substance , as was the case in Cyprus ( 53 % ) .
Reports on the supply of other synthetic drugs in Europe , including amphetamine and ecstasy , will be added to the series at a later stage .

The typical MDMA content of ecstasy tablets tested in 2007 was between 19 and 75 mg in the 11 countries providing data .
In addition , high @-@ dose ecstasy tablets containing over 130 mg of MDMA were reported by

Relatively high levels of amphetamines or ecstasy use among the general population are reported by some EU Member States ( Czech Republic , Estonia , United Kingdom ) .
In a few countries , the use , often by injection , of amphetamine or methamphetamine accounts for a substantial proportion of the overall number of problem drug users and those seeking help for drug problems .
Finally , the overall consumption levels of hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) and hallucinogenic mushrooms are generally low and have been largely stable in recent years .
There are no clear trends in the purity of ecstasy tablets .
Ecstasy is now considerably cheaper than it was in the 1990s , when it first became widely available .
The data available for 2002 @-@ 07 suggest that the retail price , adjusted for inflation , has continued to fall .
Hallucinogenic substances
On average , it is estimated that 3.5 % of all European adults have used amphetamines at least once .
Last year use of the drug is much lower , with a European average of 0.5 % . These estimates suggest that around 12 million Europeans have tried amphetamines , and about 2 million have used the drug during the last year ( see Table 5 for a summary of the data ) .
LSD use and trafficking in Europe is still considered marginal .
The data available indicate a decline in quantities seized over the period 2002 @-@ 07 , while the number of seizures increased slightly between 2003 and 2007 .
LSD retail prices ( adjusted for inflation ) have been slightly declining since 2003 , and in 2007 the mean value ranged between EUR 5 and EUR 12 per unit for the majority of reporting countries .
Last year use of amphetamines in this age group ranges from 0.1 % to 3.1 % , with the majority of countries reporting prevalence estimates of between 0.5 % and 2.0 % .
It is estimated that , on average , 1.1 % of young Europeans have used amphetamines during the last year .
76 ) Survey data on " amphetamine use " often do not distinguish between amphetamine and methamphetamine , though , as use of methamphetamine is uncommon in Europe , prevalence should typically reflect the use of amphetamine ( sulphate or dexamphetamine ) .77 ) Data from all ESPAD countries and Spain .

Amphetamine users in treatment frequently report the use of other drugs , mainly cannabis and alcohol , and
In those countries where primary sometimes opioids ( amphetamine users make up a high proportion of those entering treatment , injection is the most frequently reported method of use ( 63 @-@ 83 % ) .
Last year use of the drug varies across Europe , from 0.1 % to 3.5 % .
On all measures , and as with most other illicit drugs , reported use is far higher among males than among females .
In contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited .
Historically , use of this drug in Europe has been concentrated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
In both of these countries , methamphetamine is reported as the primary drug by a large proportion of clients entering treatment : 61 % in the Czech Republic and 26 % in Slovakia .
Between 2002 and 2007 , the demand for treatment related to methamphetamine use has been increasing in both countries ( 82 ) .
Among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students , lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use ranges from 1 % to 5 % in most of the 28 countries surveyed in 2007 .
Only four countries report higher prevalence levels : Bulgaria , Estonia , Slovakia ( all 6 % ) and Latvia ( 7 % ) .
Injection is the most commonly reported means of administration reported by methamphetamine users in treatment ( 82 % in Czech Republic , 41 % in Slovakia ) .
Use of other drugs is also often reported , mainly cannabis , alcohol and opioids .
In Slovakia , a sharp increase has been noted in the number of recipients of opioid substitution treatment reporting the use of methamphetamine .
The number of primary ecstasy users entering treatment in 2007 remained trivial .
In two thirds of the countries , ecstasy is mentioned by less than 1 % of drug clients ; elsewhere , the proportion varies between 1 % and 5 % .
With an average age of 24 years , ecstasy clients are among the youngest groups entering drug treatment and often report the concomitant use of other substances , including cannabis , cocaine , alcohol and amphetamines ( 84 ) .
Lifetime prevalence of LSD use among the adult population ( 15 @-@ 64 years ) ranges from almost zero to 5.2 % .

reports , are supported by the most recent data .
Cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy in some countries and among some sectors of the drug @-@ using population .
In Denmark , amphetamine use increased from 0.5 % in 1994 to 3.1 % in 2000 , with a similar figure in 2008 ( 87 ) .
ESPAD and other school surveys conducted in 2007 suggest , overall , little change in the levels of experimentation with amphetamine and ecstasy among students aged 15 to 16 years .
Considering differences of at least two percentage points between 2003 and 2007 , lifetime prevalence of amphetamine use increased in nine countries .
By the same measure , ecstasy use increased in seven countries .
A decrease in lifetime prevalence of amphetamine use was observed only in Estonia , while Czech Republic , Portugal , Croatia reported a decrease in ecstasy use .
For ecstasy use among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 ) , the picture is more mixed .

using amphetamines and ecstasy or other drugs such as ketamine and GHB .
Estimates of drug use in these settings are typically high , but are not generalisable to the wider population , and much of the drug use tends to occur on weekends and during holiday periods ( EMCDDA , 2006b ) .
Users of amphetamines generally receive treatment in outpatient drug services which , in countries with histories of significant levels of the use of amphetamines , can be specialised in treating this type of drug problem .
Treatment for the most problematic users of amphetamines may be provided in inpatient drug services or in psychiatric clinics or hospitals .
Prevalence data from studies conducted in recreational settings in 2007 are available from five countries ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Latvia , Lithuania , Austria ) .
Lifetime prevalence estimates ranged from 15 % to 71 % for ecstasy use and from 17 % to 68 % for amphetamines .
Four of these studies also reported lifetime prevalence estimates for hallucinogenic mushrooms , ranging from 4 % to 64 % .
Frequent use of ecstasy or amphetamines can also be found in these settings but it is generally much lower .
An indication of the extent to which the use of these drugs may be concentrated among the young , club @-@ going population can be gleaned from the 2007 / 08 British Crime Survey .
Specific treatment programmes for problem amphetamines users are reported in nine countries ( Germany , Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia , United Kingdom ) .
The availability of these programmes varies between countries .
Only three of these countries ( Portugal , Slovenia , United Kingdom ) report that specialised programmes are available to the majority of amphetamines users who actively seek treatment .
In the other six countries , national experts estimate that specialised amphetamines treatment is available to less than half of the users seeking it .
The content of these specific programmes for users of these drugs is often not well documented .
The health and safety of people who attend nightclubs and use drugs is a growing public health concern .
Guidelines , such as the " Safer dancing " guidelines developed in the United Kingdom , have become an important tool in this field .
However , while 12 countries now report having developed such guidelines for nightlife venues , only the Netherlands , Slovenia , Sweden and the United Kingdom report that they are monitored and enforced .
Promising results have been reported for recent investigations on pharmacological agents to manage abstinence or reduce the cravings associated with amphetamines dependence , which up to now have been lacking .
Dexamphetamine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amphetamines in England and Wales , where it may be prescribed by any doctor . However , information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited .
However , this approach is rarely used in Europe , though there have been some pilot projects ( see Chapter 5 ) .
all from doctors working in the National Health Service ( NHS ) .
A survey of 265 NHS specialist services , carried out in 2000 , revealed that dexamphetamine prescribing was available in about one third of the services surveyed ( Rosenberg et al . , 2002 ) .
However , the United Kingdom guidelines on clinical management of drug dependence recommend against substitute prescribing of dexamphetamine , due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness ( NTA , 2007 ) .
As yet , no one psychosocial intervention has shown strong evidence of effectiveness in helping psychostimulant users to maintain abstinence .
In the literature , the interventions that have demonstrated the most efficacy in treating users of stimulant drugs are cognitive behavioural approaches such as relapse prevention .
The effectiveness of other types of intervention is not well supported .
The literature is particularly hindered by the paucity of wellconducted studies among primary amphetamine users , especially treatment outcome studies ( Baker et al . , 2004 ) .
Further research into psychosocial and pharmacological treatment for those with problems related to the use of amphetamines , especially injectors , is needed .
Current treatment practices and treatment coverage in Europe also needs to be better documented , and much remains to be done in the sharing of best practice .
The lack of dedicated programmes might be failing to encourage amphetamine or methamphetamine users to seek treatment , especially at early stages of use .
Such measures may be particularly useful in those countries that have recently seen a growth in the numbers of problem amphetamine and methamphetamine users , especially injectors ( Talu et al . , 2009 ) .
Introduction profiles among cocaine users , assessing the prevalence of the drug 's use , its health and social consequences and the necessary responses presents a unique set of challenges .
The data available also indicate considerable diversity among cocaine users , both in terms of patterns of use and in terms of sociodemographics .
Those who only experiment with the substance on one or a few occasions make up the largest group .
Another group includes socially integrated regular users who , in some countries , account for a relatively large number of young people .
Some of them will intensify their use of cocaine , or use it over a long period , which may lead to chronic health and social problems and to the need for treatment .
Most of the process to convert coca leaves into cocaine hydrochloride remains located in Colombia , Peru and

Laws to counter drug trafficking in the high seas
Success in disrupting drug trafficking at sea relies on cooperation between states , and this is facilitated by two international conventions .
Bolivia , although it may also occur in other South American countries .
Colombia 's importance in the production of cocaine is corroborated by information on laboratories dismantled and seizures of potassium permanganate , a chemical reagent used in the synthesis of cocaine hydrochloride .
In 2007 , 2 471 cocaine laboratories were dismantled ( 78 % of the world total ) and a total of 144 tonnes of potassium permanganate was seized in Colombia ( 94 % of global seizures ) ( INCB , 2009a ) .
Competent national authorities are nominated to act as contact points , permanently on @-@ call , in order to reply to such requests as soon as possible .
Requests may be granted , granted with conditions or refused .
The available information suggests that cocaine continues to be trafficked to Europe via different routes ( EMCDDA , 2008d ) .
Cocaine consignments transit through South and Central American countries , such as Argentina , Brazil , Ecuador , Mexico and Venezuela , before reaching Europe .
Caribbean countries are also frequently used in the transhipment of the drug to Europe .
On these routes , cocaine is smuggled through commercial flights or by sea .
In recent years , an alternative route through West Africa has been identified .
From there , cocaine is often transported to Europe by fishing and sailing vessels , though trafficking by air or overland through north Africa has also been reported ( Europol , 2007 ) .
Other transiting countries have also been mentioned in recent years .
Belgium , Spain , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Portugal and the United Kingdom have been mentioned as important transit countries for cocaine shipments inside Europe .
Seizures quantity of cocaine seized and the highest number of seizures of the drug - about half of the total - in Europe .
Cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after herbal cannabis and cannabis resin .
In 2007 , global seizures of cocaine remained stable at about 710 tonnes .
In Europe , the number of cocaine seizures has been on the increase for the last 20 years , and more notably since 2003 .
In 2007 , the number of cocaine seizures increased to 92 000 cases , though the total quantity recovered dropped to 77 tonnes , down from 121 tonnes in 2006 .
The fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal , and to a lesser extent Spain and France , reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year ( 90 ) .
For those countries reporting sufficient data to make a comparison , cocaine sold on the street became cheaper between 2002 and 2007 .
These estimates are likely to be conservative .
In countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
This counter @-@ intuitive finding could be explained by several factors .
An increase in the supply of cocaine to Europe , reflected in rising volumes of seizures , is certainly a key factor here .
The search for an alternative to the United States " market , by South American cocaine traffickers , may be a " push " factor driving the increased targeting of the European market .
Additionally , a " pull " factor may have been the growing demand for cocaine in Europe .
The increased volume of European cocaine consumption together with the relative strength of European currencies compared to the US dollar could have compensated for declining prices and , possibly , smaller profit margins .
Only a small proportion of those who have used cocaine at least once in their life appear to develop intensive patterns of use .
Data from general population surveys suggest high discontinuation rates among cocaine users .
Other factors , however , might also have influenced the price of cocaine .
More competition inside the cocaine market ( Desroches , 2007 ) might also have influenced the drug 's price in Europe .
The lack of data in this area makes this analysis necessarily speculative and underlines the importance of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that influence Europe 's drug market .
The EMCDDA is committed to continue developing collaborations and research in this area .
The European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.8 % ( 1 million ) .
Cocaine use among the general population
Overall , cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe , after cannabis , though levels of use vary greatly between countries .
It is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime , on average 3.9 % of adults aged 15 @-@ 64 years ( see Table 8 for a summary of the data ) .
National figures vary from 0.1 % to 8.3 % , with 12 out of 23 countries , including most central and eastern European countries , reporting low levels of lifetime prevalence among all adults ( 0.5 @-@ 2 % ) .
Cocaine use is also associated with alcohol use and certain lifestyles .
For purity and price data , see Tables PPP @-@ 3 and PPP @-@ 7 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .

Visiting nightclubs was also associated with increased cocaine use , as nearly 10 % of the 16- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds who visited a club on four or more occasions during the last month report last year use of cocaine , compared with 3.3 % among those who had not visited a club .
Lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students in the ESPAD survey is between 1 % and 2 % in half of the 28 reporting countries .
International comparisons
The 2008 Eurobarometer survey , which was conducted in the 27 EU Member States , shows that 85 % of 15- to 25 @-@ year @-@ olds perceive cocaine use as a high risk to a person 's health .
The proportions of respondents perceiving a similar level of health risk from using other substances are much lower : 40 % for cannabis , 28 % for tobacco and 24 % for alcohol .
Only heroin use is perceived as a high risk by a greater proportion of respondents .
There is little variation between countries , and 95 % of the respondents considered that cocaine should continue to be banned ( European Commission , 2008b ) .
Estimates of the prevalence of cocaine use among school students are much lower than those for cannabis use .

Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Among those entering treatment for the first time , the proportion reporting cocaine as their primary drug is higher ( 22 % ) .
Network ( DAWN ) estimated that cocaine , alone or in combination with other drugs , was involved in six out of every 10 drugrelated emergency visits in 2006 .
Spain reports the highest proportions among all clients ( 45 % ) and new clients ( 60 % ) , followed by the Netherlands ( 32 % and 29 % ) and Italy ( 23 % and 26 % ) .
The concomitant use of opioids and cocaine appears to be linked to a higher risk of opioid overdose ( EMCDDA , 2007a ) .
Dependence is one of the negative consequences of cocaine use for the individual .
Another study showed that , among those who become dependent , close to 40 % recover without drug or alcohol treatment ( Cunningham , 2000 ) .
Problem cocaine use and treatment demand

Cocaine clients have one of the largest male to female ratios ( five men for every woman ) and one of the highest mean ages ( around 32 years ) among drug treatment clients .

are available for the United Kingdom . In Italy , in 2007 , there were estimated to be between 3.8 and 4.7 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
Chapter 5 : Cocaine and crack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
Crack cocaine use in Europe
Cocaine is available in two forms in Europe : as cocaine powder ( cocaine HCI , a hydrochloride salt ) and the less commonly used crack cocaine ( a free base ) .
Crack is typically smoked , and is known for inducing an intense " high " that may lead to problematic patterns of use .
In general , it is manufactured from cocaine HCl in locations close to where it is retailed and used .
In 2007 , around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered outpatient treatment for primary use of crack cocaine , representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in outpatient treatment .
Almost one quarter ( 22 % ) of primary crack clients also use heroin , and these clients report high levels of unemployment and homelessness ( 104 ) .
The use of crack started to spread in the United States in the mid @-@ 1980s , mainly in deprived inner city sections of metropolitan areas , disproportionately affecting ethnic minorities .
It has been feared that a similar phenomenon could happen in Europe but , until now , a serious crack epidemic has not been observed .
Crack cocaine is , however , used in some European cities , although it is difficult to know the exact size of the phenomenon .
Reports on the situation in London ( GLADA , 2004 ) and Dublin ( Connolly et al . , 2008 ) also suggest that increases can take place .
The first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . Some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
It includes former heroin users re @-@ entering drug treatment for cocaine use .
Sizable crack problems have also been reported by cities in other European countries .
Among socially integrated individuals , including regular powder cocaine users , crack use is very unusual ( Prinzleve et al . , 2004 ) .
Nevertheless , the persistence of crack use in some groups and cities underlines the risk of its spread to larger populations .
Some countries ( e.g. Ireland , Italy , Spain ) , however , have implemented strategies or treatment programmes targeting cocaine users , and France is in the process of developing such programmes .
Almost half the cocaine clients start using the drug before the age of 20 , and 88 % before the age of 30 .
Netherlands (
Most cocaine clients snort ( 55 % ) or smoke ( 32 % ) the drug and less than 7 % report injecting it ( 102
For this reason , in Ireland outreach work and other interventions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Connolly et al . , 2008 ) .
Outreach treatment programmes can also be beneficial for certain groups .
Among them , 42 % also use alcohol , 28 % cannabis and 16 % heroin . Cocaine is also often mentioned as a secondary drug ,
( 101 ) See Tables TDI @-@ 10 , TDI @-@ 11 ( part iii ) , TDI @-@ 21 and TDI @-@ 103 ( part ii ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . ( 102 ) See Table TDI @-@ 17 ( part iv ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
See " Crack cocaine use in Europe , " and Tables TDI @-@ 7 and TDI @-@ 115 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
Germany , Ireland , Austria , the Netherlands , France and Spain estimated that they were available only to a minority of them .
For example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where opioid users are the main clientele . Measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
A similar approach is also reported in Ireland , where specific programmes are developed to attract powder cocaine users .
In the United Kingdom , a clinical trial is investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in conjunction with contingency management ( see EMCDDA , 2008b ) in primary cocaine users .
According to a recent Cochrane review , this combination has yielded the best results for the treatment of stimulant dependence ( Knapp et al . , 2007 ) .
Modafinil has already shown therapeutic potential in several trials as a substitute agent for stimulant dependence .
Thus , maintaining regular attendance at therapy sessions and meaningful therapeutic dialogue is reported as difficult by professionals ( Connolly et al . , 2008 ) .
Use of cocaine can also disrupt treatment for dependence on other drugs and jeopardise successfully achieved abstinence from heroin .
In Germany for example , concomitant cocaine use has been identified as a decisive factor in those dropping out of opioid substitution treatment .
It is the largest trial conducted on this vaccine to date , with several hundred volunteers participating .
These difficulties can be tackled by the development of specific treatment programmes and training courses adapted to the problems associated with cocaine and crack use .
Cocaine @-@ specific training for treatment staff is reported from Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom .
In addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
Programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
However , large seizures of opium and morphine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CND , 2008 ; UNODC , 2009 ) .
Heroin use , particularly injecting the drug , has been closely associated with problem drug use in Europe since the 1970s .
Today , this drug still accounts for the greatest share of morbidity and mortality related to drug use in the European Union .
A decline in heroin use and associated problems has been observed in the last 10 years , though more recent data suggest that , in some countries , the trend may have changed direction .
Table 9 : Production , seizure , price and purity of heroin
Price and purity in Europe
Mean purity ( % ) Range ( Interquartile range ) (
Heroin consumed in Europe originates predominantly in Afghanistan , which accounts for most of the global illicit opium output .
Global opium production is estimated to have decreased from a peak in 2007 , mainly due to a decrease in Afghan production from 8 890 tonnes to some 8 000 tonnes in 2008 .
The most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 735 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
) For information on the sources of data for drug supply and availability , see p . 39 .
Heroin prices at different levels of the market
Heroin from south @-@ west Asia is also smuggled directly to Europe ( United Kingdom ) by air from Pakistan .
Within the European Union , the Netherlands and , to a lesser extent , Belgium play an important role as secondary distribution hubs ( Europol , 2008 ) .
Worldwide reported seizures of opium increased markedly in 2007 to 510 tonnes , with Iran accounting for 84 % of the total .
Global reported seizures of morphine decreased sharply to 27 tonnes , while global heroin seizures increased slightly to 65 tonnes .
The largest seizures of heroin were reported by Iran ( 25 % of the world total ) , followed by Turkey and Afghanistan ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
Among these countries , the reported wholesale price of heroin ranges from EUR 12.5 to EUR 35.8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ranges from EUR 36 to EUR 62.7 .
At both wholesale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
The ratio between retail and wholesale price also varies considerably , from 1.6 : 1 in the Czech Republic to 2.8 : 1 in the United Kingdom .
Possible differences in drug purity , either between countries , market levels or over time , necessitate caution when making comparisons .
Nonetheless , analysis in this area can be informative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
In Europe , an estimated 58 000 seizures resulted in the interception of 22 tonnes of heroin in 2007 .
The United Kingdom continued to report the highest number of seizures , while Turkey again reported the greatest quantity seized , with 13.2 tonnes recovered in 2007 ( 106 ) .
The overall trend in the quantity of heroin intercepted in Turkey differs from that observed in the European Union .
Purity and price
It is worth noting that many countries report that most " problem opioid users " could be described as polydrug users who also use opioids .
Note that where data for 2007 is absent , the corresponding data for 2006 are used to estimate European totals .
This analysis is preliminary as data for the United Kingdom are not yet available for 2007 . )
See Tables PPP @-@ 2 and PPP @-@ 6 in the 2009 statistical bulletin for purity and price data .
Chapter 6 : Opioid use and drug injection
0 Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002 @-@ 07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000 .
NB : The symbol indicates a point estimate ; a bar indicates an estimation uncertainty interval : a 95 % confidence interval , or one based on sensitivity analysis .
Target groups may vary slightly , owing to different estimation methods and data sources ; therefore , comparisons should be made with caution .
Nonstandard age ranges were used in the studies from Finland ( 15 @-@ 54 ) , Malta ( 12 @-@ 64 ) and Poland ( all ages ) .
All three rates were adjusted to the population aged 15 @-@ 64 , assuming that drug use in other age groups will be negligible .
For Germany and Cyprus , the interval represents the highest and lowest bounds of all existing estimates , and the point estimate a simple average of the midpoints .
Methods of estimation are abbreviated : CR = capture @-@ recapture ; TM = treatment multiplier ; MI = multivariate indicator ; MM = mortality multiplier ; CM = combined methods ; OT = other methods .
Overall , of the around 325 000 treatment entries for which the primary drug is known , 49 % cited heroin as their primary drug ; if other opioids are included , time ( 112 ) .
The percentage of primary opioid users among this figure rises to 55 % of these clients ( 110
1 11 those clients who were in treatment for more than 1 year was reported to be over 50 % in all countries participating in the study .
Clients entering treatment for primary opioid use often report the use of other drugs .
Many opioid users are enrolled in programmes providing long @-@ term care .
This is reflected in a higher proportion of primary opioid users among drug users already in treatment .
A recent analysis of data on clients in drug treatment in 14 countries found that primary opioid users and alcohol ( 7 % ) ( 113 ) .
) This estimate has been adjusted from 1.5 to 1.4 million on the basis of new data .

Incidence of problem opioid use
It has also launched , in collaboration with the University of Zurich , a study to test a new " one @-@ day " method using the distribution of " latency time " ( time to treatment ) in a cross @-@ sectional sample of treated heroin users .
In at least five regions , the incidence estimates allowed the derivation of prevalence estimates that were in a good accordance with other existing estimates ( e.g. by the capture @-@ recapture method ) .
Similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seizures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . In the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @-@ related cases may also be observed .
Future work might include studies in other EU countries , analyses of spatial differences and by gender and routes of administration .
This is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seizures and druginduced deaths , and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use .
Injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
Only 12 countries were able to provide recent estimates of the levels of injecting drug
In Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem opioid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 114 ) . Information from the
Chapter 6 : Opioid use and drug injection
EMCDDA " Selected issue " on injecting drug use
Another indicator of more recent initiation into injecting is the proportion of young injectors ( under age 25 ) found in samples .
Injecting drug use is one of the main determinants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hepatitis C and overdose .
The " Selected issue " focuses on the situation and trends of injecting drug use and on specific interventions that target injecting drug users in Europe .
The publication also discusses the possible mechanisms behind decreases of drug injecting observed in some countries or regions , and why levels may still be high ( or increasing ) in other regions .
It also discusses interventions and policies that aim to reduce injecting and those that may promote users to adopt less harmful routes of administration .
This " Selected issue " is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( http : / / www.emcdda.europa.eu / publications / selected @-@ issues / injecting @-@ drug @-@ use ) from December 2009 .
The lowest proportions of injectors among opioid users entering treatment are reported by Denmark and the Netherlands , and the highest by Lithuania , Latvia and Romania ( 120 ) .
Treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . For example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
This is the case in almost all of the 22 reporting countries .
The available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the prevalence of injecting drug use .
The lack of data makes drawing conclusions on time trends in the prevalence of injecting difficult , although the available data suggest a stable situation in the Czech
An increase was also observed in Cyprus .
The proportion of injectors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . This trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e.g. Czech Republic , Germany ) .
Between 2002 and 2007 , the proportion of injectors among primary opioid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statistically significant declines reported in 13 countries .
Other studies generally confirm a declining trend of injection among opioid users .
In France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly

Comorbidity : drug use and mental disorders
Co @-@ morbidity is the often unrecognised co @-@ occurrence of drug use problems and psychiatric disorders in the same individual .
Opioid analgesics are the most powerful drugs available for the management of severe and chronic pain .
Opioids are also used as substitution drugs in the management of opioid dependence .
These drugs , available on prescription , can be misused and this may lead to adverse health effects such as dependence , overdose and harms associated with injection .
Prescription opioids may enter the illicit drug market through the diversion of substitution drugs from their proper use .
Internet pharmacies seem also to play a substantial role in the availability of prescription opioids in the United States ( INCB , 2009a ) , but their role in Europe appears to be limited .
In Europe , the expansion in the prescription of substitution drugs to opioid @-@ dependent drug users has been accompanied by increasing reports of the misuse of these drugs .
The mental disorders most commonly reported among drug users in Europe include depression , anxiety , schizophrenia , personality disorders , attention deficit and hyperactivity .
National experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
In seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
A European prospective multi @-@ centre study ( Isadora ) has recently been conducted involving dual @-@ diagnosis patients
Its findings highlight the difficulties of comparative analyses in this area , underlining the need for a more harmonised approach for diagnosis , treatment and study of co @-@ morbidity in Europe ( Baldacchino et al . , 2009 ) .
Opioids other than heroin are reported as the primary drug by about 5 % ( 17 810 ) of clients entering drug treatment in Europe .
The German Phar @-@ Mon system , which monitors a wide range of medications that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of prescription opioids , where substitution drugs play a more important role than analgesics ( Roesner and Küfner , 2007 ) .
in the Member States that have joined the EU since 2004 are on average younger than their counterparts .
The misuse of prescription opioids raises important issues regarding the prevention of diversion of substitution drugs and opioid analgesics to the illicit market .
At the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substances is not compromised ( Cherny et al . , 2006 ) .
Female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
) See Table TDI @-@ 113 in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
Opioid users entering treatment report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) .
High levels of psychiatric disorders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a concomitant psychiatric morbidity were primary opioid users ( 125 ) .
Treatment of problem opioid use
The mean age of clients entering outpatient treatment for primary opioid use is 33 years and almost all countries
Almost all opioid users entering treatment report initiation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .
An average time lag of about 8 years is reported between have reported an increase since 2003 ( 123

In a few countries , inpatient centres are a major component of the drug treatment system , notably in Bulgaria , Greece , Finland and Sweden ( 127 ) .
The range of options available in Europe for the treatment of opioid dependence is broad and increasingly differentiated , though it varies geographically in terms of accessibility and coverage .
Drug @-@ free and substitution treatment for opioid use are available in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway . In Turkey , the future use of substitution treatment is currently under study .
NB : The percentage of substitution treatment clients receiving their treatment from general practitioners in the Community is indicated on the map.Sources : Reitox national focal points .
Drug @-@ free treatment is a therapeutic approach , which generally requires individuals to abstain from all substances , including substitution medication .
especially for younger or first @-@ time clients , or due to difficulties in gaining access to substitution treatment .
In Greece for example , the waiting time for opioid substitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
In four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in substitution treatment .
According to expert estimates , the availability of opioid substitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of opioid users ( see Chapter 2 ) .
In those countries , drug @-@ free treatment is the treatment of choice for between 10 % and 25 % of opioid users .
The total number of clients receiving substitution treatment in the EU , Croatia and Norway is estimated to be about 650 000 in 2007 , up from 560 000 in 2005 and 500 000 in 2003 .
A simple comparison of the estimated number of problem opioid users and of delivered treatments suggests that more than 40 % could be receiving substitution treatment .
However , there is still a lack of precision in both data sets , and this estimate should be viewed with caution .
A set of minimum requirements and international guidelines for psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment of persons dependent on opioids was recently developed by WHO ( 2009 ) .
Drugrelated infectious diseases highest rates of newly reported infections , Portugal and Estonia continued their downward trends , although in Portugal this trend seems to be levelling off .
In contrast , in Latvia an increase from 47.1 cases per million population in 2006 to 58.7 cases per million in 2007 was reported ( Figure 12 ) .
Infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B and C are among the most serious health consequences of drug use .
The EMCDDA is systematically monitoring HIV and hepatitis B and C among injecting drug users ( prevalence of antibodies , or other specific markers in the case of hepatitis B ) ( 129 ) .
Overall , marked increases in new HIV infection have not been observed between 2002 and 2007 , and reported rates remain low .
Prevalence data are

For hepatitis B , the proportion of injecting drug users has declined between 2002 and 2007 in four out of 17 countries .
The most complete data set available is that for the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen ( antiHBc ) , which indicates a history of infection .
For 2006 @-@ 07 , three of the 10 countries providing data on injecting drug users report anti @-@ HBc prevalence levels of over 40 % ( 137 ) .
Ten of these 23 countries also report existing strategies to prevent infectious diseases at local or regional level .
Hepatitis C prevalence as a possible indicator of injection @-@ related HIV risk
HCV is transmitted via needle sharing in similar ways to HIV .
Access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
Research has shown that sustained treatment is associated with reductions in injecting drug use and related risk behaviours , and thereby with protection from HIV infection .
See Table INF @-@ 115 in the 2009 statistical bulletin . )
Chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths drug users , involving peer educators , are also reported by 17 countries .
Treatment of injecting drug users with chronic hepatitis C
To reduce the burden of hepatitis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chronic carriers of the virus who are active drug injectors .
Needle and syringe programmes exist in all EU Member States , Croatia and Norway .
Current treatments for chronic hepatitis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination therapy with longacting interferon and ribavirin - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained virological response .
The number of syringes provided through needle and syringe programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
Access of drug users to hepatitis C treatment , however , remains low .
Ongoing increases over this period were reported from Belgium , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Austria , Slovakia and Finland .
Multidisciplinary teams , which can manage drug dependence , liver treatment and co @-@ morbid mental problems , improve treatment outcomes ( Grebely et al . , 2007 ) .
A national survey conducted in the 120 French " CAARUD " harmreduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 ( Toufik et al . , 2008 ) .
In the United Kingdom , a new needle exchange monitoring system was established in 2008 .
Lowthreshold facilities can provide the opportunity to deliver primary health care services and harm reduction interventions to hard to reach populations .
It was also considered as a cost @-@ effective innovation , capable of operating within the country 's restrictive drug policy ( Arponen et al . , 2008 ) .
( 140 ) Experts from 26 EU countries , Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to drug users . ( 141 ) See Table HSR @-@ 5 ( part i ) and ( part ii ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
) See Table HSR @-@ 5 ( part ii ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
Training in health promotion , based on formal curricula or training handbooks , is offered to staff of needle and syringe programmes in 20 countries and to pharmacists in nine countries .
Known causes of deaths include acute toxicity , traffic accidents in particular when combined with alcohol ( EMCDDA , 2007c ) , violence , suicide among already vulnerable people , or chronic conditions due to repeated use ( e.g. cardiovascular problems in cocaine users ) .
While most drugrelated deaths occur among problem drug users , some occur among other groups of users , including those using drugs only occasionally ( 143 ) .
Druginduced deaths
The number of deaths can be influenced
Drug use is one of the major causes of health problems and death among young people in Europe .
Figure 13 : Mortality rates among all adults ( 15 @-@ 64 years ) due to druginduced deaths
40 a te per million R
During the period 1990 @-@ 2006 , between 6 400 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States , Croatia , Norway and Turkey , adding up to more than 135 000 deaths . In 2006 , the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths .
Population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
Rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .
Among Europeans aged 15 @-@ 39 years , drug overdose accounted for 4 % of all deaths ( 145 ) .
Deaths related to opioids
Opioids , mainly heroin or its metabolites , are present in the majority of druginduced deaths reported in Europe .
In the 22 countries providing data , opioids accounted for 35 % to almost 100 % of all cases , with 11 of these countries reporting proportions of over 85 % ( 146 ) .
Other substances are also found in the toxicology reports in addition to heroin .
The most frequently reported are alcohol , benzodiazepines , other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
This suggests that a substantial proportion of all druginduced fatalities may be related to polydrug use .
Men account for most heroin overdose deaths occurring in Europe ( 82 % ) .
An epidemic of fentanyl poisonings in Estonia caused the death of 117 injecting drug users in 2005 / 06 ( EMCDDA , 2008b ) .

Chapter 7 : Drugrelated infectious diseases and drugrelated deaths instance , in the case of mortality related to HIV / AIDS , Eurostat and EuroHIV information is combined .
This suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered druginduced deaths .
This type of study can determine overall and cause @-@ specific mortality rates for the cohort , and can estimate the group 's excess mortality compared to the general population .
Both methods have been successfully pilot @-@ tested in the Czech Republic , and the EMCDDA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
France , Italy and Portugal . Following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 , HIV / AIDS mortality decreased markedly in most EU countries , although the decrease was much less pronounced in Portugal .
Recent increases have also been reported in Latvia .
At present , estimated HIV / AIDS mortality rates among drug users are low in most countries , except in Spain and Portugal .
In Italy , France and Latvia , HIV / AIDS mortality and overdose mortality are of similar levels ( 153 ) .
Deaths indirectly related to drug use
Other diseases that also account for a proportion of deaths among drug users include chronic conditions such as liver diseases ( due to hepatitis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardiovascular problems .
Other causes have received much less attention , despite indications that they have a considerable impact .
For instance , trauma ( accidents , homicides and other violence ) and suicide could account for 25 % or more of the mortality of problem drug users . A literature review

See Figure DRD @-@ 7 ( part ii ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
In recent cohort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . However , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited availability of data .
Reducing drugrelated deaths families of drug users to recognise and manage drug overdoses ; in eight countries , such materials are available for police officers ; and in seven countries , they have been developed for prison staff ( 155 ) .
Education about overdose risk is reported by all countries , and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users .
Thirteen countries have neither a specific strategy or a section of the national drug strategy dedicated to the reduction of druginduced deaths , and two countries reported no information .
Drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
Overdose response training is not available in Estonia , Hungary and Turkey .
Being in treatment lowered the risk of death to four times that of the general population , confirming thereby that drug treatment reduces drugrelated mortality .
Individual overdose risk assessments are conducted by trained staff , and aim at identifying those in need of additional support .
No information is available from Bulgaria , Germany and France .
No information is available from Bulgaria .
Experts from 26 EU countries , Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to prevent drugrelated deaths . )
See Table HSR @-@ 8 ( part ii ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
In England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 506 drug overdose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .
During the first 3 months , all 12 overdoses where naloxone was used had been reversed successfully , while one death had occurred in the six overdoses in which it was not used .
According to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @-@ release counselling on overdose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .
Milloy and colleagues calculated the number of deaths potentially averted by the operation of the drug consumption facility in Vancouver .
They estimated that between two and 12 deaths a year may have been averted ( Milloy et al . , 2008 ) .
This confirms earlier findings regarding the likely beneficial effect of these facilities on overdose deaths in neighbourhoods where coverage is sufficient .
Chapter 8New drugs and emerging trends
During 2008 , 13 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time in the EU through the early @-@ warning system .
Besides new synthetic drugs , which accounted for 11 of the newly notified substances , the group included two plants , but no medicinal products .
The chemical make @-@ up of the two plants reported - kratom and kava - is relatively well known from the literature .
They have been traditionally used in other parts of the world and their presence on the European drug scene seems to be limited .
The use of new psychoactive substances and new patterns of drug use can have important public health and policy implications .
They are , however , difficult to detect because , typically , they first emerge at low levels and in specific localities or among restricted subgroups of the population .
Few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to new phenomena in the drug field , and methodological difficulties to detect them are considerable .
Nonetheless , the importance of identifying potential new threats is widely recognised .
The European Union 's early @-@ warning system provides a quick @-@ response mechanism to the emergence of new psychoactive substances on the drug scene .
Most of the newly reported synthetic compounds are psychotropic substances similar to those listed in Schedules I and II of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances .
Of the new substances reported in 2008 , compared with previous years , fewer belong to the main chemical groups - phenethylamines ( one ) , tryptamines ( two ) and piperazines ( none ) .
Notably , six of the newly notified substances are cathinone derivatives .
Most of the new synthetic substances have stimulant properties , while only three produce hallucinogenic effects .
More than 90 substances have been reported through the early @-@ warning system since its establishment in 1997 .
Until recently , phenethylamines and tryptamines accounted for a large proportion of notifications .
However , in the past few years , a much more diverse range of substances has appeared .
The appearance of synthetic cannabinoids marks the latest stage in the development of " designer drugs " : from those based on fentanyl in the 1980s ; to ring @-@ substituted phenethylamines in the late 1980s and tryptamines in 1990s ; to piperazines and cathinone derivatives in the 2000s .
Psychoactive plants reported through the early @-@ warning system
Products of five psychoactive plants have been reported in recent years .
The species detected by the early @-@ warning system are not under international control , but may be controlled by EU Member States .
doses , kratom has opioid @-@ like effects , and has been used in traditional medicine to treat pain and opioid withdrawal .
The main active principles of kratom are mitragynine , mitraphylline and 7 @-@ hydroxymitragynine ; though mitragynine is probably responsible for kratom 's analgesic activity and for relieving the opioid withdrawal symptoms .
The plant , mitragynine and 7 @-@ hydroxymitragynine are controlled in Denmark , while Lithuania controls the plant and mitragynine .
Kava ( Piper methysticum ) is a shrub that has been used for centuries in the South Pacific Islands for ceremonial purposes .
A tea brewed from the roots of the plant can be taken for its anti @-@ anxiety and relaxant effects .
Concern has been growing that long @-@ term use of kava can cause liver damage .
Neither the plant or its active principles ( kavalactones ) are reported to be controlled in any EU Member State .
Salvia divinorum is a perennial herb native to southern Mexico , where due to its hallucinogenic properties it is traditionally used for ceremonial purposes .
The main active principle , salvinorin @-@ A , is a potent kappa opioid receptor agonist .
Recreational modes of use of Salvia include chewing the leaves , and smoking or sublingual administration of concentrated extracts , which appear to produce intense effects .
Ingestion of the leaves or seeds of the plant produces a longer @-@ lasting , but less intense effect .
Salvia divinorum or its active principles are controlled in six Member States and Croatia .
Khat is comprised of leaves and fresh shoots of Catha edulis , a shrub cultivated in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula .
It is used as a mild stimulant by chewing the fresh vegetable matter .
The active components , cathinone and cathin , are close chemical relatives of synthetic drugs such as amphetamine and methcathinone , and are internationally controlled under the 1971 UN Convention .
Catha edulis is controlled in 12 EU Member States .
Kratom ( Mitragyna speciosa ) is a tree native to southeast Asia .
The leaves can be chewed , smoked or brewed into a tea .
At low doses , it has stimulant effects .
LSA is controlled as a drug in Ireland and the United Kingdom .
Products marketed on the Internet and in some specialised shops under the name " spice " have been available since at least 2006 . Although " spice " may be advertised as incense , when smoked the effects are described by some users as similar to those of cannabis .
Following a report from Sweden , the early @-@ warning system has been monitoring " spice " products since the beginning of 2008 .
The chemical structure of JWH @-@ 018 differs substantially from that of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the main active principle in all cannabis products .
In experimental animals , JWH @-@ 018 produces the same effects as THC , and has been reported to be more potent .
Early in 2009 , a second synthetic cannabinoid , CP 47,497 ( 160 ) , and three of its homologues were detected in " spice " samples in Europe .
Synthetic cannabinoids have been identified only in a limited number of samples , and in varying amounts .
It would appear that these synthetic substances have been added surreptitiously , as packaging information on " spice " products only mentions herbal ingredients .
Packaging information on " spice " products indicates that they are composed of as many as 14 ingredients of plant origin .
While at least two of the ingredients - Pedicularis densiflora and Leonotis leonurus - may have some psychoactive effect , little is known about the pharmacology and toxicology of the plant materials purportedly contained in " spice " products .
Thus , no definite statements can be made as to the potential health risks or possible psychoactive effects of these products .
Synthetic ingredients are not mentioned in the product information .
The substances JWH @-@ 018 and CP 47,497 and its homologues are not known to have been widely used as psychoactive drugs , in their own rights .
The online marketplace has implications for the potential spread of new psychoactive substances , and monitoring it is an increasingly important element of identifying new drug trends .
In particular , it is necessary to focus on the risks associated with the substances offered for sale .
Information about new products is needed by both the users and professionals , including clinical toxicologists , poison control specialists and those working in the drugs field .
Across the 26 countries studied , three distinct approaches to risk assessment are apparent .
In six countries , national risk assessment is not carried out .
Generally , these countries rely on risk assessments carried out at international or European level .
In seven countries , national risk assessment may be carried out on an ad @-@ hoc basis , when necessary .
To identify current developments in the online drug market , the EMCDDA conducts an annual snapshot study .
In 2009 , a total of 115 online shops were surveyed .
Based on the country code domains and other information on the websites , these online shops appear to be located in 17 European countries .
The majority of online retailers identified were based in the United Kingdom ( 37 % ) , Germany ( 15 % ) , Netherlands ( 14 % ) and Romania ( 7 % ) .
Hallucinogenic mushrooms containing psilocin and psilocybin were not offered for sale in any of the online shops surveyed in 2009 , unlike 2008 .
However , four online retailers based in France and the Netherlands offered scelerotia - the hardened mycelium of the hallucinogenic mushrooms Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe tampanensis .
Six countries do or might provide for the possibility of consultation with independent scientists , if a need is perceived .
And , in three countries ( Netherlands , Austria , United Kingdom ) , risk assessment is performed by independent scientific bodies .
New products offered for sale in 2009 include a range of herbal smoking products and " party pills " containing new legal alternatives to benzylpiperazine ( BZP ) .
There has also been an increasing focus on snuff products or herbal powders .
See ELDD Legal reports for further information ( http : / / eldd.emcdda.europa.eu ) .
" Spice " products ( 161 ) were offered for sale by 48 % of the retailers surveyed .
Concern about " spice " products has led to a number of countries taking legal action to ban or otherwise control these substances .
By March 2009 , " spice " products had been withdrawn from online shops based in Germany , Austria and France .
Austria used its medicines act to prohibit smoking mixes containing six synthetic cannabinoids from being imported or marketed in the country .
Luxembourg decided to control various synthetic cannabinoids as psychotropic substances . Poland amended the narcotic law , placing under control JWH @-@ 018 and two of the claimed herbal ingredients of " spice . "
Internet : a marketplace for psychoactive substances
In 2009 , alternative smoking blends to " spice " started to appear on the online marketplace .
The retailers surveyed offered for sale at least 27 different herbal smoking blends as alternatives to " spice . "

Member States shall endeavour to take this action , as soon as possible , but no later than 1 year from the date of the decision .
At the time of the preparation of this report ,
17 Member States ( 163 ) have reported that they have controlled BZP .
Since BZP became subject to control measures in EU Member States , this substance may no longer be used in " party pills " sold as legal alternatives to ecstasy .
At the beginning of 2009 , many online retailers were offering BZP @-@ free " party pills . "
Snuff products are marketed as an alternative to controlled drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines .
The products are purported to contain caffeine and a range of other plant @-@ based ingredients such as Acorus calamus , Hydrastis canadensis and Tilia europea .
Follow @-@ up on substances
Few countries report prevalence data on GHB and ketamine , and the prevalence estimates that are reported remain at much lower levels than for other illicit drugs .
Changes in the situation are difficult to assess due to prevalence data being obtained from non @-@ probabilistic samples with limited comparability over time and between samples .
A study carried out at a London hospital reported 58 emergencies related to ketamine use in 2006 , and the same number in 2007 .
In 2008 , however , mCPP continued to be the most widely available new synthetic drug on the illicit drug market , encountered alone or in combination with MDMA .
This is evidenced both by the number of seizures and the amount of seized material reported to the EMCDDA and Europol .
It is still unclear if the substance is used to enhance or mimic some of the effects of MDMA or simply as a " cutting agent . "
However , as mCPP is not a controlled substance in most Member States , it is likely that seizures are under @-@ reported .
On 3 March 2008 , the Council decided that Member States shall take the necessary measures , in accordance with their national law , to submit BZP to control measures proportionate to the risks of the substance , and criminal

Annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Luxembourg : Publications Office of the European Union
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) is one of the European Union 's decentralised agencies .
Established in 1993 and based in Lisbon , it is the central source of comprehensive information on drugs and drug addiction in Europe .
The EMCDDA collects , analyses and disseminates factual , objective , reliable and comparable information on drugs and drug addiction .
In doing so , it provides its audiences with an evidence @-@ based picture of the drug phenomenon at European level .
The annual report presents the EMCDDA 's yearly overview of the drug phenomenon in the EU and is an essential reference book for those seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .

Drugs and crime - a complex relationship
EN C of drug use and problem drug users are frequently found to be offenders .
However , the relationship between drugs and crime is neither simple nor linear .
Nor is it universal : many repeat offenders are not involved in drug use and many dependent drug users do not commit any crimes ( other than drug use / possession , where it is criminalised ) .
demonstration of wealth and status .
And some may go on to become more regular or dependent drug users , which can in turn lead to their increased involvement in crime or the drug market .
However , a necessary prerequisite to discussion on the extent of this problem and for considering the impact of interventions is an agreed conceptual framework for describing the problem .
This is also recognised in the current EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) , where the development of a common definition of drug @-@ related crime is an explicit action .
In this policy briefing the different types of offences that might be encompassed under a general heading of drug @-@ related crime are explored .
Although studies do not show any strong link between experimental drug use and offending , they do tend to show that delinquency often precedes involvement with illicit drugs .
This is especially true for those drugs particularly associated with dependence and problems , such as heroin or crack cocaine .
Studies have also shown that dependent drug users may commit acquisitive crimes as a means of supporting their drug habits .
For the career criminal , drugs may form part of the deviant lifestyle , with spending on drugs being a
Studies have revealed various risk factors ( some common , some not ) for involvement in offending and in drug use .
The term " drugrelated crime " is used here to encompass four types of crimes .
Systemic crimes : crimes committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets , as part of the business of drug supply , distribution and use .
Drug law offences : crimes committed in violation of drug ( and other related ) legislations .
Key issues at a glance
Defining drug @-@ related crime to assess its extent and patterns
A definition of drug @-@ related crime
" The need to reduce drug @-@ related crime is now recognised as an important policy objective in Europe .
Marcel Reimen , Chairman , EMCDDA Management Board psychotic episodes of behaviour and may well exacerbate existing behavioural problems .
That said , no psychoactive substance can be said to have universal criminogenic properties and both individual and environmental factors can influence how the use of psychoactive substances impacts on behaviour .
The effects of such drugs include excitability , irritability , fear / paranoia , disinhibition , drastic mood swings , cognitive distortions and impaired judgement , any of which may lead to criminal behaviour .
It is also important to include in this category crimes induced by the victim 's own drug use . Such crimes are less visible , because many go unreported .
However , such a definition of drug @-@ related crime is essential to any attempt to assess its extent , patterns and trends .
In practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some subgroups of the population of drug @-@ using offenders or to some types of drug @-@ related crime .
It is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may vary even in the same person over time .
Dependence on an expensive substance can lead users to engage in criminal acts to obtain the money they use to fund their drug habit .
They may resort to both consensual crimes , such as drug selling or prostitution ( where criminalised ) , and acquisitive crimes ( e.g. shoplifting , robbery , burglary ) .
Such offenders are sometimes paid in drugs .
This category of drug @-@ related crime also includes the forging of prescriptions and the burgling of pharmacies by drug users , both of which provide medicines that can be used as substitutes for illicit products .
Much of the existing research supports the view that there is a strong association between alcohol intoxication and psychopharmacologically induced crime , especially violence .
Following a long way behind alcohol in this regard are the stimulants - cocaine / crack and amphetamines .
The use of opiates and cannabis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psychopharmacologically induced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tranquillisers ) tend to reduce violent impulses and aggression .
However , irritability associated with the withdrawal syndrome , as well as related mental health problems , may be linked to increased violence .
Although many acquisitive crimes committed by drug users are opportunistic , some require more skill and others involve some specialisation .
For example , fraud and embezzlement are white @-@ collar crimes that require a specific professional environment .
While the pharmacology of most illicit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behaviours are not fully understood although some substances , usually stimulants , are known to produce
An increasingly common approach in empirical studies has been to apply the tripartite conceptual framework proposed by Goldstein for the relationship between drugs and crime .
In this model , drugs lead to violence through an integration of the psychopharmacological , economiccompulsive and systemic models .
Although it may not encompass all the possible relationships between drugs and crime , this approach does provide a useful conceptual framework for the analysis of drug @-@ related crime .
Additionally , from a policy perspective , it is helpful to include a legal definition model , in which crimes against drug laws are considered to be another type of drug @-@ related crime .
The resulting conceptual model , composed of four categories of drug crimes , is the basis for the definition of the term " drugrelated crime " used here , the individual components of which are discussed below .
Drug law offences
Many studies have been carried out on the links between drug use / traffi cking and crime , mostly in the United States .
those whose drug use needs to be supported by illegal income , which will be determined by their type and pattern of substance use , socioeconomic situation and extent of deviant lifestyle .
Many drug users utilise a combination of all these means .
However , some studies have attempted to estimate the proportion of different types of offence that are drug @-@ related and then apply this fraction to produce overall estimates of drug @-@ related crime .
Systemic criminality refers mainly to violent acts ( e.g. assaults , homicides ) committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets , as part of the business of drug supply , distribution and use .
Violence as a strategy of control is used in various situations including territorial disputes , punishment for fraud , debt collection and clashes with the police .
In drug production and transit countries where the rule of law is challenged , systemic crimes may also encompass , for example , corruption of businesses , governments and banking systems or crimes against humanity by drug traffickers. ckers .
Studies of drug @-@ related crime have often overlooked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by definition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
In addition , drug law offences account for a substantial share of law enforcement and criminal justice system activities and resources .
Systemic violence is linked to prohibition as it stems mainly from the illicit nature of a market characterised by huge profits and whose participants cannot resort to standard business law .
However , the pervasiveness of violence in drug markets may increase the likelihood of drug users becoming perpetrators or victims of violent crimes .
The four categories of drug @-@ related crime suggested , and the models on which they are derived , are not mutually exclusive .
Rather , the categorisation should be considered to demonstrate " ideal types " that allow drug @-@ related crime to be conceptualised and facilitate comparisons .
Indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
This would make such crimes relatively less costly ( through reduced probability of arrest and shortened incarceration ) and therefore may increase their incidence .

Cocaine use in Europe : implications for service delivery
EN C others , particularly in eastern Europe , treatment for opioid users , there are report only very limited use .
no proven effective substitution or pharmacological treatment options currently available for cocaine users .
An estimated 12 million ( 3.5 % ) European adults aged 15 @-@ 64 have tried cocaine and 4.5 million ( 1.3 % ) have used it in the last year .
Overall , cocaine supply , use and related problems in Europe have risen over the last decade , and prices have dropped .
However , this overall trend masks considerable inter @-@ country variation .
This paper addresses a number of important issues for the delivery of services for cocaine users .
How can the different groups of users be reached and helped ?
What type of treatment should be made available for dependent cocaine users ?
Are new specialised services needed , or should existing ones be adapted ?
And unlike
Cocaine is the hydrochloride salt produced from the leaves of the coca plant ( Erythroxylon coca Lam ) which is cultivated mainly in South America .
Powder cocaine is typically snorted ( insufflated ) and , less frequently , injected .
It produces euphoria and appetite suppression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .
Crack is the smokable form of cocaine and is manufactured from cocaine hydrochloride .
It is known for immediate effects and association with problematic patterns of use .
Key issues at a glance
Some 4.5 million European adults ( 1.3 % ) have used cocaine in the last year .
Last year cocaine prevalence has shown an overall upward trend over the last decade , although with variations between EU Member States , ranging from 0.1 % to 3.0 % of the population .
Cocaine use can lead to dependence and treatment demand related to cocaine has increased .
Psychiatric , cardiovascular and other health problems are also associated with cocaine use .
Injecting cocaine carries the risk of transmission of blood @-@ borne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.
Three core groups of problem cocaine users can be identified : socially well @-@ integrated individuals ; opioid users , some of whom are substitution treatment clients ; and marginalised crack users .

Growing cocaine use in Europe
Netherlands
Second only to cannabis , cocaine is among the most trafficked drugs in the world .
In 2005 , an estimated 752 tonnes were seized worldwide and 107 tonnes in Europe , with Spain accounting for about half of European seizures .
Overall , the quantities seized and the number of seizures have increased in Europe since 2000 , reaching around 70 000 cases in 2005 .
Average prices of cocaine have fallen in most reporting countries .
Source : EMCDDA Statistical bulletin , figure GPS @-@ 38 .
General population surveys show an increase in cocaine use in many EU countries , although this may now be slowing down in some Member States with the highest prevalence ( UK , Spain ) .
Cocaine use is more common among young adults aged 15 @-@ 34 ( Figure 1 ) and males .
The drug is often consumed alongside other illicit drugs and alcohol .
Acute and chronic cocaine use , often in combination with other substances , can cause multiple disorders ( cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , neurological , psychiatric , etc . ) .
Most reported cocaine deaths are the consequence of its chronic toxicity , leading to cardiovascular and neurological complications .
Cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
However , the extent of both the morbidity and mortality related directly to cocaine use remains difficult to estimate .
The first group uses powder cocaine alone or in combination with cannabis and / or alcohol .
This group is mainly composed of males , often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system or under the pressure of social and family networks .
Different groups of users
Cocaine users are spread across diverse social groups .
For example , surveys in recreational nightlife settings show prevalence rates 5 to 20 times higher among clubbers than among
The second group uses both opioids and cocaine .
Figure 2 : Evolution in number of first treatment demands with cocaine as the primary drug in 20 EU countries ( indexed to 100 in 1999 )
Cocaine and crack act on the reward system of the brain and repeated use can lead to dependence .
It is the third most commonly reported drug cited as the reason for entering drug treatment in the EU , with about 13 % of all treatment demands in 2005 .
However , there are considerable variations between countries .
In Spain and the Netherlands , cocaine accounts for respectively 40 % and 35 % of all treatment demands while this figure is 0 % in Finland and 0.1 % in Lithuania .
The number of treatment demands related to cocaine use has increased in recent years , notably among those entering treatment for the first time ( Figure 2 ) .
In 2005 , more than one in fi ve first treatment demands ( 21.5 % ) were cocaine @-@ related .

problems and are difficult to reach .
They might seek treatment and support at a later stage of their dependence and thus be more difficult to treat .
undergoing substitution treatment . National studies focusing on cocaine users in treatment report that this group is often the largest .
The way forward
Policies and interventions
Outside such locations , drug policies should address the growing diversity in drug use patterns and needs of problem drug users .
The third group uses crack cocaine , often in combination with opioids .
Its members are frequently highly marginalised , and may comprise a high proportion of ethnic minority members and people who are homeless , unemployed or in precarious labour conditions .
It is the smallest of the three groups ( 2.5 % of all European clients in treatment ) and has only been identified in a few locations .
The needs of different user groups
There are very few drug strategies which specifically target cocaine and crack cocaine use and only the UK and Ireland have implemented strategies at national and / or local level .
Most European countries report that cocaine users can access information about cocaine and the risks of cocaine use through various sources such as websites , helplines and interventions in the nightlife setting .
In some cities , especially those with significant crack cocaine use , harm @-@ reduction agencies also provide outreach interventions .
Cocaine and crack users represent a heterogeneous population with specific needs which may require tailored services .
Socially integrated powder cocaine users may need to be better informed about cocaine @-@ related risks .
They may also be reluctant to initiate or continue treatment among marginalised drug users and feel there is a stigma attached to users attending such services .
Currently , most reported cocaine treatment in Europe takes place in outpatient settings which are primarily oriented to the needs of opioid users .
However , socially integrated cocaine users are likely to seek help through other healthcare providers such as general practitioners or private clinics .
There is a growing interest for countries with significant cocaineusing populations to provide services tailored specifically to cocaine users .
The treatment of cocaine dependence relies mainly on psychosocial interventions , with pharmacological agents being used as a support by many clinicians .
However , until now , no effective pharmacological agent has emerged to manage cocaine abstinence and reduce craving .
Therefore , research and training in psychosocial interventions should be given highest priority .
The exchange of experiences and best practice among clinicians should be encouraged .
Research on pharmaceutical agents should also be supported and the results made rapidly available , both for positive as well as negative outcomes .
Finally , cocaine users who are undergoing opioid substitution treatment should be assessed to make sure that their cocaine use is not linked with too low a dosage of methadone or buprenorphine .
The co @-@ use of multiple substances also substantially increases the risk of additional health problems and the risk of death among this population .
Finally , crack cocaine often affects marginalised and deprived populations ( e.g. the homeless , sex workers ) .
However , as these approaches and the research about their effectiveness come almost exclusively from the
Interventions to reach socially integrated problem cocaine users and marginalised crack users also pose a challenge .
For crack users and marginalised populations of drug users , harm reduction outreach interventions , combined with service referral , need to be given higher priority .
Drugs in focus
Briefing of the European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
Drug addiction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibiting a loss of control over their consumption . Addicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
Modern developments in neurobiology help us to better understand this process .
Most neurobiological research on addiction has focused on the role a drug @-@ released neurotransmitter called dopamine has on the repeated activation of the " reward system " - circuitry made up of a complex set of cerebral structures which act as a barometer , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
Spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .
Neurotransmitter : a chemical produced and released by neurons .
Some of these molecules ( GABA , glutamic acid ) participate in the communication between neurons ; some others ( dopamine , noradrenaline , serotonin ) modulate ( amplify or attenuate ) the information .
Reward system : this brain circuit reinforces behaviour when activated .
Data indicate that drugs of abuse are pleasurable because they activate this system .
Neurobiological research tries to understand how addictive drugs produce neurochemical changes in the brain 's reward pathway , making their use appealing and producing a drive to use them repeatedly .
A growing body of research suggests that chronic drug use can produce long @-@ term disruptions in the modulation of neurocognitive circuits involved in motivation and attention , decision @-@ making and the ability to inhibit impulses .
Neuroscience and genetic research promise to provide a detailed causal explanation in terms of brain processes .
1st issue 2009
Neurobiological research in addiction and that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse disrupts this regulation .
Over time , noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons become autonomous and hyper @-@ reactive to external stimuli and arguably this druginduced long @-@ term uncoupling explains dysfunctions in motivation and in the ability to inhibit impulses .
" Developments in neuroscience are transforming our understanding of how people become addicted to drugs while opening @-@ up avenues of investigation for new approaches to treatment .
We must , however , ensure that such beneficial new approaches are rigorously evaluated prior to implementation to ensure maximum success and financial efficiency . "
Almost all drugs known to induce abuse or addiction in humans increase the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine in a sub @-@ cortical structure , the nucleus accumbens .
The cell bodies of neurons which release dopamine are located in the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra ( see figure ) .
These dopaminergic neurons form the meso @-@ corticolimbic pathway .
They stimulate different cerebral structures , such as the prefrontal cortex , the amygdala and the hippocampus , which are part of a circuitry called the " reward system . "
Animal studies and other evidence suggest great variability in vulnerability to addiction .
New technologies mean that neurobiological research can start to identify neuropsychological and genetic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addiction if they use drugs .
New technologies in addiction research non @-@ invasive techniques which may help to identify neuropsychological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's inability to stop using drugs .
Traditional and newtreatments of addiction
This dysregulation would correspond either to an increased reactivity of dopaminergic neurons to specific stimuli linked to the pleasurable and addictive product or to a down @-@ regulation of dopamine signalling and a dampening of activity in the reward pathway .
In natural situations , dopamine is released when a rewarding experience is new , better than expected or unanticipated .
This release of dopamine helps the individual to memorise signals announcing a reward .
Newmodels in theneurobiology of addiction
In humans , genetic studies have tried to identify specific addiction susceptibility genes .
Addiction has traditionally been treated by a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments .
Nicotine replacement therapy is a common form of substitution treatment for smoked tobacco but is not particularly effective .
Some treatments may also be used for a short period to help wean individuals off all drugs .
Psychosocial interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy , motivational interviewing , drug counselling or 12 @-@ step support groups .
These therapies provide an important adjunct to pharmacological and medical treatments in achieving a long @-@ term successful outcome .
Some recent studies suggest that , despite the critical and unquestionable role dopamine plays in reward , drugs of abuse may not necessarily induce addiction via a direct effect on dopaminergic neurons .
There is some evidence that dopamine acts downstream to two other neuromodulators , noradrenaline and serotonin , responsible for vigilance and for the control of impulsivity , respectively .
Animal studies indicate that noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons are coupled ( i.e. limit the activity of each other )
Progress in neurobiological research on addiction has led to the use of drugs which target the dopaminergic system . However , this strategy has not yet proven effective in
Causal models of addiction treating addiction , possibly because the wrong dopamine receptor has been targeted ( i.e. D2 ) or because other modulatory neurotransmitter systems also require consideration .
choices or act upon them . Drug use encompasses a complex set of behaviours and even the autonomy of dependent individuals is variable .
Ethical and policyimplications
How addiction is understood by society is important for deciding which responses are appropriate .
Even today , some authors remain sceptical about the existence of addiction , and the extent to which dependent individuals have autonomy over their actions remains a question of fundamental importance .
A number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being researched which may provide new approaches to treating some forms of drug dependence .
Neurosurgery is the most invasive and permanent form of experimental treatment , but there exist strong ethical objections to this approach .
A less invasive approach is transcranial magnetic stimulation that involves placing a small magnetic coil against an individual 's skull in order to block or enhance neural activity .
Dopaminergic projections from midbrain to forebrain
Projections from the midbrain also make connections with the caudate and the putamen ( labelled Striatum in the figure ) . Source : Hyman et al . , 2006 .
Neurobiological research can make a significant contribution to our understanding of the extent to which addicts are autonomous , and therefore responsible for their actions .
The autonomy of addicts in making choices about their drug use is undoubtedly impaired when they are acutely intoxicated or experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms .
If neurobiological research leads to the development of new treatment approaches , they will join and hopefully complement existing treatments .
Patients will need to be given information on different treatment options , and the costs and benefits of any new therapy should be carefully considered along with its potential efficacy .
Treatments that are invasive or dangerous are difficult to justify if safer options already exist .
A generally accepted ethical principle is that care available in prison settings should be equivalent to that available to the wider community .
Ethical concerns would arise if new therapies were disproportionately targeted on those in custody and other treatments of proven efficacy denied .

Conclusions and policy considerations
Neurobiological research provides support for a " medical model " of addiction .
New methodologies such as neuroimaging and genetic research may help to better understand variations in vulnerability to addiction , even if social factors are also clearly important .
However , the extent to which this can be used in practice remains questionable .

Responding to drug driving in Europe
Until then , this policy briefing summarises the key issues facing policymakers and describes developments across Europe that may assist decision @-@ making on the topic .
and benzodiazepines are generally impairing ; of the opioids , heroin can impair severely , methadone less so , and buprenorphine even less .
The data for stimulant drugs such as cocaine , amphetamines and ecstasy are more mixed , but suggest that high doses are associated with impairment .
Yet , an objective measure for impairment for each drug , similar to the blood alcohol concentration , remains elusive .
Reducing the loss of life caused by driving under the influence of psychoactive substances requires measures that are based on a scientific understanding of this complex phenomenon .
The challenge to legislators is to design sound and effective laws that can be enforced , and that give a clear message to the public .
Alcohol alone is estimated to account for up to 10 000 road deaths a year in the European Union , one quarter of all road deaths .
No comparable figures are available for road accidents related to illicit drugs and psychoactive medicines , though these have been receiving increasing attention over the past decade .
The latest research suggests that cannabis can reduce performance
DRUID aims to provide a solid basis for harmonised , EU @-@ wide regulations for driving under the influence of alcohol , drugs and medicine .
Definition
Reports of drug driving incidents often receive much media
Various psychoactive medicines , which might or might not be legally prescribed and consumed , can impair driving skills .
But , few countries have reliable statistics on the prevalence of driving under the influence of drugs .
Obtaining sound scientific evidence on behavioural effects ,
Currently , police experience considerable difficulty with the accurate and rapid identification of drug driving at the roadside .
prevalence and accident risk is difficult with the available data .
Many of the studies have small samples and it is often difficult to generalise from their results .
Key audiences may not be hearing the message , or they may be ignoring it .
Reflecting the scientific debate about the precise effects of the substances , the legal definition of the offence of driving under the influence of drugs differs among EU Member States .
Extent of drug driving is not studied in many European countries
The number of people sampled has ranged from under 50 to over 10 000 , with more than one third of the studies reporting on fewer than 500 individuals .
Studies on drug prevalence in drivers published between 1999 and 2007 provide data for only 13 of the 27 EU Member States and Norway .
medicines and illicit drugs , others do .
In Finland and Sweden , new zero @-@ tolerance laws for illicit drugs were passed following the experience that the offence of impaired driving was extremely difficult to prove .
In Cyprus , this problem is addressed by prosecuting such drivers for illegal consumption of drugs .
However , Belgium and the United Kingdom specifically prohibit use of a test result for drug driving as evidence for any other offence .
National legislation or policies may also limit the scope and comparability of prevalence studies .
For example , random roadside tests for drugs are not permitted in most countries .
In some countries , tests are only carried out for illicit drugs , and the prevalence of psychoactive medicines cannot be ascertained .
Random roadside surveys of drivers , which can give a representative picture of the entire driving population , are available for three EU Member States and Norway .
Other surveys provide data on drug use among specific subsets of drivers .
However , the results of these various studies are not scientifically comparable .
A positive test for alcohol may override any requirement for drug testing , with resource limitations and prosecution requirements taking priority over any need for comprehensive data gathering .
This has been the case in Denmark , Estonia , Ireland and Portugal .
Evidence of drug @-@ taking may be detected in different biological samples , including blood , urine , saliva , sweat and even hair .
Blood is the ideal matrix for legal proof of impairment , but roadside screening by oral fluid ( saliva ) is desirable for convenience .
Threshold levels for the drugs may be set at the lower limit of detection , or at levels where impairment may be expected to start .
However , while some drugs , including cannabis and opioids , appear to have a dosedependent impairing effect , others such as amphetamines do not .
Tolerance and interactions with alcohol or other drugs complicate calculations further .
In France , drivers found combining drugs with alcohol receive a higher penalty .
Responding to psychoactive medicines
Generally , cannabis is the most common illicit substance detected , and benzodiazepines are the most commonly reported psychoactive medicines .
New international guidance for standardisation of study designs have been drawn up with the assistance of the EMCDDA and the European Commission 's DG Transport .
Where to draw the line - or lines ?
Barriers to building up scientific evidence
Psychoactive medicines , such as painkillers ( opioids ) , sedatives ( benzodiazepines ) , antidepressants and antihistamines can have sometimes considerable effects on the capabilities of drivers .
Results from studies suggest that drivers may be using these drugs either for medical reasons following prescription , or misusing them , sometimes together with illicit substances .
Concern is also growing about the possible impact of the increasing numbers of drug users receiving opioid substitution treatment .
Most European countries take one of two approaches to defining the offence of driving under the influence of drugs .
Eleven countries only penalise impaired driving , whether caused by illicit drugs or medicines .
Eleven other countries have adopted a " zero @-@ tolerance " policy , penalising any driving after drug @-@ taking .
In seven countries , these two approaches are combined in a tiered response to drug driving offenders .
Most countries " laws penalise impairment from any drug , whether illicit or medicinal .
In France , Austria and Portugal , some impairing psychoactive medicines such as benzodiazepines are not covered by the drug driving law , though they may be
More than 30 studies on the prevalence of drugs among drivers have been carried out across Europe since 1999 .
However , these studies have used various methods and sampled different groups of drivers , making it difficult to draw overall conclusions .
In the EU , while France uses roadside saliva tests , prosecution is based on the results of a blood test .
These tests may include , for example , examination of the size of the pupils , coordination tests , behavioural tests , reactions and manner of speaking .
Yet by 2007 , only four EU countries ( Belgium , Portugal , Sweden , United Kingdom ) reported obligatory training in this area for traffic police , while 11 reported some ad hoc training .
Furthermore , the tests are not the same in each country .
covered by a general offence such as dangerous driving .
In contrast , laws in the Czech Republic , Estonia , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia penalise driving with any trace of a substance , even if medicinal .
In Latvia , impairment by a medicinal substance will incur a lower fine than any trace of an illicit substance .
They also show that many drivers are unaware of the effects of combining drugs and alcohol .
After stopping a driver , the police officer may need to perform an initial screening for drug use , by analysing behaviour or biological samples .
Oral fluid ( saliva ) might be acceptable for roadside screening of drivers - urine is not appropriate to indicate impairment .
The reliability of devices for roadside saliva testing , however , has yet to be confirmed .
Of the nine on @-@ site saliva @-@ testing devices evaluated by the EU 's Rosita @-@ 2 project between 2003 and 2005 , not one could be recommended for roadside screening of drivers .
The limitations of the devices might be compensated to some extent by modifying the testing protocol .
Prevention campaigns targeting drug driving have been carried out in several EU Member States .
These generally take the form of mass media campaigns , often including information on drugs within a wider campaign focussing on alcohol .
Zero tolerance Impairment
General messages that reach young users of cannabis , however , are unlikely to be listened to , or even noticed , by older users of psychoactive medicines , and vice versa .
Similarly , both groups may feel that warnings about alcohol do not apply to them .
Prevention programmes are more likely to succeed if they are tailored to their target group .
Providing clear information to patients taking psychoactive medicines may prevent them from driving while adversely affected .
For this , most countries rely on the patient information leaflet inside the packaging , for example advising caution if the patient feels sleepy .
Yet the patient 's subjective senses are not always reliable or accurate .
The use of a clear symbol or pictogram on the outer packaging of medicines that may affect driving ability is currently reported by only five countries .

Responding to drug driving in Europe : Conclusions and policy considerations
National laws and their enforcement need to strike a balance between concerns about ensuring road safety and the therapeutic needs of individuals .
Surveys on the prevalence of drugs in drivers need to be conducted in all EU Member States .
Testing all drivers involved in a fatal accident for drug and alcohol use would provide an important source of information for monitoring the problem .
Legal frameworks require review , as even with the limitations of existing testing methodology , more effective procedures are possible .
And , new options are likely to become available .
New guidelines on study design are available that take into account the variety of legal and practical constraints in different countries .
Policymakers should consider the latest scientific information available when designing legal responses .

However , major environmental challenges remain which will have significant consequences for Europe if left unaddressed .
The result is a significant environmental footprint in Europe and elsewhere .
However , widespread alteration of landscapes , degradation of ecosystems and loss of natural capital mean that the EU will not meet its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 .
Natural resources and waste - Environmental regulation and eco @-@ innovation have increased resource efficiency through a relative decoupling of resource use , emissions and waste generation from economic growth in some areas .
However , absolute decoupling remains a challenge , especially for households .
This indicates scope not only to improve production processes further , but also to alter consumption patterns to reduce environmental pressures .
Environment , health and quality of life - Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas .
Links between the state of Europe 's environment and various global megatrends imply increasing systemic risks .
These interdependencies and trends , many of them outside Europe 's direct influence , will have significant consequences and potential risks for the resilience and sustainable development of Europe 's economy and society .
Increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved , for example , using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental impacts of products and activities .
This can reduce Europe 's dependence on resources globally and promote innovation .
Clustering sectoral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve coherence , address shared challenges efficiently , maximise economic and social benefits and help avoid unintended consequences .
Implementing environmental policies and strengthening environmental governance will continue to provide benefits .
Better implementation of sectoral and environmental policies will help ensure that goals are achieved and provide regulatory stability for businesses .
This includes reducing long @-@ term remediation costs through early action .
Transformation towards a greener European economy will ensure the long @-@ term environmental sustainability of Europe and its neighbourhood .
In this context , shifts in attitudes will be important .
Using education and various social media , citizens can be engaged in tackling global issues such as meeting the 2 ° C climate target .
The seeds for future actions exist : the task ahead is to help them take root and flourish .
The state of the environment in Europe
Europe relies heavily on natural capital and ecosystems at home and abroad
The Europe addressed in this report is home to around 600 million
With an average of 100 people per km2 , Europe is one of the most densely populated regions of the world ; some 75 % of the total population lives in urban
areas (
Europeans depend heavily on the stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem services that lie within and beyond Europe 's borders .
Two fundamental questions arise from this dependency .
Are the stocks and flows today being used sustainably to supply essential benefits , such as food , water , energy , materials , as well as climate and flood regulation ?
Are today 's environmental resources , i.e. air , water , soil , forests , biodiversity , secure enough to be able to sustain people and economies in good health in the future ?
Access to reliable up @-@ to @-@ date information about the environment provides a basis for action
To answer such questions , citizens and policymakers require accessible , relevant , credible , and legitimate information .
A further requirement is that the EEA publishes

The report does not present any warnings of imminent environmental collapse .
In other words , the current insufficient rate of progress observed over the past few decades in addressing environmental issues may severely undermine our ability to deal with potential future negative impacts .
Looking at the state of the environment and future challenges from different perspectives
Subsequent chapters assess , in more detail , key trends in the four environmental priority issues already mentioned .
Chapters 2 to 5 provide an assessment of the state of , trends in and prospects for each of these issues .
Chapter 6 reflects on the many direct and indirect connections across issues from the perspectives of natural capital and ecosystem services , focusing on land , soil and water resources .
Chapter 7 uses another lens by looking out to the rest of the world in terms of key socioeconomic and environmental megatrends that can be expected to affect Europe 's environment .
The final chapter , Chapter 8 , reflects on the findings of the previous chapters and their implications for future environmental priorities .

Indeed , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concluded that global warming since the middle of the 20th century is very likely to have been due to human
influences (
Recent observations give reason to believe that the rate of growth of GHG emissions and many climate impacts are approaching the upper boundary of the IPCC range of projections
rather than the lower ones (

The EU has been reducing its greenhouse gas emissions , and will meet its Kyoto obligation
Meeting the target of limiting global temperatures increases to less than 2 ° C will require a concerted global effort - including further substantial GHG emission reductions in Europe .
In 2008 , the EU was responsible for between 11 and 12 % of global GHG emissions ( 9 ) - while being home to 8 % of the world 's population .

A closer look at key sectoral greenhouse gas emissions reveals mixed trends
Historic trends of GHG emissions in the EU over the past 20 years are
• increases in the production of electricity and heat by thermal plants , which has increased both in absolute terms and in comparison with other sources ;
• economic growth in manufacturing industries ;
• increasing transport demand for passengers and freight ;
• and demographic changes over the past decades .
• fuel efficiency improvements in vehicles ;
• decreases in emissions from agriculture ( by more than 20 % since 1990 ) ;
• a shift from coal to less polluting fuels , particularly gas and biomass , for the production of electricity and heat ;

Towards a resource @-@ efficient transport system
The increases in greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector - as well as several other environmental impacts of transport - continue to be closely linked to economic growth .
The EEA 's annual Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism ( TERM ) report monitors the progress and effectiveness of efforts to integrate transport and environment strategies .
For 2009 , the report highlighted the following trends and findings :
The share of rail and inland waterways in the total freight volumes declined during that period .
• Passenger transport continued to grow but at a slower rate than the economy .
Air travel within the EU remained the fastest growth area , increasing 48 % between 1997 and 2007 .
Car journeys remained the dominant mode of transport , accounting for 72 % of all passenger kilometres in the EU @-@ 27 .
• Road traffic remains by far the largest source of exposure to transport noise .
The number of people exposed to damaging noise levels , especially at night , is expected to increase unless effective noise policies are developed and implemented in full ( see also Chapter 5 ) .
The process of establishing a new Common Transport Policy is essentially about creating this vision and then designing policies to achieve it .

Climate change is projected to have major impacts on ecosystems , water resources and human health
Climate change is projected to play a substantial role in biodiversity loss and puts ecosystem functions at risk .
Changing climatic conditions are responsible , for example , for the observed northward and uphill distribution shifts of many European plant species .
These are projected to need , for survival , to move several hundred kilometres to the north during the 21st century - which will not always be possible .
The timing of seasonal events , phenology , for plants and the life cycles of animal groups - both terrestrial and marine - alters with climatic change ( 6 ) .
Changes in seasonal events , flowering dates and agricultural growing seasons are observed and projected .
Phenology shifts have also increased the length of the growing season of several agricultural crops in northern latitudes over recent decades , favouring the introduction of new species that were not previously suitable .
At the same time , there has been a shortening of the growing season at southern latitudes .
Such changes in the cycles of agricultural crops are projected to continue - potentially severely impacting agricultural practices ( G
Similarly , climatic changes are expected to affect aquatic ecosystems .
Warming of surface water can have several effects on water quality , and hence on human use .
These include a greater likelihood for algal blooms to occur and the movement of freshwater species northwards , as well as changes in phenology .
A further major potential impact of climate change , in combination with land @-@ use changes and water management practices , is the

Adaptation ( 24 ) is a first step towards an adaptation strategy to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change , and complements actions at national , regional and even local levels .
Integration of adaptation into environmental and sectoral policy domains - such as those related to water , nature and biodiversity , and resource efficiency - is an important aim .
However , the EU White Paper on Adaptation recognises that limited knowledge is a key barrier and calls for a stronger knowledge base .
To address related gaps , the creation of a European clearinghouse on climate change impacts , vulnerability and adaptation is foreseen .
This aims to enable and encourage the sharing of information and good adaptation practices between all stakeholders .
Responding to climate change also affects other environmental challenges
Climate change is a result of one of the greatest market failures the world has seen ( 25 ) .
The issue is closely intertwined with other environmental issues as well as broader societal and economic developments .
Synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures are possible ( for example in the context of land and ocean management ) and adaptation can help increase resilience against other environmental challenges .
Many climate change mitigation measures will deliver ancillary environmental benefits including reductions in emissions of air pollutants from fossil fuel combustion .
Climate change policies are already reducing the overall cost of pollution abatement needed to meet the objectives of the EU 's
Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution ( 26

The implementation of measures to combat climate change is likely to deliver considerable ancillary benefits in air pollution abatement by 2030 .
This includes lower overall costs of controlling air pollutant emissions of the order of EUR 10 billion per year and a reduction in
Biodiversity loss degrades natural capital and ecosystem services
'Biodiversity ' includes all living organisms found in the atmosphere , on land and in water .
All species have a role and provide the ' fabric of life ' on which we depend : from the smallest bacteria in the soil to the largest mammal in the ocean ( 1 ) .
The four basic building blocks of biodiversity are genes , species , habitats and ecosystems ( A ) .
B and sustainable provisioning of natural resources (
Furthermore it is closely intertwined with other environmental issues , such as the adaptation to climate change or protecting human health .
Europe 's biodiversity is heavily influenced by human activities including agriculture , forestry and fisheries , as well as urbanisation .
Roughly half of Europe 's land area is farmed , most forests are exploited , and natural areas are increasingly fragmented by urban areas and infrastructural development .
Exploitation of natural resources typically leads to disturbance and changes in the diversity of species and habitats .
Over @-@ exploitation , however , can lead to degradation of natural ecosystems and ultimately to species extinctions .
2 ) turned the debate on biodiversity loss
Loss of biodiversity can thus lead to degradation of ' ecosystem services ' and undermine human well @-@ being .
Ecosystems provide a number of basic services that are essential for using Earth 's resources sustainably . These include :
• Supporting services - the processes that indirectly allow exploitation of natural resources , such as primary production , pollination ;
• Cultural services - the benefits people gain from the natural environment for recreational , cultural and spiritual purposes .
In this framework , biodiversity is the basic environmental asset .

The challenge is therefore to reduce Europe 's impact on the global environment while maintaining biodiversity at a level where ecosystem services , the sustainable use of natural resources and human wellbeing are secured .
The EU is committed to halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 .
It has become increasingly clear , however , that despite progress in

Most European data regarding the effects of pollutants on biodiversity and ecosystems concern acidification and eutrophication ( G
2 the 1970s .
The area subject to acidification has decreased further since
In 2010 , 10 % of the EEA @-@ 32 natural ecosystem area is , however , still subject to acid depositions beyond its critical load .
With sulphur emissions declining , nitrogen emitted by agriculture is now the principal acidifying component in our air ( 39 ) .
Agriculture is also a major source of eutrophication through emissions of excess nitrogen and phosphorous , both used as nutrients .
Phosphorous in freshwater systems stems mainly from run @-@ off from agriculture and discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants .
There has been a significant decline of phosphate concentrations in rivers and lakes , mainly due to progressive implementation of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive ( 41 ) since the early 1990s .
Current concentrations , however , often exceed the minimum level for eutrophication .
In some water bodies they are such that substantial improvements will be required to achieve good status under the Water Framework Directive ( WFD ) .
Paramount to attainment of good status by 2015 under the WFD ( will be a reduction in the excessive nutrient levels found in a number of water bodies across Europe , as well as the restoration of connectivity and hydro @-@ morphological conditions .

Overfishing not only reduces the total stock of commercial species , but affects the age and size distribution within fish populations , as well as the species composition of the marine ecosystem .
The average size of the fish caught has decreased , and there has also been a serious decrease in the numbers of large predatory fish species , which occupy the higher trophic levels ( 46 ) .
The consequences of this for the marine ecosystem are still poorly understood , but could be substantial .
While the Common Fisheries Policy ( CFP ) reform in 2002 stated conservation objectives , it is widely acknowledged that these have not been achieved .
An EU Green Paper on reforming the CFP in 2009 called for a complete reform of the way fisheries are managed ( 47 ) .
It acknowledges overfishing , fleet over @-@ capacity , heavy subsidies , low economic resilience and a decline in the biomass of fish caught by European fishermen .
This marks an important step towards implementation of an ecosystem @-@ based approach that regulates human exploitation of marine resources from the much wider perspective of ecosystem services .

The overall environmental impact of Europe 's resource use continues to grow
Europe relies heavily on natural resources ( A ) to fuel its economic development .
Past and current production and consumption patterns have underpinned substantial growth in wealth across Europe .
However , concerns about the sustainability of these patterns are mounting , particularly regarding the implications related to resource use and over @-@ use .
The assessment of natural resources and waste in this chapter complements the assessment of biotic natural resources in the previous chapter by focusing on material , and often non @-@ renewable , resources as well as water resources .
A life @-@ cycle perspective on natural resources addresses several environmental concerns related to production and consumption , and ties together the use of resources and the generation of waste .
In Europe , resource use and waste generation continue to rise .
While resource extraction within Europe has been stable over the past decade , dependence on imports is increasing ( 1 ) .
Environmental problems associated with the extraction and processing of many materials and natural resources are shifting from Europe to the respective exporting countries .
Consequently , the impacts of consumption and resource use from Europe on the global environment are increasing .

Waste prevention can help reduce environmental impacts during all stages of the life @-@ cycle of resources .
Although prevention has the highest potential to reduce environmental pressures , policies to reduce waste generation have been sparse and often not very effective .
For example , there has been an emphasis on diverting biowaste ,
Waste recycling ( and waste prevention ) is closely linked to material use .
Domestic material consumption ( DMC ) is an aggregate of materials ( excluding water and air ) which are actualy consumed by a national economy .

This continues to have considerable environmental and economic consequences .
The resource use category which increased most between 1992 and 2005 was that of minerals for construction and industrial use .
Differences between individual countries are significant : the use of resources per person varies by a factor of almost ten between the highest and the lowest numbers .
Factors that determine resource use per person include climate , population density , infrastructure , availability of resources , level of economic development , and the structure of the economy .
Although the level of extraction of resources within Europe has remained stable , and in some cases has even decreased - some unmanaged burdens from past extraction persist related to mining closures .
The high use of resources to fuel economic growth increases the problems of ensuring supplies and sustainable yields , and managing the environmental impacts in relation to ecosystems ' absorption capacities .
A challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental impacts that result from resource use ; several current initiatives aim to better quantify the environmental impacts of resource use .
Reducing resource use in Europe also reduces environmental impacts globally
European economies are creating more and more wealth from the resources that we use .
However , differences in resource efficiency across Europe are substantial , with a factor of almost ten between the most and least resource @-@ efficient EU economies .
Factors that affect resource efficiency include the technological level of production and consumption ; the share of services versus heavy industry ; regulatory and tax systems ; and the share of imports in total resource use .

Environment , health and quality of life
Environment , health , life expectancy and social inequalities are linked
The environment plays a crucial role in people 's physical , mental and social well @-@ being .
Despite significant improvements , major differences in environmental quality and human health remain between and within European countries .
The complex relationships between environmental factors and human health , taking into account multiple pathways and interactions , should be seen in a broader spatial , socioeconomic and cultural context .
On average , men are expected to live almost 81 % of their lives free of disability , and women 75 % ( 2 ) .
There are , however , differences between genders , and between Member States .
Reproductive and mental health problems are also on the rise .
Asthma , allergies ( 4 ) , and some types of cancer related to environmental pressures are of particular concern for children .

Due to uncertainties , the results need to be interpreted with caution as an indicative ranking of environmental health impacts only ( 6 ) .
The significant differences in the quality of the environment across Europe depend on the varying pressures related , for example , to urbanisation , pollution and natural resource use .
Exposures and associated health risks , as well as the benefits of pollution reduction and of a natural environment , are not uniformly distributed within populations .

Much progress has been achieved through dedicated approaches to improving the quality of the environment and reducing particular burdens on human health - but many threats remain .
Preserving and extending the benefits provided by the environment for human health and wellbeing will require continuous effort to improve the quality of the environment .
Meanwhile , new challenges are emerging with a wide range of potential , highly uncertain , ecological and human health implications .

Links between environmental challenges point towards increasing complexity
Today 's main environmental challenges are systemic in character and cannot be tackled in isolation .
The assessments of four environmental priority areas - climate change , nature and biodiversity , use of natural resources and waste , and environment and health - point to a series of direct and indirect links between environmental challenges .
Climate change , for example , impacts all other environmental issues .
Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect agricultural production as well as plant and animal distribution and phenology , and thus exert additional pressures on biodiversity ( Chapter 3 ) .
This may lead to species extinctions , particularly in arctic , alpine and coastal zones ( Chapter 2 ) .

biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation directly affect climate change and undermines the way we are able to use natural resources .
In addition , loss of natural infrastructure has been shown to have various harmful effects on human health ( Chapter 5 ) .
The use of natural resources and the resulting pollution of air , water and soil put pressure on nature and biodiversity through , for example , eutrophication and acidification ( Chapter 3 ) .
Ultimately , the use of non @-@ renewable natural resources , such as fossil fuels , is at the heart of the debate about climate change .
In addition , waste management is a key sector with regard to greenhouse gas emissions ( Chapter 2 ) .
How we use natural resources and dispose of wastes also links directly to several health aspects and contributes to the environmental burden of disease ( Chapter 5 ) .
Ultimately , environmental pressures that result from , for example , climate change , biodiversity loss , or the use of natural resources , are linked with people 's wellbeing ( Chapters 2 to 5 ) .
Access to clean water and air are paramount to our health , but is often undermined by pollution and waste that result from human activities ( Chapters 4 and 5 ) .
Many of the links described above and in the previous chapters are direct , i.e. changes in the state of one environmental issue can translate directly into pressures of another .
In addition , a number of indirect links occur with changes in one environmental issue resulting in feedbacks on another and vice versa .
Land use and land @-@ cover changes exemplify such indirect links .
They can be seen to be both a driver and an impact , not only of climate change , but also of biodiversity loss and the use of natural resources .
Most of the changes in the state of the environment described here are ultimately driven by unsustainable consumption and production patterns .
These have resulted in unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of renewable

Natural capital and ecosystem services
Natural capital and ecosystem services embrace many components .
Natural capital is the stock of natural resources from which goods can be extracted and the flows of ecosystem services maintained .
The stocks and flows rely on ecosystem structures and functions such as landscapes , soil , and biodiversity .
There are three main types of natural capital which require different approaches to managing them :
• non @-@ renewable and exhaustable resources - fossil fuels , metals , etc . ; • renewable but exhaustable resources - fish stocks , water , soil , etc . ; • renewable and non @-@ exhaustable resources - wind , waves , etc .
Natural capital provides several functions and services - it provides the sources of energy , food and materials ; the sinks for wastes and pollution ; the services of climate and water regulation , pollination ; and the space for living and leisure .
Using natural capital often involves trade @-@ offs between these functions and services .

Soil degradation is a major environmental concern with many dimensions , including :
• Soil erosion is the wearing away of the land surface by water and wind .
The main causes of soil erosion are inappropriate land management practices , deforestation , overgrazing , forest fires and construction activities .
Erosion rates are very sensitive to both climate and land use , as well as to detailed conservation practice at the field level .
Water erosion affects 115 million hectares ( ha ) of soil or 12 % of Europe 's total land area , and wind erosion 42 million ha .
The Mediterranean region is the most affected .
• Soil sealing occurs when agricultural or other rural land is built on and all soil functions are lost .
On average , built @-@ up areas take up around 4 % of the total area of Member States , but not all of this is actually sealed .
• Salinisation of soils results from human interventions such as inappropriate irrigation practices , use of salt @-@ rich irrigation water and / or poor drainage conditions .
Elevated salt levels in soil limit its agro @-@ ecological potential and represent a considerable ecological and socioeconomic threat to sustainable development .
Salinisation affects around 3.8 million ha in Europe .
The most affected areas are Campania in Italy and the Ebro Valley in Spain , but areas in Greece , Portugal , France and Slovakia are also affected .
• Desertification means land degradation in arid , semi @-@ arid and dry sub @-@ humid areas resulting from various factors , including climatic variations and human activities .
Droughts are also associated with or lead to an increased soil erosion risk .
Desertification is a problem in parts of the Mediterranean and central and eastern Europe .
• Soil contamination is a widespread problem in Europe .
The most frequent contaminants are heavy metals and mineral oil .
The number of sites where potentially polluting activities have taken place now stands at approximately 3 million ( a ) .

The Water Framework Directive ( WFD ) ( 11 ) is the key policy approach aimed at tackling these challenges .
It sets ecological limits to human water use and management .
For the WFD to be successful , integrated management of river basins is crucial , involving relevant stakeholders in identifying and implementing spatially @-@ differentiated measures that often involve trade @-@ offs between different interests .
The management of flood risks , in particular the relocation of dykes and reestablishment of flood plains , requires integrated urban and land @-@ use planning .
Linked yet competing issues : water @-@ energy @-@ food @-@ climate
Water makes vital contributions to economic activities including agriculture and energy production , and as a key transport route .
Climate affects both the supply and demand for energy and water , and energy conversion and water extraction processes have the potential to contribute to climate change .
At the EU and national levels , there are different sectoral and environmental policies and measures that may conflict with water management and the objective of achieving a good ecological status of water bodies .
Examples are policies for bioenergy crops and hydro @-@ energy , the promotion of irrigated agriculture , the development of tourism , and expanding inland waterway transport .
The Water Framework Directive provides options to develop integrated resource management at water basin level .

Environmental challenges in a global context
Environmental challenges in Europe and in the rest of the world are intertwined
There is a two @-@ way relationship between Europe and the rest of the world .
Europe is contributing to environmental pressures and accelerating feedbacks in other parts of the world through its dependence on fossil fuels , mining products and other imports .
Climate change is an obvious example .
Most of the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions is projected to occur outside Europe , as a result of increasing wealth in populous emerging economies .
Many of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change are

The Mediterranean - Located at the crossroad of three continents this is one of the richest ' eco @-@ regions ' and yet one of the most vulnerable natural environments in the world .
These dimensions are increasingly reflected in European neighbourhood policy priorities ( 29 ) .
Environmental challenges are closely connected with global drivers of change
A range of unfolding trends are shaping the future European and global context , and many of these are outside the realm of Europe 's direct influence .
Related global megatrends cut across social , technological , economic , political and even environment dimensions .
Key developments include changing demographic patterns or accelerating rates of urbanisation , ever faster technological changes , deepening market integration , evolving economic power shifts or the changing climate .

As such , by 2050 , the world population could thus exceed 11 billion or be limited to 8 billion ( 30
The implications of this uncertainty for global resource demands are huge .
In contrast to the global trend , European populations are expected to decline and age significantly .
In its neighbourhood , population decline is particularly dramatic in Russia and large parts of Europe .
At the same time , northern African countries along the southern Mediterranean are witnessing strong population growth .

Here , potential for ripple effects for food and energy supply
Already today , in many parts of the world , non @-@ renewable resource use is close to its limit and potentially renewable resources are being used beyond their reproductive capacity .
This kind of dynamics can also be recognised in Europe 's neighbouring regions with their comparatively rich natural capital .
Water resource over @-@ exploitation , combined with insufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation , for example , are critical challenges both in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean ( 35 ) .
At the global level , poverty and social exclusion are further exacerbated by ecosystem degradation and changes in the climate .
Globally , efforts to alleviate extreme poverty were reasonably effective until the 1990s ( 51 ) .
However , the recurring food and economic crises throughout 2006 to 2009 have magnified the trend of increasing under @-@ nourishment rates around the world .
Resource over @-@ exploitation and changes in the climate aggravate threats to natural capital .
They also affect quality of life , potentially
Furthermore , undermining social and political stability ( the livelihoods of billions of people are inevitably linked with the sustainability of local ecosystem services .

pressures (
Many key drivers operate on a global scale and are likely to unfold over decades rather than years .
In a recent assessment , the World Economic Forum warned about a higher level of systemic risk due to the increase in interconnections among various risks ( 60 ) .

Future environmental priorities : some reflections
Unprecedented change , interconnected risks and increased vulnerabilities pose new challenges
The previous chapters highlight the fact that the world is experiencing environmental change and hence new challenges on a scale , speed and interconnectedness that are unprecedented .
Decades of intensive use of stocks of natural capital and ecosystem degradation by developed countries to fuel economic development have resulted in global warming , loss of biodiversity and various negative impacts on our health .
The long @-@ term ambition of achieving 80 to 95 % reductions in CO
As in the past , future climate change impacts are expected to affect disproportionately the most vulnerable in society : children , the elderly , and the poor .
On the positive side , greater access to green
S y n the he si s iss spaces , biodiversity , clean water and air benefit people 's health .
However , this too raises the question about the sharing of access and benefits , since often spatial planning and investment decisions favour the rich at the expense of the poor .
Well @-@ maintained ecosystems and ecosystem services are essential to support climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives , and preserving biodiversity is a prerequisite for ensuring this .
As these demands increase , for example for chemical substitutes , there are likely to be increasing conflicts with existing uses for food , transport and leisure .
Sudden breakdowns in one area or geographical region can transmit large @-@ scale failures through a whole network of economies , via contagion , feedbacks and other amplifications .
The recent global financial crash or the Icelandic
volcano episodes have demonstrated this (
Crises such as these have also shown how difficult it is for society to deal with risks . Well signposted and numerous early warnings
There is no single ' quick fix ' for the challenges that Europe faces .
Rather , as this report shows , there is a clear case for long @-@ term , interconnected approaches to deal with them .
What this report also provides is evidence that existing European environmental policies present a robust basis on which to build new approaches that balance economic , social and environmental considerations .
Implementing and strengthening environmental protection provides multiple benefits
Full implementation of environmental policies in Europe remains paramount , as key targets are still to be met ( Chapter 1 ) .
However , it is clear that targets in one area can inadvertently , through unintended consequences , disrupt or counteract a target in another .
Such policies have permitted the economy to grow well beyond what might otherwise have been feasible .
For example , without tightening
There are also ancillary benefits from combined implementation of environmental legislation .
For example , combining climate change mitigation and air pollution abatement legislation could deliver benefits in the order of EUR 10 billion per year through reductions in damage to public health and ecosystems ( A ) ( 11 ) .
Environmental producer responsibility legislation ( such as REACH ( 12 ) , WEEE
) ) has contributed to push multi @-@ national companies , for example , to design production processes at global level that meet EU standards and so deliver benefits for consumers across the world .
In addition , EU legislation is often replicated in China , India , California and elsewhere , highlighting further the multiple benefits of well @-@ designed policies in the globalised economy .
European countries have also invested substantially in monitoring and regular reporting of environmental pollutants and wastes .
They are beginning to use the best available information and communication technologies and sources to develop information flows from in @-@ situ instruments to Earth observation with specialised sensors .
There are a number of information policies and processes in place or being negotiated in Europe to support swifter responses to emerging challenges .
The desire to make economic and social progress that does not come at the expense of the natural environment is not new .
Many European industries have decoupled emissions of key pollutants and the use of certain materials from economic growth .
What is new is that management of natural capital requires decoupling of economic growth not only from resource use but also from environmental impacts within Europe and globally .
Natural capital embraces many components .
It is the stock of natural resources from which ecosystems goods and services can be derived .
Using it often involves trade @-@ offs between different services and striking a balance between maintaining and using stocks .
There are three main types of natural capital ( Chapter 6 ) which require different policy measures to manage them .
In some cases , natural capital that is depleted can be substituted by other types of capital , such as non @-@ renewable energy resources that are used to develop and invest in renewable energy sources .
However , more
Since the industrial revolution there has been a shift away from using renewable resources to non @-@ renewables to fuel our economy .
Such trends make Europe vulnerable to external supply shocks that may result from an over @-@ reliance on non @-@ renewables .
Addressing this bias could be a key element in meeting the resource efficiency objective under the EU 2020 strategy ( 15 ) .
A broader argument for shifting towards long @-@ term development based on natural capital management is that today 's poor governance of natural resources is forwarding risks to future generations .
Particularly land and water resources offer viable entry points for strengthening integrated ecosystem @-@ based approaches to resource management .
The Water Framework Directive , for example , has the aim of protecting ecosystems - aquatic and terrestrial - at its core .
Approaches that recognise the multifunctional benefits of ecosystems are central to proposals for post @-@ 2010 biodiversity policies and gaining traction in the marine , maritime , agriculture and forestry sectors .
As integrated management of natural resources becomes more prominent , competing demand for resources increasingly requires trade @-@ offs .
This creates a need for accounting techniques - including , in particular , comprehensive accounting of land and water resources - that make transparent the full costs and benefits of ecosystem use and maintenance .
In addition , the identification of critical thresholds in resource use and the development of ecosystem accounts , ecosystem service indicators and ecosystem assessments are ongoing in Europe and globally .
Examples of such initiatives are The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB ) , the revision of Integrated Environmental and
More integrated actions across policy domains can help in greening the economy
Environmental policies have primarily influenced production processes and protected human health .
They therefore only partly address today 's systemic risks .
This is because many of the causes of environmental problems , such as over @-@ use of the land and oceans , are overwhelming the progress being made ( Chapter 1 ) .
Such causes often originate from multiple sources and economic activities that compete for short @-@ term benefits from resource exploitation .
S y n the he si s iss maximise benefits and avoid unintended consequences .
Examples of achieving such coherence include :
This marks a key difference compared to the situation 15 to 20 years ago and provides precedent for more effective collaboration between sectoral and environmental interests .
S y n the he si s iss gains from investments in green technologies .
For example , investment in energy efficiency and renewable energies delivers benefits to the environment , employment , energy security , energy costs , and can help combat fuel poverty .
The polluter pays principle can stimulate a greening of the economy through taxes that allow market prices to reflect full costs of production , consumption and wastes .
However , for this to happen - as known for decades , but rarely applied - prices need to reflect the true economic , environmental and social value of resources , relative to available substitutes .
Evidence of the benefits of fiscal reform has grown in recent years .
Such benefits include environmental improvements , employment gains , a stimulus to eco @-@ innovation and more efficient tax systems .
Studies show the benefits from modest environmental tax reform in several European countries that have been implemented over the last 20 years .
Similarly , they convincingly demonstrate the advantages of additional reforms designed to achieve the EU climate and resource
efficiency goals (
Accounting fully for natural capital will also require new classifications , ideally linked to existing ones as described in the statistical frameworks and system of national accounts ( SNA ) .
Important examples are emerging , for example in the area of ecosystem services ( 35 ) or carbon accounting and carbon crediting .
The challenge now is to improve the knowledge base in order to support more accountable and participatory decision making .
Providing access to information is essential for effective governance ; but engaging people in collecting data and sharing their lay knowledge is
arguably just as important (
A further reflection concerns equipping Europeans with the skills to make the transformation to a green economy .
A good example is the European recycling industry which holds a 50 % global market and has been increasing employment by some 10 % annually , mostly for unskilled workers ( 39 ) .
There is scope to foster further the role of small and medium enterprises in natural capital management .

EEA Signals are annual reports covering a broad range of topics .
They are typically built around 20 @-@ 30 pages of indicator @-@ based assessment wri � en in non @-@ technical language for a broad audience with graphics to support the text .
They are translated into all EEA languages .
The key messages in this year 's report highlight the need to make further progress in managing the environmental impacts of agriculture , transport and energy .
Similar instruments can also help deal with unsustainable trends in waste generation .
The spin @-@ off benefits for the environment and human health will be multi @-@ dimensional across issues such as climate change , air pollution , biodiversity and water quality .
The major events in Europe 's environment during 2003 were weather- and climaterelated .
The hot summer claimed possibly as many as 35 000 lives , mainly in southern Europe .
Ozone pollution levels were especially high , while unusually low water flows were recorded in the Danube , Rhine and other major rivers , in sharp contrast with the heavy flooding the summer before .
The summer 2003 forest fires claimed lives and cost some EUR 925 million in Portugal alone .
It is estimated that in Europe around three quarters of economic losses caused by catastrophic events result from weather- and climate @-@ related events .
A very conservative estimate of the annual average bill is about EUR 10 billion and rising .
These figures suggest that managing Europe 's natural resources is increasingly important for ensuring the viability of Europe 's economic and social capital .
In general , environmental data are improving but they remain inadequate to meet the task of monitoring changes .
For example , water quality data need to become more statistically representative at catchment level , while air quality monitoring for small particles ( PM
) needs strengthening in urban areas . Waste data are very
5 patchy and generally suffer from definitional problems although packaging waste is relatively well documented .
The timeliness of all data needs to be improved .
The European Environment Agency is working to improve data by ensuring there is complete coverage over time for all member countries and that data delivered are as accurate as possible .
Work continues to improve indicator methodologies , focusing primarily on the EEA core set of indicators ( www.eea.eu.int / coreset ) .
The set will be reviewed regularly and gradually expanded to cover issues not well addressed at present , such as resource use , health and chemicals .
Professor Jacqueline McGlade Executive Director
Europe 's environment should be considered in the context of socio @-@ economic agendas , such as the Lisbon process and sustainable development , that also have a strong global dimension .
In March 2000 the Lisbon European Council set a new strategic goal ( 1 ) for Europe .
The main barriers to progress in environmental protection and sustainability are the complex , inter @-@ sectoral , inter @-@ disciplinary and international nature of both the problems and the solutions .
Such solutions embrace competitiveness and innovation , social cohesion , territorial cohesion and the protection and maintenance of scarce natural resources and valuable ecosystems .
The European Union is the second largest economy behind the United States , with a vast array of assets and a lead part to play in global governance .
The Lisbon economic agenda aims to deliver higher growth and more and be � er jobs , but progress towards its objectives is mixed .
Employment growth in these Member States has also lagged behind the United States since 1990 , but labour productivity has been more closely aligned .
Competitiveness and innovation are defining conditions for growth to deliver sustainable outcomes for Europe 's economy , society and environment .
In the future , ambitious regions in the new EU Member States are expected to overtake the least competitive among the older Member States .
Norway and Switzerland also perform well .
The extent of knowledge creation and the utilisation of human capital distinguish the competitive performers from the less competitive .
Many of these countries and regions also perform relatively well on environmental issues , indicating that economic and environmental goals can be achieved together .
Reducing regional disparities , the main goal of the European Union 's cohesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � er ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Cohesion Report , February 2004 ) .
Be � er growth also means improved resource productivity .
There was a slight increase per capita in the use of materials in the European Union economy between 1980 and 2000 .
Europe leads on environmental technology innovations , for example on more sustainable manufacturing materials and processes , renewable energies and waste treatment practices .
Research is key to maintaining progress .
There is also a lot to be achieved by promoting the use of venture capital in embryo niche markets .
Social changes in Europe are being driven by enlargement , demographic changes and globalisation .
These in turn are influencing consumption pa � erns and spatial planning decisions , with transport in particular playing an increasingly pivotal role in the economy and people 's lives .
Wealth per capita differs substantially between the west and east of the European Union .
The now enlarged Union has 20 % more population and 25 % more territory .
The pressures on urban agglomerations across Europe are expected to increase further as people seek to improve their living standards by moving to where the employment opportunities are greatest .
These trends will increase pressure on existing urban infrastructure and services but will also create opportunities for building more sustainable cities that accommodate economic , social and environmental aspirations .
In this evolving context , Europe 's population is expected to increase until about 2020 , a � er which it will stabilise and then decline .
However the working @-@ age population ( those aged 15 @-@ 64 ) is expected to start falling a few years earlier , from 2010 , with consequences for sustaining employment and innovation .
In parallel , there will be a marked increase in older persons ( aged 65 and over ) .
The consumption demand pa � erns of older people tend to shi � towards services such as social and leisure activities , including tourism , with consequent environmental impacts .
So , for example , the explosive increase in air travel , which is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions , reflects in part these changes in demography .
While Europe 's population stabilises and ages , the number of households will increase at a more rapid rate .
In the European Union the number grew by 11 % between 1990 and 2000 ( 4 ) and is expected to continue rising .
The majority of new households will be small , reflecting social and lifestyle changes such as increasing numbers of single and divorced people .
Smaller households tend to be less efficient , requiring more resources per capita ( 5 ) than larger households .
The trend towards smaller households also increases the pressure on land and acts as a factor driving the expansion of built @-@ up areas .
Over 80 % of Europeans ( 6 ) are expected to live in urban areas by 2020 .
Europe 's rural population , in turn , is declining and this long @-@ observed trend is expected to continue ( 7 ) .
Rural depopulation o � en results in the abandonment of farmland , a trend that is of particular threat to areas of high nature conservation value ( 8 ) .
Semi @-@ natural and extensively farmed areas are very vulnerable to changes in land management such as the cessation of grazing and mowing , which contribute to the maintenance of high biological diversity in these areas .
Between 1995 and 2001 , energy consumption rose by 7 % while GDP increased by 16 % .
The continued potential for saving energy is widely recognised .
In the energy supply sector the opportunities for improvement focus in the short term on further switching to more efficient natural gas @-@ powered production , and in the longer term on increasing use of combined heat and power and decentralising electricity generation .

These farming practices are o � en also the most marginal and are therefore economically vulnerable to rising prices and greater competition .
The management of Europe 's environment and its natural capital are important to ensure the longterm viability of its economic and social capital .
It is estimated that in Europe around three @-@ quarters of economic losses caused by catastrophic events are weather- or climaterelated .
A very conservative estimate of the average annual bill is about EUR 10 billion and rising .
Energy consumption is still increasing , a major concern in the context of climate impacts .
In particular the domestic sector 's demand for electricity and transport are rising in line with increasing wealth and the growing number of smaller households .
End @-@ of @-@ pipe technology has reduced air pollutant emissions from power generation , but as the possibilities are narrowing for some key lowcarbon technologies , such as largescale hydro @-@ electric power , other options need to be explored .
Trends in waste generation , a proxy for resource use intensity , are unsustainable .
Treatment and disposal options are diminishing as quantities increase and concerns about their potential impacts grow .
Decisions on the location of incinerators have become very controversial in many countries .
Landfill options are o � en limited by space as well as by fears of soil and groundwater contamination and their impacts on human health .
The current policy tools for dealing with waste are inadequate and need to be complemented by approaches that promote smarter resource use by changing production and consumption pa � erns and through innovation .
Built @-@ up land area
Built @-@ up areas are spreading across Europe and increasing much faster than the population .
Most new areas have been created at the expense of agricultural land , but are also encroaching on forested land .
Built @-@ up areas have a heavy impact on soil function : where the topsoil is taken off during construction , removing the built surface would not restore the soil to a useful resource .
This has implications for soil as a resource for future generations .
( Index , 1980 = 100 )
Direct material consumption ( DMC ) is a measure of the materials used by the economy .
Non @-@ renewable materials dominate DMC : their share was fairly constant at around 75 % between 1980 and 2000 .
Of these , construction minerals make up the largest share , accounting for more than 40 % .
0 The urban population is increasing .
It is forecast that 80 % of Europeans will be living in urban areas by 2020 , and in seven countries the proportion will be 90 % or more .
The pressures of extensive urban development ( urban sprawl ) are closely coupled with issues of transport and consumption .
Urban sprawl can also lead to economic segregation , seen in areas of inner @-@ city dereliction and extensive peripheral estates , o � en with sub @-@ standard housing .
Urban expansion can also place pressure on inner city and urban green areas , which may be vulnerable to fragmentation and conversion unless adequately protected by planning guidelines .
Current rural development spending in Member States is not sufficiently targeted at biodiversity @-@ rich areas .
Europe 's countryside has been shaped by agriculture over centuries and much of Europe 's biodiversity depends in some way on farmland .
Protecting valuable farmland is important for halting the loss of biodiversity .
However , by 2003 the sites designated by
The common agricultural policy accounts for about 50 % of the total European Union budget and influences how farmers manage their land and livestock .
Past subsidies encouraged intensive agricultural production by paying per tonne of wheat or per head of livestock produced .
These help to fund the protection of high nature value farmlands , underpinning the activities of the LIFE ( Nature ) programme .
Both these trends have negative environmental consequences , especially on biodiversity .
The share of rural development measures in the common agricultural policy budget has increased since 1990 and accounted for 13 % ( equivalent to EUR 53 per hectare ) in 2000 @-@ 2002 .
In absolute terms , however , the level of rural development spending is similar .
As well as taking a higher share of the total agricultural budget it is important that rural development expenditure , and in particular the agrienvironment schemes , is properly targeted at areas of high biodiversity .
Some 30 @-@ 40 % of rural development funding is used for agrienvironment schemes but levels of spending vary widely between countries .
Spain and Greece , for example , spent around EUR 4 per hectare on agri @-@ environmental schemes in 2000 @-@ 2002 while in Finland and Austria the figure was around EUR 80 per hectare .
More than 70 % of farming area in Finland and Austria is covered by agri- environment schemes but only about 5 % in Spain and Greece .

Bird populations
Farmland bird populations have fallen substantially in recent decades .
These data start in 1980 but it is probable that rapid decline also occurred in the 1970s .
Wetland birds are migratory : their numbers o � en fluctuate in line with temperature , with fewer arriving in cold years .
Wetland birds are also affected by hunting and eutrophication of wetlands .
Time ( years )
Organic farming area
Organic farming does not use chemical fertilisers and pesticides .
It relies instead on animal manure , crop rotation and appropriate soil cultivation practices for building up soil fertility and combating pests and plant diseases .
Organic agriculture has lower yields than conventional farming systems but reduces the risk of nitrate pollution of water and generally promotes more wildlife .
Across the EEA @-@ 31 as a whole , however , organic farming area increased by around four fi � hs between 1997 and 2000 , to 4.4 million hectares from 2.4 million .

Water pollution : Managing nitrate
Diffuse pollution from agricultural land is still the main source of nitrate in water .
Nitrates continue to damage the environment , contributing to eutrophication in coastal and marine waters and pollution of drinking water , especially where groundwaters have become contaminated .
Member States ' success in tackling nitrate pollution has been mixed .
Nitrate pollution is caused mainly by agriculture .
Unless fertiliser and manure are absorbed by crops or removed during harvesting , excess nitrate can be washed into groundwater as well as surface water bodies ( 13 ) .
Measures to reduce nitrate pollution can be effective however .
The greatest improvements have occurred in Denmark , which began a national nitrogen management programme in the late 1980s .
This combines advice to farmers with the allocation of an annual nitrogen ' budget ' to each farm , enforced through regular field checks .
Substantial time lags can occur before changes in agricultural practices are reflected in groundwater quality , depending on the soil type and the specific hydrogeological conditions of the groundwater body and overlying substrate .
As groundwater ranges in age from decades to millennia ( although groundwater used for drinking water is on average 40 years old ) , current practices are in effect leaving a legacy of groundwater pollution for coming generations .
Around one third of groundwater bodies ( 14 ) now exceed nitrate guideline values .
Consumers , rather than the polluters ( i.e. farmers ) , pay almost all of the bill .
Agricultural practices are currently less intensive in the ten new EU Member States than in the 15 older ones .
However , if farming becomes more intensive in the new Member States , as predicted , nitrate concentrations in surface and ground waters could increase .
Arable land in upstream catchments
0 0 < 10 > 50 Nitrate concentrations in rivers are linked to the proportion of arable land in the upstream catchment : highest levels occur where large amounts of nitrogenous fertilisers and animal manure are used .
In 2001 , nitrate levels in rivers where arable land covers more than 50 % of the upstream catchment area were three times higher than in catchments with arable land cover of less than 10 % .

Nitrate concentrations in rivers
Nitrate pollution of groundwater appears stable at the European level .
Increases may either reflect the time @-@ lag between changes in agricultural practices and their effects on groundwater quality or show a need for additional measures .
Nature : Maximising the value of protected areas
The future of nature protection lies in integrating biodiversity considerations into sectoral and environmental policies and maximising the utility of existing protected sites .
More needs to be done to protect marine biodiversity .
Since the 1970s , the number of national sites has increased substantially as countries have progressively implemented national laws on nature protection .
International and European Union instruments have also made it compulsory for countries to designate sites for protection ( 19 ) .
As a result there are now nearly 600 different categories of protection and more than 42 000 individual protected sites in the European Environment Agency 's 31 member countries .
Additionally , marine protected areas have been created in all of the regional seas and on the coasts of many European countries .
However , there remain substantial gaps in the protection of marine and coastal areas .
Marine areas should be protected according to the richness of their biodiversity , but this protection may conflict with other uses including shipping or fishing .
Agreeing on an appropriate level of protection and then enforcing it is therefore o � en difficult .
Protected areas cannot be sustained in isolation from the communities and economic activities in and around them ( 20 ) .
To maximise their value , protected areas need to be integrated into wider landscape uses and be connected to other areas of similar qualities .
Connecting sites ensures that species have the possibility to survive by moving in response to disturbances and climate change .
The Natura 2000 network can play a role in achieving such integration .
There is now less scope for designating new sites as protecting biodiversity competes with growing and conflicting pressures on available land .
Implementation of the habitats directive
As of November 2003 , more than 80 % of the habitats and species listed in the EU habitats directive were sufficiently ( 21 ) covered by sites in r e

Fish catches above safe limits
0 Overall 60 % of European fish catches exceed safe limits , i.e. levels above which the biomass removed by fishing is no longer replaced by population growth .
Catches of open sea fish account for almost two thirds of all catches ; about half of these catches are outside safe limits .
Industrial fishing catches account for another 20 % of the total .
Fish play an integral role within the wider marine environment , which is experiencing pressures from shipping , pollution , coastal eutrophication and climate change .
The continuation of present trends of over @-@ fishing will therefore probably lead to substantial changes across the entire marine ecosystem .

Cold water species
The past decade has seen a marked change in the relative abundance of zooplankton in the North Sea .
The warm @-@ water copepod Calanus helgolandicus has become more than twice as abundant as the cold @-@ water species Calanus finmarchicus .
These data are illustrative of a general trend for zooplankton populations to shi � northwards in response to changing climatic conditions .
The composition of the marine ecosystem has been changing since the mid 1980s in the North Sea , a trend that directly affects fish populations and consequently fisheries .
Projections show that global warming will increasingly change the composition of the ecosystems in the oceans and cause a shi � by warm @-@ water species towards higher latitudes .
Packaging waste : Still increasing
Prevention has long been the highest priority of European Union waste policy : only where the production of waste is unavoidable should recycling and reuse of waste be encouraged .
Yet Europe has made li � le progress in preventing packaging waste .
While many countries have met the targets for recycling set under the 1994 packaging waste directive , the amount of packaging waste is still increasing .
Data suggest overall volumes of waste are continuing to grow in Europe .
Total waste is made up of several waste streams .
The largest is construction and demolition waste , but packaging waste is the best documented in terms of quantities produced and treated .
The generation of packaging waste is closely coupled to economic growth and consumption pa � erns .
From 1997 to 2001 the amount of packaging waste increased in 10 of the 15 older EU Member States , and by 7 % in the then European Union as a whole .
Preliminary projections suggest that volumes of packaging waste are likely to continue rising substantially in the future ( 22 ) .
Some of this increase is a � ributable to the proportionately higher generation of packaging waste from small households , but also to the growth of the internal market and the consequently greater need to transport packaged goods .
With rising emphasis on health and food safety , the amount of food packaging has also been increasing .
The European Union Packaging Waste Directive ( 94 / 62 / EC ) addresses the elements of packaging waste management in a general way while placing emphasis on recycling and recovery by se � ing quantitative targets for both .
An initial analysis ( 23 ) suggests that for some countries ( e.g. Italy and Ireland ) the directive has had a positive impact on the implementation of packaging waste management systems .
In general , countries that have implemented a mix of instruments have been most effective in meeting their objectives and targets .
The directive was amended in January 2004 but as it contains no waste prevention targets it can have only an indirect effect on the prevention of packaging waste .
The soundness of recycling as a strategy for smarter resource use has recently been questioned ( 25 ) , but recycling is in most cases be � er for the environment than either energy recovery or disposal .
As the cost of recycling rises with the percentage of material recycled however , a comparison of the costs ( including external costs ) of alternative options is likely to limit the scope for raising recycling targets continually .
Generating less waste in the first place must remain the foremost objective .
Between 1997 and 2001 total packaging waste increased by 7 % in the EU @-@ 15 .
Packaging waste quantities vary substantially between countries , most likely due to different calculation methodologies .
In particular some countries report only on the four key materials for which Member States are required to provide data - plastic , glass , metal and paper .
Others report on all packaging including wood , which substantially increases the total weight recorded .
The main forms of recovery are recycling and incineration to produce energy .
The use of incineration is high in some countries e.g. Denmark and the Netherlands , while in others , e.g. Germany and Austria , more recycling is used .
The revised directive , adopted in January 2004 , will effectively restrict the scope for incineration and other recovery methods except recycling .
In some countries this will require substantial changes to the collection and sorting of wastes .
The directive 's targets are to be met by the end of 2008 .
Several countries , in particular the New @-@ 10 , are still a long way from meeting this . Some , including Estonia , Cyprus , Lithuania , Malta , Poland and Slovakia , but also Ireland , will need to more than double the proportion they recycled in 2002 .

Sustainable energy : A long way to go
Total energy consumption continues to increase rapidly , making it difficult for Europe to reach its objectives on climate change .
If exploited more fully , energy efficiency and renewable energy sources could make a major contribution to a more sustainable energy system .
Achieving this will require deep changes throughout the economy .
Total energy consumption in the 25 Member States has been rising since the mid @-@ 1990s and this trend is expected to continue .
Burning fossil fuels , the main source of greenhouse gas emissions , is predicted to remain the largest energy source in Europe for the next 30 years .
The transition to sustainable energy will require substantial increases in energy savings , energy efficiency and renewable energy production across all sectors .
Substantial growth in renewable energy is needed to meet European and national targets for 2010 and will require further support .
Creating favourable conditions for renewables is a key requirement for increasing their market share .
Increased support for renewables will drive innovation and new technologies .
The recently proposed energy services directive ( 26 ) is another step in the right direction .
It aims to lower energy consumption by se � ing mandatory targets for Member States to save 1 % per year of energy supplied between 2006 and
This potential needs to be realised to move Europe further towards a sustainable energy future .

Transport : Full @-@ cost pricing needed
Demand for transport , especially road transport , is growing rapidly .
This increase has implications across many areas , including energy consumption , climate change and human health .
Decoupling transport demand from economic growth has been a key aim of EU transport policy for several years but has yet to show results .
Freight volumes are growing faster than the economy ( at around 3 % a year compared with 2 % , for the 15 older EU Member States ) ( 31 ) .
This largely reflects the pan @-@ European production and consumption pa � erns that are accompanying the expansion of the EU internal market .
Passenger transport is increasing at the same rate as the economy .
Air transport is growing by 6 @-@ 9 % per year in both the old and new EU Member States .
At the same time the market shares of modes such as rail and buses are increasing only marginally , if at all .
Options for managing the environmental impacts of transport include adjusting prices to account fully for its external costs and promoting innovation through improved regulation and financial incentives .
Prices are an important factor for steering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of user prices are relevant .
Regulations to deal with issues such as air pollution ( e.g. particulates ) and noise , together with investment incentives , can drive innovation towards cleaner , safer and quieter transport .
This would in turn help reduce external costs .
There is clear agreement that transport prices do not fully cover the external costs caused by transport activities , although consensus is lacking on the exact figure to be paid .
Contrary to intentions , variable charges for road freight were actually reduced between 1998 and 2001 .
The most important variable element is taxation on fuel , but fuel prices have remained within the same price range for more than 20 years .
Implementing full @-@ cost pricing could help reduce environmental impacts in the same way as regulating air pollutants has led to substantial decreases in the regulated emissions .
Transport growth and gross domestic product
There has been no success in decoupling transport demand from economic growth , either for freight or passenger transport .
At around 3 % a year , freight transport is increasing faster than gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is growing at around 2 % annually .
Passenger transport is increasing at the same rate as GDP .
The reasons are complex but largely linked to socio @-@ economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market , which is driving the rise in freight transport .
For passenger transport , the reasons include increased car use for commuting , leisure and tourism .
Ozone precursors * * * Acidifying substances * * * * ns po rt emissions of air pollutants a rT
Carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise as transport demand outstrips improvements in energy @-@ related emissions .
Further improvements will take place as even stricter regulations come into force in the coming years and as older vehicles are replaced with newer ones .
Sulphur dioxide is a different case : large reductions in road transport emissions ( 61 % ) have been offset by a similar increase in emissions from international maritime transport .
Thus in effect the exposure of people to sulphur dioxide has been reduced but not the overall emissions .
Progress with distance @-@ related charges for heavy goods vehicles on highways
United Kingdom
The value of variable charges for goods transport on roads decreased in many EU Member States between 1998 and 2001 .
In overall terms , variable charges in EU @-@ 15 fell by 7 % in this period .
This is partly a result of the protests in September 2000 by freight transport companies , farmers and fishermen against rising fuel prices .
The diesel tax is still the most important instrument in value terms .
In addition several EU countries , e.g. Germany , Austria and the UK , plan to introduce distance @-@ based charges .
These will help to reduce road transport 's net external costs to the environment .

Air pollution : Damaging health in cities
High concentrations of groundlevel ozone and fine particulates are causing human health problems in cities .
Despite reductions in emissions , much of Europe 's urban population remains exposed to concentrations of these pollutants exceeding the levels set to protect human health .
Further action is needed to bring down pollution , especially as limits and targets may be tightened in response to growing evidence of health impacts at concentrations below the current values .
32 their shared precursors (
When inhaled , both ozone and particulates have adverse effects on human health .
These include aggravation of respiratory conditions such as asthma ( from short @-@ term exposure ) and respiratory and cardiovascular illness as well as premature mortality ( from longterm exposure ) ( 33 ) .
Their effect is likely to be additive , at least in the short
These health impacts are caused by high concentrations that occur mainly in the urban areas of central , eastern and southern Europe .
For particulates , high levels occur over the whole year , while ozone is mainly a problem during the summer months .
Ozone levels were especially high during the summer heatwave of 2003 .
Some people are more vulnerable to high concentrations of ozone and fine particulates than others .
The worst effects are generally seen in children , asthmatics and the elderly , as well as those exercising outdoors .
The emission cuts achieved so far have been mainly due to the introduction of catalysts on new cars and to the implementation of the EU solvents directive , which has led to lower emissions from industrial processes .
There is now growing evidence of adverse health effects from concentrations of fine particulates and ozone at levels below the values currently set to protect health .
Discussions are under way within the framework of the EU Clean Air for Europe process ( 35 ) that may lead to present limits being reconsidered and eventually tightened .
Proposals under discussion include se � ing longterm reduction targets for 2020 for both air quality concentrations and pollutant emissions .
Technology measures , demand management options and economic instruments are also being considered .
Urban population exposure to pollution levels above EU limit values
10 µm or less ) , ozone and nitrogen dioxide .
The urban population for which exposure estimates can be made increased from 51 to 103 million people over the same period .
Data reliability has therefore increased substantially , but data between 1996 and 2001 make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on exposure trends for either ozone or particulates .

Between 1990 and 2001 emissions of groundlevel ozone precursors decreased by 30 % in the EU @-@ 15 and by 43 % in the New @-@ 10 .
Road transport is the dominant source of ozone precursors ( 39 % of total emissions ) .
Other key sources are energy use ( combustion ) and use of solvents in industry and households .
The reduction in emissions is mainly due to the introduction of catalysts on new cars ( cu � ing emissions of nitrogen oxides ) and the implementation of the EU solvents directive ( limiting emissions of non @-@ methane volatile organic compounds from industrial processes ) .
Several countries are not on track to meet their targets , making substantial emission reductions necessary .
Emissions of ozone precursors have increased in Cyprus and Turkey and fallen in Estonia , but as these countries have no targets they are not shown .

European countries ; for particulates ( PM
The climate is projected to continue changing , globally and in Europe , over the next 100 years .
Evidence is growing of climate change 's impacts on human and ecosystem health as well as economic viability .
Substantial reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases will be required to ensure that Europe meets its short @-@ term emission targets .
Adaptation measures to manage the negative impacts of climate change also need to be put into place .
Combating climate change is a key environmental priority for the European Union .
The average temperature in Europe has increased by 0.95 ° C over the past 100 years and is projected to rise by as much as a further 6.3 ° C by 2100 .
Other impacts include an increase of about ten days in the average growing season in Europe over the past 20 years .
However , projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counteracted by an increased risk of water shortage , which would harm vegetation .
These changes in growing season length may require adaptation measures and changes in agriculture and nature protection strategies .
The Kyoto Protocol has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrialised countries to 5 % below 1990 levels by the period 2008 @-@ 2012 .
A recent study confirms previous estimates that to mitigate climate change in the longer term much larger global emission reductions would be needed ( 37 ) .
Several European Union Member States have set indicative targets for substantially cu � ing their emissions .
For example , the United Kingdom and Germany have reduction targets of 60 % and 30 % ( from 1990 levels ) , to be met by 2050 and 2030 respectively .

Foreword high nature value farmland are currently lacking , however .
In the Kyiv Resolution on Biodiversity , the European environment ministers therefore agreed to identify high nature value farmland and take adequate conservation measures .
Europe 's rich cultural and natural heritage is reflected in its traditional agricultural landscapes .
High nature value farmland comprises the hot spots of biological diversity in rural areas and is o � en characteristic of extensive farming practices .
As a contribution to this process , EEA and UNEP have commissioned a study on agriculture and biodiversity and a study to quantify and delineate high nature value farmland areas .
The outcome is this joint report , in which preliminary data on the distribution and conservation status of high nature value farmland and the current targeting of policy instruments are presented .
Over the last few decades , however , biodiversity on farmland has declined seriously .
Large scale rationalisation and intensification of agricultural production has taken its toll .
Many marginal and extensively farmed areas were either improved or abandoned , thus considerably reducing habitat and species diversity .
Seminatural vegetation has declined rapidly and roughly two thirds of the currently endangered bird species depend on agricultural habitats .
We sincerely hope that this joint report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to elaborate and refine the high nature value farmland concept , and further focus their conservation efforts .
In the sixth environment action programme , the EU has commi � ed itself to halt biodiversity decline by 2010 .
Conserving high nature value farmland is key to achieving this target .
PanEuropean data on distribution and conservation status of
Traditional agricultural systems have shaped the European landscape and created habitats for a wide range of species , many of which are of particular conservation concern .
High nature value farmland comprises hot spots of biodiversity in rural areas and is usually characterised by extensive farming practices .
Its conservation value is acknowledged in several EU policy documents such as the EU Regulation on rural development ( EC 1257 / 1999 ) .
Distribution and conservation status of high nature value farmland , however , has not yet been assessed at the panEuropean level .
and alpine pastures and meadows . Agriculture in these areas is usually extensive and vulnerable to change .
High nature value farmland areas are generally under severe pressure due to a vulnerable economy and depopulation .
Predominant agricultural trends are intensification on the one hand and land abandonment on the other .
Both are considered detrimental to biodiversity .
Policy responses in the EU include site protection under the habitats and bird directives and environment measures under the common agricultural policy .
The Natura 2000 sites , as proposed by the Member States , cover less than one third of high nature value farmland area .
Their conservation status is again largely unknown .
A monitoring system is under development but not yet operational .
The target is to cover ' a substantial proportion ' of such areas with rural development and agrienvironment measures by 2008 . A high nature value farmland indicator is currently under preparation within the framework of IRENA1 .
This joint report highlights the preliminary results of this indicator and analyses the current targeting of high nature value farmland by policy measures .
According to our preliminary estimates , roughly 15 @-@ 25 % of the European countryside qualifies as high nature value farmland .
The largest areas are found in eastern and southern Europe .
They consist of habitats such as seminatural grasslands , dehesas , montados and steppe areas .
High nature value farmland is also relatively abundant in mountainous regions .
Examples are grazed uplands in the United Kingdom
Joint project between DG Agriculture , DG JRC , DG Environment , Eurostat and EEA , operationalising the agrienvironment indicators mentioned in COM ( 2000 ) 20 and COM ( 2001 ) 144 .
Current policy measures appear insufficient to prevent further decline in high nature value farmland areas and thus to reach the 2010 biodiversity target .
The geographical targeting of agriculture subsidies , especially of less favoured area support and agrienvironment schemes , needs to be reconsidered .
It should be kept in mind , though , that the current data do not allow for detailed geographical analysis .
A major effort is needed to fill the data gaps on habitat and species distribution and the targeting and effectiveness of support measures .
What is high nature value farmland and why is it important ?
inputs , use of machinery and overall productivity ) ( see Figure 2 ) .
The most intensive arable and grassland systems are virtually monocultures .
Despite their low intrinsic biodiversity , however , they may still provide wintering grounds for migratory waterfowl .
Europe is famous for its unique rural landscapes that represent a rich cultural and natural heritage .
Regionally differing farming practices have led to a variety of agricultural habitats that host a large number of plant and animal species .
The biodiversity of farmland , however , has rapidly declined across Europe in the last few decades , as illustrated here for common birds of the countryside ( Figure 1 , see also Donald et al . , 2001 ) .
Population trend common birds
Highest biodiversity coincides with low agricultural inputs .
Although extensive mixed arable systems may also support high biodiversity , the majority of high nature value farmland consists of seminatural grasslands .
They are the true hot spots for biodiversity .
( 1993 , 1995 ) described the general characteristics of low @-@ input farming systems in terms of biodiversity and management practices and introduced the term high nature value farmland .
Most of these farming systems are characterised by low stocking densities , low use of chemical inputs and o � en labour intensive management practices , such as shepherding .
Biodiversity generally decreases when the intensity of farming increases ( in terms of nutrient and pesticide

Unfortunately , until now high nature value farmland has been only loosely defined .
A lack of distribution and monitoring data has prevented insight into the targeting and effectiveness of policy measures .

Trends in high nature value farmland the use of nitrogenous fertilisers ( Figure 5 ) .
High nature value farmland is threatened by two contrasting trends : intensification and abandonment .
Fertiliser use in western Europe appears generally to have levelled off .
Intensification
Environmental pressures are expected to decrease somewhat in western Europe , whilst many areas in central and eastern Europe will experience increasing agricultural intensity .
This means that some of the high nature value farmland will probably be exposed to intensification in the near future .
Where natural and economic conditions allow , farming will intensify in order to increase yields and overall efficiency .
This has been a continuous process in most parts of western Europe for decades , reflected in a steady increase in fertiliser inputs and milk and cereal yields .
In eastern Europe investment in the agricultural sector has dropped substantially due to the political and economical changes during the 1990s .
This is reflected in the sudden drop in
N @-@ fertiliser consumption in selected central and eastern European countries * and the EU kg / ha 80
The socio @-@ economic conditions in rural areas with extensive agriculture are generally unfavourable .
The proportion of the elderly is already very high amongst farmers .
As a result , land abandonment is to be expected ( Heilig 2002a , b ) .
0 Land abandonment is already a common phenomenon in regions where agricultural productivity is relatively low ( Baldock et al . , 1996 ) .
The situation is particularly worrying in central and eastern Europe , where political and economic change has negatively affected the conditions for farming ( EEA , 2004 ) .
Similar data sets for other countries are rare , since land abandonment is not easily detected in general agricultural statistics .

Impacts on nature value
The black grouse Tetrao tetrix occurs on grazed heaths and moorland , and is showing a rapid and almost Europewide decline ( Tucker and Heath , 1994 ) .
Upland habitats in the United Kingdom suffer from overgrazing and afforestation , causing moderate population decline .
In lowland western Europe , this once rather common species is now practically extinct because of habitat destruction and agricultural intensification .
In the Netherlands , for example , black grouse numbers fell from several thousands in the 1950s to less than 100 today ( see Niewold , 1990 ) .
Loss of extensive grassland habitat is reflected by the large @-@ scale decline of the corncrake Crex crex .
Its numbers have fallen by more than 50 % in 10 countries .
Drainage of wet grasslands , intensification and the conversion of hay meadows into silage grasslands are the main causes ( Tucker and Heath , 1994 ) .
The corncrake is most common in central and eastern Europe , but habitat loss and population decline also occurs
Loss of seminatural vegetations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends . Although many case studies exist ( see for example Veen and Seffer , 1999 ) , no reliable panEuropean trend data are currently available for plant communities and habitats .
The best data available are for birds .
Farmland birds are indicative of overall biodiversity , since they depend on a variety of plant and animal food and diverse vegetation structures for feeding , nesting and
The relatively small number of priority species in northern Europe does not necessarily reflect low nature value or absence of conservation problems , since species richness generally decreases with latitude .

In Hungary , the great bustard population dropped from 2 500 individuals in 1985 to 1 100 individuals in 1990 ( Fésüs et al . , 1992 ) .
Reasons for this are intensified agricultural use of meadows and pastures , as well as increasing cultivation of maize and sunflowers .
In the 1990s the Hungarian great bustard population was stable ( Faragó , 2003 ) .

Policy responses
They are either aimed at obligatory site protection or based on voluntary measures in the wider countryside .
Annex I of the habitats directive lists natural and seminatural habitat types that must be maintained in a favourable conservation status by the Member States .
The Natura 2000 network will build on the proposed sites of communal interest ( pSCIs 5 ) that have been listed by the Member States .
Out of the 198 habitat types listed in Annex I of the habitats directive , 28 require extensive agricultural management and can be regarded as high nature value farmland .
Site protection
The main policy instruments for site protection at EU level are the birds
Figure 8 gives an overview of the share of these agricultural habitat types within the Natura 2000 network .
The pa � ern is rather consistent with the distribution

5 The pSCIs have to be further designated as Special Area of Conservation ( SAC ) .
High nature value farmland : Characteristics , trends and policy challenges of high nature value farmland ( compare with Figure 4 ) .
The average share of extensive agricultural habitats within pSCIs is 15 % , even exceeding 50 % in parts of Spain and the United Kingdom ( see Figure 8 ) .
This underlines their conservation value .
The second pillar of the CAP allows Member States to implement measures for alleviating or improving the ecological impacts of agriculture .
There is an array of measures that can be used to support environmentally friendly farming systems .
However , the main elements relevant to high nature value farmland conservation are agrienvironment schemes and less favoured area payments6 .
The following sections will analyse the geographical targeting of these policy measures .
Agrienvironment schemes
Nonetheless , less than one third of the high nature value farmland areas is covered by pSCIs ( see Appendix B ) .
Currently , there are no good monitoring data available about trends within the Natura 2000 sites .
All in all , it can be concluded that the site protection measures will at best conserve a minority of high nature value farmland .
Under the current rural development regulation , adopted in 20037 , Member States are obliged to put agrienvironment schemes in place .
Support can be granted to farmers for environmentally favourable measures , including conservation of high nature value farmed environments which are under threat .
The CAP is composed of two ' pillars ' .
The regulation is flexible , allowing Member States to design tailor @-@ made schemes for regional environmental issues .
As a consequence , agrienvironmental schemes are highly variable and generally not targeted at distinct geographical areas on the basis of commonly agreed criteria .
Figure 9 shows the coverage of agrienvironment schemes in the EU Member States .
The level of implementation of agrienvironment schemes in the different countries varies considerably .
The first pillar is a commodity @-@ based regime .
Originally it was a market intervention mechanism , providing price guarantees , production incentives and export subsidies for certain crops and livestock products .
As such it was a catalyst of agricultural productivity .
Through successive reforms , the first pillar subsidies have become more and more decoupled from production .
Subsidies are now provided through direct payments on the basis of historic production levels .
Since the 2003 CAP reform , first pillar payments are subject to environmental conditions .
The reformed first pillar regime is less damaging to the environment , especially when providing incentives for farming in marginal areas ( Hellegers and Godeschalk , 1998 ) .
In general , there is no clear relationship between the overall agrienvironment expenditure per hectare and the share of high nature value farmland ( Figure 10 , see Appendix B for
Share of utilised agricultural area under agrienvironment schemes ( 1998 figures )

High nature value farmland : Characteristics , trends and policy challenges value farmland , provided that they do not create incentives for intensification and particularly overgrazing .
The receipt of less favoured area support requires compliance with good farming practice as defined by Member States .
In addition , there are ceilings on stocking densities in many regions , but these are o � en set at a level that is too high from a conservation point of view .
For example , in France ceilings of 1.8 livestock units per hectare apply in mountainous less favoured areas ( Baldock and Benne � , 2002 ) .
details ) . Countries with large areas of high nature value farmland , such as Spain , have small budgets per hectare for agrienvironment schemes .
Although no precise data are available on geographical spending pa � erns within countries , the targeting of agrienvironment measures at a European level seems far from optimal from a biodiversity conservation perspective .
Furthermore , recent research shows that current agrienvironment schemes aimed at biodiversity are not necessarily effective and that their monitoring is mostly insufficient ( Klein and Sutherland , 2003 ) .
Less favoured areas
Member States have considerable discretion both in the level of expenditure they commit and in the precise design of the less favoured area support payments .
Figure 11 shows the distribution of designated less favoured areas .
They cover more than half the utilised agricultural area in the EU , including all the higher and more mountainous ground .
Some high nature value farmland is within the more productive areas outside less favoured areas , such as saltmarshes , wet grasslands and hay meadows .
However , the great majority falls within the less favoured areas ( compare with Figure 4 ) .
Farmers in less favoured areas are eligible for payments per hectare in addition to conventional CAP support .
These compensatory payments have a combination of social and environmental objectives and are part of the second pillar of the CAP .
They will generally increase profitability of farming in marginal areas under natural constraints .
As such they are potentially an effective tool for preventing abandonment of high nature

• High nature value farmland has been widely recognised as a valuable asset of the European countryside , providing habitat for a wide range of species .
Maintaining a good conservation status is key to reaching the 2010 target of halting the loss of biodiversity .
• Outside protected areas , conservation of high nature value farmland depends mainly on the application of instruments within the common agricultural policy , notably less favoured area support and agrienvironment schemes .
These instruments , however , do not appear to be well targeted at high nature value farmland areas .
Southern European high nature value farmland areas in particular get relatively li � le support .
• High nature value farmland makes up about 15 @-@ 25 % of the utilised agricultural area in Europe .
It is unevenly distributed , with concentrations in peripheral parts of Europe .
• Overall , the 2010 biodiversity target is unlikely to be reached without additional policy efforts with regard to the conservation of high nature value farmland .
• The conservation status of high nature value farmland is insufficiently known , but case studies indicate serious biodiversity decline .
The main threats are intensification and abandonment .
• Site protection under the birds and habitats directives is an appropriate but insufficient conservation tool .
At best about one third of the high nature value farmland area will benefit from this measure .
Appendix A : High nature value farmland definition
The high nature value farmland indicator cf . Andersen ( 2003 ) distinguishes the following types of high nature value farmland :
Both maximum and minimum estimates were made .
In the maximum estimate all land cover classes with potential high nature value farmland were included .
In the minimum estimate only those land cover classes were included that have the highest probability of containing high nature value farmland .
The map in Figure 4 is based on the minimum estimate .
Farm system approach
The farm system classification builds on production , input and management characteristics and distinguishes the following main types :
• high nature value cropping systems : low intensity arable systems .
Might have livestock , but this is not the dominant income source ;
Type 1 and Type 2 areas are identified on the basis of land cover data ( Corine database ) and agronomic and economic farm @-@ level data ( FADN ) .
Combined , these two approaches give information on distribution and farming characteristics .
Due to data limitations this was possible for breeding birds only ( see Andersen , 2003 , for details on species selection and aggregation method ) .
It is not possible at this stage to merge fully the different results into one map , or to produce separate maps for the different high nature value farmland types .
• high nature value off @-@ farm grazing systems : systems with ca � le , sheep or goats grazing outside the farm , for example on common land ;
• high nature value permanent grassland systems : ca � le , sheep or goat systems where the main forage resource is grass from permanent or rough grassland ;
Each of these approaches has its strengths and weaknesses .
The species approach suffers from data gaps and should be regarded as an additional information source rather than a tool for delineating high nature value farmland .
high nature value arable grazing livestock systems : ca � le , sheep or goat systems where the main forage resource is arable crops ;
concern were identified according to their global and European status , and the proportion of their total of their world population occurring in Europe ( Tucker , 1997 , see Table A3 ) .
The SPEC designation has become accepted as highlighting bird species of especially high conservation concern .
Analogous to the land cover approach , the farm system classification was differentiated in a minimum and maximum variant .
For the calculations in this joint report only the minimum figures were used ( see also Table A2 and Figure A1 ) .
Species approach
A total of 102 species were chosen for inclusion in the analyses .
This list included all category 1 @-@ 3 species which were considered to be potentially associated with farmland throughout Europe ( see Andersen , 2003 , and Tucker , 1997 for details ) .
A cumulative distribution map was then drawn up on the basis of the EBCC Atlas of European Breeding Birds ( Hagemeijer and Blair , 1997 ) .

This is a conceptual graph , not directly derived from empirical data .
Hence the axes do not mention concrete variables .
However , empirical data that support this general relationship between agricultural intensity and biodiversity do exist .
( 1995 ) presented a rather similar graph of the relationship between plant diversity and productivity , based on vegetation research by Peeters et al . ( 1993 ) .
A second implication of the graph in Figure 2 is that biodiversity may gain from abandonment in intensive systems .
This is consistent with the success of nature development in the Netherlands on former intensive agricultural land ( LNV , 2000 ; RIVM , 2001 ) .
Of course , the depicted relationship is simplified and scale dependent .
Instead of generally reducing inputs for increasing plant diversity , one might take smallscale measures in intensive farming systems , such as leaving cereal headlands unsprayed .
This can be effective for increasing the abundance of wildlife , such as weeds , insects and gamebirds ( Boatman and Wilson , 1988 ) .
The more critical species , however , will not benefit .
This is why conservation strategies should ideally be geographically differentiated and geared to local circumstances .
Figure 4The map in Figure 4 is based on the minimum Corine estimate ( see Appendix A for details ) .
There is a need for future revisions on the basis of updated and more detailed data , and for refinements on the basis of national datasets .
Due to the limitations of the Corine land cover data , Type 2 high nature value farmland tends to be underrepresented in the minimum estimate ( for example bocage landscapes in France ) .
Type 3 farmland is also only partially included .
Intensively used grassland may be important as wintering grounds for waterfowl but these areas , mainly concentrated in lowland western Europe , do not show up on the map in Figure 4 .
Land cover data do not indicate local pressures such as overgrazing .
For Finland and Sweden , the distribution pa � ern of potential high nature value farmland is also optimistic due to interpretation
Figure 8Figure 8 was drawn up within the IRENA indicator project and builds on data from the Natura 2000 database of the European Topic Centre for Nature Protection and Biodiversity , Paris ( see also Table B1 ) .
Figure 9An update for 2001 is available , but these figures include agrienvironment schemes under Regulation 2078 / 92 and Regulation 1257 / 99 .
The data show an overlap in the area covered and hence include double counting .
For this reason the 1998 figures were used .
Figure 10 / 12The share of high nature value farmland of the utilised agricultural area was calculated as the mean of the estimates on the basis of the land cover ( Corine ) and farm system ( FADN ) approaches .
The estimates of UAA are according to Eurostat 2000 figures .
The official UAA figure for Greece is a gross underestimate of total farmland , since the commons are not included in the statistics .
Expenditure figures per hectare could therefore not be used here , and for this reason Greece was excluded from the calculations .

The ' Environment for Europe ' process now brings together 56 countries across three continents to jointly address environmental challenges .
In support of this process , the European Environment Agency has prepared a series of assessments of the environment for the pan @-@ European region to provide policy @-@ relevant , up @-@ to @-@ date and reliable information on the interactions between the environment and society .
The irst comprehensive assessment of the state of the pan @-@ European environment was presented in Soia in 1995 .
Updated assessments were presented at the Ministerial Conferences in Aarhus in 1998 and Kiev in 2003 .
This is the fourth report in the series .
The report has been prepared in close partnership with a range of international organisations , governmental institutions and non @-@ governmental organisations across the region .
Despite noteworthy progress in promoting environmental policy and sustainable development across the pan @-@ European region , an ' implementation gap ' in the use of integrated policy approaches remains .

Successful implementation depends on the setting of clear and realistic targets together with mechanisms to monitor progress .
Environmental information across the region still varies in quality , with the availability and reliability of data differing considerably .
There is substantial room for further improvement in making much @-@ needed data and information not only accessible , but also more comparable and reliable .
The pan @-@ European region harbours rich cultural and environmental diversity .
This is in stark contrast to the relatively sparse populations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia , where the average density is well below 20 people per square kilometre .
Economic recovery in recent years has resulted in an increase , in relative terms , of national income in virtually all countries of the pan @-@ European region .
Economic growth rates have been particularly high in South Eastern Europe ( SEE ) and EECCA countries .

Increasingly , the economies of EECCA countries are moving away from reliance on agricultural output towards service industries .
Nonetheless , the EECCA region is still relatively more dependent on mineral extraction and agriculture , often resulting in major environmental pressures and high volumes of wastes .
The number of independent states in the region has increased from 33 in 1990 to 53 in 2007 , during which time the EU expanded from 15 to 27 Member States .
Environment and health : Air quality
In EECCA the poor quality of the data precludes an in @-@ depth assessment of air quality and its consequences .
However , the limited data available indicates that the main health threat in EECCA and SEE is , as in WCE , from small particles and their toxic constituents .

Environment and health : Soil
Since the Kiev Conference , progress has been made both in policy development and in the availability of information .
However , it is still too early to record any marked improvement in the status of soil resources .
Given the complexity of current risks , especially climate change , new thinking on mechanisms to improve the evidence base to support action on soils is needed .
The exchange of best practices between countries and regions with similar soil conditions could reduce remediation costs across many soil threats , and provide an important basis for cooperation .

Environment and health : Hazardous chemicals
The chemical industry has been growing worldwide .
In the European Union the production of toxic chemicals has increased at almost the same rate as total chemical production , and both have grown faster than GDP .
Globalisation is resulting in a shift of environmental burdens to developing countries and the re @-@ import of hazards via transboundary pollution and contaminated products .
Recently , signiicant new policies and legislation addressing the management of chemicals have been agreed upon , both in Europe and globally . For the EU , this includes the legislation on Registrati on ,
Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals ( REACH ) , which entered into force in 2007 .
At the international level , the Strategic Approach to International Chemical Management ( SAICM ) was adopted in 2006 .
Emissions of greenhouse gases have increased in recent years in most European countries and are projected to continue to do so in the future .
Many European countries have adopted national programmes to reduce emissions , but some of them will still have dificulties in reaching their Kyoto targets .
The Kyoto Protocol , under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , and its irst commitment period represent only a irst step in addressing climate change .

Some unavoidable climate change impacts are projected to affect most sectors of the economy and natural resources - even with strong mitigation programmes .
It is therefore also urgent to adapt to those impacts in developing and implementing policies and measures in all sectors of society .
Biodiversity decline and loss of ecosystem services continue to be a major concern across the pan @-@ European region .
In addition , the number of invasive alien species in the region continues to increase .
The Kiev Resolution 's overarching target of haltingbiodiversity loss in the region by 2010 will not beachieved without considerable additional efforts and resources .
Communication , education and public awareness programmes , however , are being implemented according to the Kiev Resolution .

Environmental concerns are becoming increasingly integrated into the forestry and agricultural sectors .
Nonetheless , agriculture still exerts considerable pressure on biodiversity .
Marine and coastal environment
Eutrophication remains a problem in all enclosed seas and sheltered marine waters across the pan @-@ European region .
Reducing diffuse nutrient sources , particularly from agriculture , remains a major challenge and requires increased action .
Overishing is still widespread in all pan ‑ European seas .
Improved policies and stricter law enforcement are needed for ish stock recovery - especially to stop illegal ishing , but also to reduce the impacts of isheries on the whole marine ecosystem .

Climate change is likely to affect seas and coasts , including marine organisms .
Adaptation policies should include measures to reduce other , non @-@ climatic pressures in order to increase the resilience of marine ecosystems and the coastal zone to climate change .
Actions under regional sea conventions and EU policies have improved water quality in the western seas , for example with regard to some hazardous substances .
Policies geared towards improving the generally poor state of Europe 's marine and coastal environment should be based on an ecosystem approach .
Sustainable consumption and production
The concept of sustainable consumption and production has become more prominent on the policy agenda since the Kiev Conference .
However , few concrete outcomes have emerged , and implementation strategies and tools to measure environmental impacts need to be put in place .
Per capita resource use levels have remained stable in all regions over recent years , and some decoupling has been achieved between resource use and economic growth .
Patterns of consumption are changing rapidly , driven by socio @-@ economic changes .
The consumption categories causing the highest life @-@ cycle environmental impacts are food and beverages , private transport , and housing .
In the EU , tourism and air travel are emerging as key areas of future impacts .
The pan @-@ European region is generating ever more waste .
Landill , environmentally the least preferred option , is still the most common method of waste management across the pan ‑ European region .
EU Member States have made some progress in limiting the share of municipal waste going to landill .
Many EECCA and SEE countries have developed waste strategies and legislation for waste , but these still need to be implemented effectively .
Source : Figure 6.20 of The fourth assessment .
Proper waste collection and safe landilling remain a challenge .
In some EECCA countries an even bigger challenge is ensuring the environmental safety and clean @-@ up of hazardous waste sites inherited from the past .
Modern , intensive agriculture often has a negative impact through its use and pollution of air , water and soil .
On the other hand , farming still plays a positive role in preserving Europe 's landscapes and biodiversity .
The area of irrigated land in the southern EU ‑ 15 and SEE has increased , showing a continuing trend of agricultural intensiication .
Irrigation has ofte n caused declines in water resources and quality , salinisation and land degradation - especially in southern and eastern EECCA .
Most of SEE and EECCA will require continued international support to achieve better environmental management of the agricultural sector .

Developing competitive urban transport solutions is away of ighting trafic congestion and air quality problems as well as improving transport safety .
For public transport to become competitive , cities need to be planned and developed with public transport in mind .

The EEA strategy 2009 @-@ 2013 is the fourth Multi @-@ annual Work Programme of the Agency ; it was adopted by the EEA Management Board through written procedure following its 52nd meeting on 26 November 2008 .
EEA Strategy 2009 @-@ 2013 - Multi @-@ annual Work Programme
To become recognised as the world 's leading body for the provision of timely , relevant and accessible European enviromental data , information , knowledge and assessments .
Chairman of the EEA Management Board
Integrated environmental assessments and anticipating new thinking , especially about ecosystem services , eco @-@ efficiency and emerging technologies and innovations will play a key role in shaping European environmental policies .
Well designed environmental policies are necessary and positive for our society and economy .
The EEA will continue to work closely with neighbouring countries , in particular the West Balkan region .
It also illustrated that for successful implementation of environmental policies we need to engage at a global and regional level with all actors .
Over the last few years environment policy questions have again moved up the political agenda , which is lasting proof of the EEA 's work , and that its contribution is now more relevant than ever .
The EEA is well placed to further develop its role as a provider of independent and assured environmental information .
In addition , and looking to the next five years , I would like to highlight some of the EEA 's strategic issues .
This new Strategy will continue to support the aims of the Environment Action Programmes of the EU .
Thus climate change , nature and biodiversity , environment and health as well as natural resources and waste will continue to be at the at the centre of the work of the EEA .
The new Strategy will also take forward the Shared Environmental Information System ( SEIS ) .
Chairman of the EEA Scientific Committee
The 5 @-@ year State of Environment reports and the pan @-@ European assessments produced by the Agency have helped shape the priorities of the research framework programmes .
The context in which the EEA works is fast evolving .
It is therefore important to grasp the opportunities afforded by new developments , such as GMES and other large scale observation initiatives .
These are likely to modify profoundly the way in which data , information and indicators are provided .
The Agency covers a wide environmental agenda and keeps a close eye on emerging trends .
It also has a key role to play in ensuring the appropriate connection between discussions taking place in scientific and political arenas .
The newly elected Chairman of the EEA Scientific Committee is Dr Detlef Sprinz .
The Scientific Committee welcomes the new EEA Multi @-@ annual Work Programme for the period 2009 @-@ 2013 as a comprehensive and well @-@ balanced document .
This interdisciplinary approach is placed at the heart of the programme through a number of cross @-@ cutting themes and integrated environmental assessments the Agency will undertake .
The EEA Executive Director affected by exposure to high levels of ozone and particulate matter is growing as urban areas expand .
Access to near @-@ real @-@ time ozone data is now possible via the EEA 's Ozone web , and is being introduced to doctors and hospitals to provide an alerting system for vulnerable individuals .
New ways of identifying emerging environmental problems
This EEA Strategy outlines our plans for the next five years .
It is shaped around today 's and tomorrow 's information needs with an overall emphasis on a much wider use of the environmental information that is being collected .
We are streamlining our activities , creating new ways of working , and developing new methods to bring environmental thinking into the mainstream of economic and social policy @-@ making .
New ways of interpreting environmental information
Anticipating the types of information that policy @-@ makers , industry and citizens will need to make decisions in the future is extremely important .
Through our newly formatted publication Signals , we will bring to the attention of our readers those issues that we consider likely to weigh heavily on the agenda for the coming year .
Typical examples where the EEA worked in advance of public demand are agrofuels , energy subsidies , the valuation of ecosystem services and electro @-@ magnetic radiation .
Our work is based on the precautionary principle , evaluation of the burden of evidence , decision @-@ making under varying degrees of uncertainty and the use of decision @-@ support models and scenarios .
Over the next five years we will create a simple calculus to allow us to anticipate the potential environmental impacts arising from today 's and tomorrow 's social and economic drivers .
New ways of working
At the EEA , we will be building the equivalent of official statistics for ecological services and environmental assets ; to set alongside the traditional assets of our economy .
In the future we will be able to demonstrate how companies and governments can embed ecosystem services to restructure the global economy .
New ways of using environmental information
People need up @-@ to @-@ date information on their environment . For example , the number of people
As more and more people become convinced about the importance of the environment in their lives , the demand for reliable local information has grown explosively .
Providing information through the EEA 's networks has been a unique and positive experience .
Using up @-@ to @-@ date technologies and software , we have been able to capitalise on the scientific advances in monitoring and observation .
more quickly than any well @-@ designed sampling programme .
Combining these sources of evidence within the formal world of assessment and analysis will become very important .
The EEA has been extending and building its networks and sources for observing and knowledge @-@ gathering through its global citizen environment observatory .
Our goal
We aim to achieve this over the next five years by :
• continuing to support implementation of Europe 's environmental legislation through analyses and assessments of Europe 's environment ;
• ensuring continuous access to high quality environmental data , information and services ;
Today , the majority of Europeans agree that the environment has a significant impact on their quality of life and that global trends play a significant part in this .
Businesses are also seeking greater innovation and eco @-@ efficiency to achieve higher environmental standards and maintain their competitiveness in the economy .
• producing integrated environmental assessments and forward studies for Europe increasingly in the global context ;
• addressing critical environmental priorities as they arise on the policy agenda ;
• improving communications and dissemination to decision @-@ makers and citizens via multi @-@ media , user @-@ friendly , multilingual information .
Many of these improvements have been delivered through implementation of the environmental acquis communautaire .
At the same time , citizens remain concerned about climate change , the quality of air they breathe , how to deal with waste and the impacts of chemicals .
They have many questions about what is happening to the environment and how it will affect them and future generations .
Our strategy for 2009 @-@ 2013
Our new strategy is built on three main activities :
• continuing to support the information needs set down in EU and international environmental legislation and especially its 6th Environment Action Programme ;
The last few years have seen a growing awareness of environmental change and the need for urgent policy action .
This in turn has led to an explosive growth of environmental initiatives and institutions .
• improving the coordination and dissemination of environmental data and knowledge across Europe .
This strategy document describes the EEA 's activities under four areas :
The EEA 2009 @-@ 2013 Strategy is the fourth Multi @-@ annual Work Programme .
It builds upon the successful delivery of our previous strategy for 2004 @-@ 2008 , which was based on the key priorities of the 6th Environment Action Programme and established the Agency as a key provider in Europe of environmental data , information and knowledge .
• Integrated environmental assessment
• Information services and communications .
The 2008 effectiveness evaluation of the EEA stated that ' The Agency is ... the most efficient way to deliver the products and services required by the stakeholders . ...
It is difficult to see ... how the provision of impartial and reliable information , could be performed through any of the possible other mechanisms available for European organisations ' .
The 2008 evaluation also gave a number of recommendations on priority setting and dissemination .
These have been acted on in defining the future priorities and shape of Agency 's resources .
Our strategic objectives are to :
• play a key role in the development and implementation of European environment policies and related areas , especially the European Commission 's Environment Action Programme ;
• monitor the effectiveness of environmental policies of EU and member countries of the EEA and in candidate and potential candidate countries ;
• support the monitoring of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy ( through assistance for the Sustainable Development Indicators ) focusing on core environmentrelated issues ;
• anticipate new ideas and thinking , especially about ecosystem services , resource use and emerging technologies and innovations and behavioural changes ;
• develop new web @-@ based services for environmental educational needs ;
• help ensure , through effective communications and information services , that environmental thinking is brought into the mainstream of decision @-@ making and the daily lives of European citizens .
Our key actions for 2009 @-@ 2013
In 2011 we will ... • support environmental reporting within the European Neighbourhood Policy ; • complete a cost of inaction related valuation of damage to ecosystems services and human welfare .
In 2012 we will ... • produce an assessment of Europe 's ecosystem services - Eureca 2012 ; • support the EU @-@ wide review of the status of water and groundwater environments through WISE .
In 2013 we will ... • support the review of the environmental outcomes of the 6th Environment Action Programme and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy .
Our networks and governance
Eionet is widely acknowledged for its support of multiple forms of cooperation and a positive example of institutional and technical partnership .
The EEA is governed by a Management Board made up of its member countries , and representatives from the European Parliament and the European Commission .
The Bureau is made up of the Chair and Vice Chairs of the Management Board .
Each member country has a management board member supported by a national focal point and a number of national reference centres and principal contact points .
The EEA has a Scientific Committee , made up of independent experts from the field of environment , including social scientists and sectoral specialists .
The Committee offers advice to EEA staff and gives opinions on different issues .
Eionet - the European environment information and observing network , covering 39 member and cooperating countries - is the unique partnership between the EEA and its member countries and is central to the EEA 's networking activities .
In all there are nearly 400 people involved in Eionet .
We will undertake this area of work through the strategic area :
• EEA governance and partnerships .
National focal points
Making it happen
The EEA draws its staff from across the 32 member countries .
It also has a number of national experts .
We aim to maximise the agency 's resources for our environmental work by :
• achieving our EMAS environmental goals every year ;
• reorganising to make the Agency more responsive and flexible ;
The topic centres are distributed across the EEA member countries .
• avoiding duplication with other EU institutions ;
• liaising with staff across the European Commission on our thematic work and to ensure administrative consistency ;
• making best use of all European funded environmental actions ;
The Environmental Data Centres include climate change , water , air , biodiversity , and land use ( managed by EEA ) , forests and soils ( managed by JRC ) and waste , natural resources and products ( managed by Eurostat ) .
• continuing to maximise staff availability and efficiency by focusing on health and wellbeing .
Our Making it happen activities will be carried through the strategic area :
• EEA internal management and administration .
In the Agency we strive to give value for money across an enormous environmental agenda .
This is essential in today 's climate of increased financial pressure and the growing number of organisations working on environmental issues .

Environmental themes
General objectives for 2009 @-@ 2013
To support policy development and evaluation within the environmental themes covered by the acquis communautaire and related areas by :
• ensuring full access , via SEIS and the EEA Environmental Data Centres , to the qualityassured data needed to support European @-@ level work on indicators and integrated assessments ;
• maintaining and developing relevant EEA indicators within the Indicator Management System ;
One of the fundamental roles of the EEA is to support EU environmental policy by tracking and reporting on the outcomes of the implementation of EU environmental legislation across all EEA member countries .
• carrying out evaluations of the existing effectiveness of policies and outlooks for the future in the 2020 @-@ 2030 perspective .
The work is divided into major environmental themes in line with those under the European Commission 's 6th Environment Action Programme :
• Air quality • Air pollutant emissions • Biodiversity • Greenhouse gas emissions • Freshwater • Marine
The demand for work of this type is expected to continue and develop over the next five years as EU environmental policies and legislation evolve .
The EEA will build on and adapt its existing data flows , indicators and assessments to meet these changing needs

, ozone , toxic and
We will achieve our objective by :
• improving use of air quality information via multi @-@ media , user @-@ friendly , interactive services .
• providing up @-@ to @-@ date and where possible near real @-@ time quality assured data , maps , indicators and streamlined access to relevant ambient air quality websites via SEIS and the EEA Data Centre on air ;
• producing integrated and targeted assessments of air pollution and noise , the impacts on human health and the environment , and the effectiveness and co @-@ benefits of related policies and measures ;
1 ) The issue of indoor pollution is covered in the cross @-@ cutting theme on Environment and health .
To provide assessments related to emissions of pollutants , including toxic and hazardous pollutants , to air and where relevant to other media .
• producing the EU annual emission inventory reports for the UNECE Long @-@ range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention and National Emissions Ceiling Directive and jointly with EMEP the review of national air emission inventory data ;
Although emissions of key air pollutants have decreased in recent years , air pollution still causes substantial adverse impacts on human health , ecosystems and crops .
Polluting emissions in general arising from large and small installations , and diffuse sources , such as from transport , agriculture and households , continue to cause concern .
• providing assessments on synergies and tradeoffs between air pollutant emission and greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and on the effectiveness of selected policies to reduce key air pollutant emissions and subsequent effects on air quality ;
In addition , towards the end of 2009 the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register ( E @-@ PRTR ) will be introduced , replacing the present European Polluting Emissions Register ( EPER ) .
• providing up @-@ to @-@ date and where possible near @-@ real @-@ time quality assured data , indicators and streamlined access to relevant air pollutant emissions websites , via SEIS , Inspire and the EEA Data Centre on air ;
• publishing on the EEA 's website the EMEP / EEA air pollutant emissions inventory guidebook that will be regularly updated by the UNECE EMEP task force on emission inventories and projections ; and
• providing , via SEIS , Inspire and the EEA Environmental Data Centres on Biodiversity and Ecosystems and Land Use , quality assured data in support for European reporting initiatives , most notably the Nature Directives ;
• producing analysis on the state and trends of individual species and habitats as required under relevant articles in the existing community legislation ;
• reporting on progress towards the EU and global targets on halting / reducing the loss of biodiversity using the Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators 2010 ;
• using such analytical inputs and results from EU funded research projects on biodiversity for the EEA 's regular state of the environment and outlooks reports and the European Ecosystem Assessment ( Eureca 2012 ) ; and
• producing analyses and assessments of pathways to achieve a low @-@ carbon and ' greener ' economy .
Global warming will have far @-@ reaching consequences .
Action to address global climate change is both technically feasible and affordable compared to the high costs of unabated climate change .
The Kyoto Protocol targets are a first step to be met by 2012 .
Within UNFCCC a global post @-@ Kyoto regime is being developed with agreement anticipated by the end of 2009 in Copenhagen .
• supporting the UNFCCC review and any technical issues arising from the UNFCCC negotiation process ; and
• creating user @-@ friendly access to reports , data , indicators and other information through the EEA Climate Change Data Centre , with related analytical and decision @-@ support tools .
Freshwater
In the EU , the Water Framework Directive ( WFD ) and related water directives provide an integrated framework within which to address these many and varied challenges to water management .
The first round of River Basin Management Plans and related Programmes of Measures in 2009 mark the crossing of an important threshold from preparation to action in the implementation of the WFD .
• providing user @-@ friendly access to reports , data , including near @-@ real time , indicators , information plus related analytical tools ; and
• improving the public understanding of the issues of water quality and quantity and climate change via multi @-@ media , user @-@ friendly interactive services .
• providing , via SEIS , the EEA Water Data Centre and the Water Information System for Europe ( WISE ) , data , information and indicators collected from countries under relevant
• contributing to the establishment of the GMES marine core services ;
EU policy has now adopted an ' ecosystem approach ' to the management of human activities on the marine environment through its strategies and directives .
We will achieve our objective by :
Cross @-@ cutting themes
• paying special attention to issues that are priorities for the SOER 2010 , Eureca 2012 and IPCC 2013 ; and
Demand for cross @-@ cutting integrated analyses is growing in recognition of rapidly changing realities .
The requirement for connected information on all these processes is growing as a result .
In a globalised economy where individuals , businesses and governments can exert a global reach , many different types of policy can affect the resilience of the natural environment and the resources it provides whether on land or at sea .
• building alliances and capacities within our networks to undertake such cross @-@ cutting analyses and assessments within the context of SEIS .
The work is divided into the ten major cross @-@ cutting themes that occur across the European Union 's political and environmental landscape :
Many uncertainties underlie these realities and how they may play out .
But it is clear that environment and economy have not been equal partners in this relationship .
General objective for 2009 @-@ 2013
To support policy development and evaluation within the cross @-@ cutting themes by :
• Climate change impacts • Vulnerability and adaptation • Ecosystems • Environment and health • Maritime • Sustainable consumption and production and waste • Land use • Agriculture and forestry • Energy • Transport
Climate change impacts on natural resources and human activities are expected to continue despite strong action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Climate change is an additional pressure on natural and human systems , which are already under increasing pressures from globalisation and rising consumption patterns across the world .
• working with research teams across Europe to improve the regionalisation of forward studies of climate change impacts ;
The conclusions were that in every aspect , the changes associated with climate change were widespread and increasing .
Data from the various global observing and in @-@ situ measurement programmes also show that we are experiencing conditions outside the most pessimistic estimates from the IPCC 2007 report .
• creating multi @-@ media , user @-@ friendly , multilingual products on the extent of climate change impacts .
Vulnerability of natural resources and human activities is increasing in Europe as a consequence of climate change .
• reporting on national climate adaptation plans and provide guidance and support for information exchange on regional prevention , management and adaptation strategies and best practice ;
Under the UN FCCC , a 5 @-@ year work programme on impacts , vulnerability and adaptation is being implemented .
A global post @-@ Kyoto regime is being developed including adaptation to climate change , with agreement planned for end of 2009 in Copenhagen .
• producing Eureca 2012 , the first ecosystem assessment for Europe to feed into the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment follow @-@ up ;
Ecosystem services represent the transformation of a number of natural assets into products that people need , benefit from and value .
• increasing awareness about the value and use of natural resources through analyses of market @-@ based mechanisms for ecosystems services ;
• improving knowledge about thresholds and resilience in Europe 's ecosystems and in particular in relation to climate change e.g. carbon absorption , trophic dynamics , provisioning and fragmentation of the landscape ;
• updating EEA indicator frameworks , including SEBI2010 , using an ecosystems services approach and integrate them into the EEA assessments ; and
2.4 Environment and health
There will also be an emphasis on studies that highlight the need for early action and on the benefits of preventive and precautionary measures .
Mid @-@ term evaluations of these programmes recognised the progress made but indicated strongly the need for intensive work in the future .
• providing inputs for all major EEA assessments , including SOER 2010 and Eureca 2012 , its regional assessments , and various international reports and assessments such as the UN Environment for Europe Ministerial Conference ;
They also called for information on environmental determinants with positive health impacts such as biodiverse environments , non @-@ motorised means of transport and housing conditions .
• cooperating with key partners on significant EU inter @-@ institutional processes , and on major events and meetings , such as WHO Ministerial Conference and the 2009 European Public Health Association conference ; and
• improving decision @-@ support tools on dealing with uncertainty , risk , ignorance and precaution within key environment and health issues .
• harmonising the characterisation of seabed and habitat mapping in line with EUNIS compatible broad scale mapping and classification ;
• undertaking analyses on marine ecosystems accounting in relation to maritime socio @-@ economic activities ;
New and more extensive monitoring and analytical methods are now needed for integrated assessments .
These will help connect source organisations and provide online and shared access to the necessary data , to support marine spatial planning and state of the environment reporting .
• creating user @-@ friendly access to reports , data , indicators and other information through the EEA Water Data Centre , with related analytical tools .
2.6 Sustainable consumption and production and waste
• strengthening efforts , in close cooperation with Eurostat , JRC , OECD and the UN , to further develop integrated economic and environmental accounts ;
• undertaking analyses on Life Cycle Analysis , resource availability and productivity , cleaner production and eco @-@ efficient products ;
• developing sustainable consumption and production outlooks and scenarios for Europe ;
• supporting the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive and the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling through analyses of various waste streams ;
• working with business and SMEs to share experiences and good practice on sustainable business strategies , corporate social responsibility , EMAS and the role of retailers ;
It is also reflected in the increased business focus on corporate social responsibility , efficiency in resource use and environmental management systems , and the greater focus on sustainable consumption patterns across Europe .
• strengthening work on sustainable production and eco @-@ innovation , in cooperation with OECD ;
• producing and maintaining indicators on sustainable consumption and production , waste and resources via SEIS and the Environmental Data Centres of Eurostat ;
• improving communication with policy @-@ makers and consumers on how to limit environmental impacts of consumption , and develop options for more sustainable products and production .
• supporting the implementation of the EU Action Plan on SCP , EU thematic strategies , national SCP policies , the global Marrakech process on SCP and the UNCSD review of SCP through
2.7 Land use
• working with ESPON2013 to define and test a new set of territorial indicators to support spatial planning and understanding of different development perspectives ;
• supporting the development of the GMES Land services and Global Observing Systems ; and
2.8 Agriculture and forestry
To provide integrated analyses of land use trends in agriculture and forestry through assessments of their current and future impact on water , soils , air quality , biodiversity and landscapes .
The use of agricultural and forestry land in Europe for producing primary material ( food , feed , biomass for energy and material purposes ) will become more intensive in the coming decades .
This derives from new demands , advances in technology ( e.g. enzymatic digestion of cellulosic material , engineering of food properties , crop breeding including genetically modified organisms etc . ) and changes in farming practices .
Forestry and agriculture increasingly deliver into shared end uses for buildings , energy and biomaterials , which lead to higher demands on the available land area .
The expected impacts of climate change and land conversion for the urban and service sectors will increase resulting pressures on water and soil resources as well as affect biodiversity , landscapes and air quality .
The EEA has worked on agri -environment indicators , developed the concept of high nature value farmland and investigated policy integration , e.g. with regard to bioenergy production .
• providing regular updates on energy and environment indicators , including energy subsidies , and inputs to the EEA integrated assessments ; and
Energy policy will continue to play a central role in combating climate change while at the same time ensuring a secure supply of energy in Europe .
Further efforts are also being made in energy efficiency , reducing energy demand , advancing the establishment of a true internal energy market , stimulating energy research and technology development and enhancing international cooperation on energy issues .
European efforts in this area are tightly coupled to those in the rest of the world .
To assess the impacts of transport on human health and the environment with the help of transport and environment indicators , models and scenarios .
This will include , inter alia , tracking progress towards environmentally related policy targets for transport and seeking to demonstrate possible new solutions for access and sustainable mobility .
Transport is an integral part of most of the activities that together form the basis of a nation 's Gross Domestic Product .
The EU is therefore considering a range of policies and measures such as inclusion of aviation in
• producing indicator @-@ based assessments of the transport sector 's progress in integrating environmental considerations into its policies as input to EEA 's regular integrated and cross @-@ cutting assessments ; the EU emission trading system ; reducing CO2
• analysing traffic 's contribution to air quality and noise in Europe 's cities ; emissions from cars ; and infrastructure charging schemes .
However , we should avoid transport being only associated with climate change ; the Greening Transport package is a step in broadening out the discussion .
• building geographically specific transport emission inventories ;
To a large degree transport policy development is guided by the aim of creating a more ' sustainable transport system ' , with access and mobility at its heart .
But as yet these terms are not operational and do not facilitate environmental improvements .
In response to the increasingly ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets there is a need to develop sector specific targets .
Integrated environmental assessment
To ensure that these assessments support decision @-@ making processes and policy development , increasing emphasis will be given to four elements :
These assessments are needed to help frame , support and evaluate the progress of a wide range of policy processes .
There is also an increased demand to include economic information , forward looking perspectives and to address uncertainties .
However , this growth in the number and diversity of assessments is leading to inefficiencies , overlaps and inconsistencies , which can undermine their effectiveness .
• integrated environmental policy analysis and assessments of national and regional policies and actions to secure the environment e.g. in transport and infrastructure , agriculture ( biotechnologies and transgenic organisms ) energy and industry ( sustainable production and consumption and nanotechnologies ) and in the finance ( insurance ) , and commerce ( distribution ) ;
• decision @-@ making under conditions of risk , uncertainty and complexity and the use of decision support tools ;
• providing more social and economic analyses to help put the interconnectedness of the environment into the mainstream of societal thinking ; and
• intensifying the use of scenarios and other forward looking methods to support the development of sustainable futures .
In line with its founding Regulation , the EEA is required to publish every five years a report of the state and outlook of the European Environment .
The next report is due in 2010 .
The activities under this strategic area are found under five themes :
Over the next five years , the EEA will deliver its main five @-@ year reporting and assessment and with partners develop and contribute to other regional , pan @-@ European and global assessments .
It will also aim to provide a strong basis for the EU Environment Action Programme .
3.1 Integrated environmental assessment
The next state and outlook of the environment report is due in 2010 .
The reports contribute to strategic environmentrelated policy @-@ making at the European level , the evaluation of EU environmental action programmes and strategies and to future agenda setting .
• improving communication and dissemination of the assessment via multi @-@ media , user @-@ friendly , multilingual information ;
Recognising the wide interest in the SOER 2010 , differentiated products and multimedia will be designed to suit the different audiences , including assessments on thematic issues and at country levels .
3.2 Regional and global assessment
• cooperating with Mediterranean Action Programme , Eurostat and other partners to organise a regular reporting process under Horizon 2020 , publishing five @-@ yearly and biennial reports on the Mediterranean environment ;
• planning and preparing the fifth pan @-@ European assessment report ;
Common geographical and environmental patterns characterise specific areas in Europe , such as coastal regions or mountain ranges .
They correspond on the one hand to the reality of Europe 's landscape diversity and , on the other , to some form of targeted processes and policies or more generally territorial cohesion .
The EEA is involved in the production of a number of regional assessments and State of Environment reporting processes .
• participating in the UNGA assessment of assessments for the marine environment , UNEP @-@ GEO , other UNEP DEWA activities and other UN assessments via expert groups and chairmanship of panels ;
• identifying the needs for and providing specific tailor @-@ made assessments on the state of the Arctic environment ;
• improving communication and dissemination on the importance and basis of integrated assessment via multi @-@ media , user @-@ friendly , multilingual information .
3.3 Decision support
• promoting long @-@ term monitoring of surprise @-@ sensitive parameters so as to better anticipate perturbations in biological and health systems ;
• exploring diverse methods for achieving effective public participation in identifying and managing emerging ecological and health issues ;
• developing and using decision support tools in key areas , such as climate change , adaptation , ecosystem valuation and vulnerability assessments ;
There is growing scientific awareness that environmental , ecological and health issues are more complex , multi @-@ causal and inter @-@ connected than previously understood .
• improving and simplifying the terminology used to characterise cause @-@ effect relationships and uncertainties in ecological and biological systems , by fostering the widespread adoption of such terminology ;
• developing with partners a better understanding of the types of jurisprudence that will properly reflect the needs of the environment ; and
• improving awareness of these issues via workshops with a broad range of stakeholders .
Central to these activities will be the maintenance of data repositories .
• developing integrated analysis of economic drivers and environmental problems and policy tools ;
• building inventories and assessments of the role of market @-@ based solutions and environmental tax reforms ;
There is an increasing focus on economic damage and welfare loss in the case of inadequate action or inaction .
At the same time policies and measures must induce effective and least @-@ cost solutions .
Market @-@ based instruments are increasingly recognised as potentially cost @-@ saving tools , and environmental tax reform aims to reconcile environmental , fiscal and social objectives .
• making cost of inaction related valuations of market and non @-@ market damage to ecosystem services and human welfare as input into European eco @-@ assessment programmes ;
• performing integrated analyses of environmental consequences and resources efficiency of main driving forces and of solutions with focus on market @-@ based approaches , such as carbon markets and environmental taxation ;
• carrying out an analysis of environmental tax reform as a response to long @-@ term sustainable reconciliation of environmental , economic / fiscal and social objectives ; and
• further developing methodologies , including benefit transfer , for scaling up of non @-@ market valuation case study results , and valuation in land and ecosystem accounting .
• continuing to support ongoing EEA assessment processes and especially the future analysis for the SOER 2010 , and for the European Ecosystem Assessment ( Eureca 2012 ) ;
• fostering the use of scenarios and nowcasting techniques in strategic decision @-@ making by developing guidelines , best @-@ practice and web @-@ based training tools ;
• initiating new forward looking / scenario assessments in specific areas , regions and topics ;
Following the analysis presented in the 1999 five @-@ year state and outlook report , and the amended Regulation , the EEA was requested to integrate a forward @-@ looking component into its assessments .
• further exploring the current use impacts and effectiveness of scenarios in strategic environmental decision @-@ making ;
• further developing information systems via SEIS for forward looking information and developing better tailored tools to manage forward @-@ looking information ; and
Consequently , the EEA work was expanded beyond the SOER reports , into thematic areas and beyond existing legislation and the borders of the Europe .
During the last strategy period , the main bulk of work consisted of the wide assessment processes involved in the 2005 five @-@ year state and outlook report and for the 2007 ' Environment for Europe ' Belgrade Conference .
In addition , contributions were made to the UNEP Global Environmental Outlook process .
Information services and communications
The aim is to provide products and services with a high readability , usability and message consistency for the EEA 's multilingual user community .
The demand for easy to understand , up @-@ to @-@ date information has grown significantly even during the course of the 2004 @-@ 2008 strategy .
This demand comes from both political decision @-@ makers and from European citizens , who increasingly wish to see full transparency with respect to information provided by public bodies .
Alongside this development , the rapid evolution in new information technologies provides us with tools to communicate more effectively .
The website will evolve from one that stores documents into an interactive site and portal that supports two @-@ way communications and can be effective in helping to improve the quality and spread of environmental education .
Work in this strategic area will be under two themes :
4.1 Shared Environmental Information System
EEA and Eionet will work together with the European Commission and other international stakeholders to implement the system .
SEIS is a distributed , integrated , web @-@ enabled information system based on a network of public information providers sharing environmental data and information .
It is built on existing e @-@ infrastructure , systems and services in the Member States and EU institutions , especially those of the EEA and Eionet .
• developing applications and services related to air , marine and terrestrial environmental monitoring and observations using improved in @-@ situ and space @-@ based monitoring derived from GMES and GEO / GEOSS ;
It will provide easily accessible information to both policy @-@ makers and citizens .
• ensuring system maintenance and management , providing high quality 24 / 7 data and information services ; and
• continuously improving our EEA website , as main portal for providing timely and relevant information on Europe 's environment .
4.2 Communications
Commission and the European Parliament , the Presidency @-@ in @-@ office of the Council of Ministers and the public interests in different regions of Europe ;
• expanding our outreach to cover more sectors engaged in environmental policy @-@ making , research and education , and meeting their needs for environmental information when possible ;
• strengthening and widening our media network and using it to multiply the effect of our messages and increase the visibility of the Agency as a key provider of environmental information ;
• building an end @-@ to @-@ end communications programme in the Agency , fostering strong internal communications and communications training for EEA staff ;
• tailoring our outputs for multiple purposes and audiences , and using a variety of channels to deliver them ;
• implementing a more targeted media approach , selecting the media we wish to work with depending on the messages we want to get across and the target group we aim to reach ;
• creating special web @-@ based education materials ;
• monitoring the effectiveness of our activities to ensure two @-@ way communication and dialogue .

Better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions
• The amount of municipal waste is expected to grow by 25 % from 2005 to 2020 .
• Increased recovery of waste , and diverting waste away from landfill play a key role in tackling the environmental impacts of increasing waste volumes .
• As recycling and incineration with energy recovery are increasingly used , net greenhouse gas emissions from municipal waste management are expected to drop considerably by 2020 .
• Limiting or avoiding growth in waste volumes would further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector and deliver other benefits to society and the environment .
Growing waste volumes of Luxembourg 30 cm thick or Malta 2.5 m thick !
On average , each European citizen generated 460 kg municipal waste in 1995 .
This amount rose to 520 kg per person in 2004 , and a further increase to 680 kg per person is projected by 2020 .
In total , this corresponds to an increase of almost 50 % in 25 years .
However , as shown in Figure 1 , there are significant differences
Historically , disposal by landfilling has been the predominant treatment method for municipal waste , but over the last two decades considerable reductions in landfilling have taken place .
In 2004 , 47 % of total EU municipal waste was landfilled
If we were simply to spread all EU municipal waste generated in 2020 ( i.e. about 340 million tonnes ) on the ground , it would cover an area the size between EU ‑ 15 (

An EEA publication ( 2007 ) illustrates patterns in Member States approaches to waste management , particularly in the context of the Landfill Directive .
( see Figure 1 ) .
This is expected to decrease further to around 35 % by 2020 .
Recycling and other material ‑ recovery operations are expected to increase from the current level of 36 % to around 42 % by 2020 .
Finally incineration was used for 17 % of municipal waste in 2004 and is likely to increase to about 25 % by 2020 .
This pushes direct emissions of greenhouse gases from the waste management sector up .
Landfilling represents 60 % of the total in 2020 , and recycling and incineration about 20 % each .
Overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe , decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Sixth Environment Action Programme .
The projections used in this study assume that waste management capacity grows to match demand . However , if investment in new and
On the other hand , recycling and incineration will be increasingly used .
This represents savings ( or avoided greenhouse gas emissions ) that offset direct emissions .

What is Signals a story @-@ based approach to help us better communicate with this diverse group of people.The eight stories addressed are not exhaustive but have been selected on the basis of their relevance to the current environmental policy debate in Europe .
They address priority issues of climate change , nature and biodiversity , the use of natural resources and health . Signals uses several approaches to tell its stories .
While each story has specific points to make , as a collection , they also illustrate the many inter @-@ relations between seemingly unconnected issues .
We would appreciate your feedback on Signals .
Please submit your comments through the EEA public enquiry form : http : / / www.eea.europa.eu / enquiries .
Remember to write ' Signals ' in the subject field .
From researchers up to their knees in water to satellite imaging from space , we work with a huge amount of environmental data .
Finding , reading and understanding the range of " signals " regarding the health and diversity of our environment is at the heart of what we do .
Signals , which will be published in all 26 EEA languages , takes
Editorial but there are environments without societies .
He estimated that the cost of climate change impacts could be massively reduced if emissions of greenhouse gases were cut immediately .
Initiatives like Stern have helped people to understand what is at stake if we continue our current consumption patterns .
Above all , we need to regain a sense of humility about the natural world because , as indigenous peoples have long understood , we must ultimately answer to nature .
Nature has rules and limits of its own .
Our natural world is the bedrock - not the backdrop - of our society.With Signals , we intend to contribute to this appreciation of the natural environment .
We hope to influence thinking and attitudes and effect the decisions that all of us make every day .
This will be an historic year for the environment culminating in a major UN meeting on climate change in Copenhagen next December .
The meeting , possibly the most important environmental gathering to date , must come up with a successor to the Kyoto Protocol .
Greenhouse gas emissions are just one symptom of a much deeper issue : our inability to live sustainably .
However , the scale of these environmental problems should not paralyse us into inaction .
It should raise our awareness and encourage us to develop new , more sustainable patterns of living , growing , producing and consuming . Ultimately , we are talking about revaluing the fundamental elements of life .
Our natural world often provides a stunning backdrop to our daily lives .
It may be a local stream , pond or stretch of beach .
On a grander scale , we are struck by the beauty of the Alps or the Carpathian mountains , the ancient forests , the great rivers or the stunning coasts .
There were 3 billion people on earth when I was born .
Today there are 6.7 billion of us and we expect the number to rise to 9 billion by 2050 .
The world 's economy , in terms of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , has grown at an unprecedented rate : in 1950 GDP was EUR 4 trillion .
This ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
In contrast to this economic growth , our environment has suffered .
Glaciers are melting in Europe 's mountain ranges with more river flooding expected as a consequence and misery for millions of ordinary people .
Arctic summer sea ice is receding and thinning faster than ever : in 2007 the extent of the sea ice was half that measured in the 1950s .
Around the world , more than a billion , mostly poor , people rely on fisheries for their food and livelihoods .
However , half of all wild fisheries have been fully exploited .
The majority of today 's commercial fisheries are likely to have collapsed by 2050 if current trends are not reversed .
Back on land , rainforests are being decimated for developments that take no account of the many valuable ecological services they provide .
These trends may change our relationship with the natural world but not our reliance on it .
The natural resources provided by the planet underpin our economic activity and the very cohesion of our societies . However , the way we organise our economies does not give sufficient recognition to the dependent nature of this relationship - there are no societies without environments ,
Not just hot air
Global diplomacy and the search for a successor to the Kyoto Protocol
Every winter the gates of Copenhagen 's famous Tivoli Gardens , an old world amusement park in the city centre , open to officially mark the beginning of the extended Christmas period .
It was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in earnest . The summit resulted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .
Meetings of the Convention , known as Conferences of the Parties ( COPs ) , have taken place every year since 1994 .
from agriculture are estimated based on the area of cultivated soils , type of crop , use of fertiliser and the number of livestock ( cattle , poultry , sheep , pigs , etc . ) in the country .
Just as athletes are regularly tested to make sure they stay within the rules , there is regular monitoring .
The latest report released in June 2008 is based on data from 2006 .
It shows that emissions from the EU @-@ 15 were 3 % below the ' base year ' .
What do the numbers mean ?
Kyoto - a first step in cutting emissions
Data from around Europe on emissions of so @-@ called greenhouse gases are collected , verified and then analysed in two key reports that feed into the Kyoto process .
This year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the COP 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
The inventory report - counting gases
The concept of counting gases is quite abstract .
As a result it is also difficult to figure out what a percentage cut or increase in emissions means .
It may help to imagine the cuts as days of the year .
The EU @-@ 15 Kyoto target translates into 29 days worth of emissions.For each of the 5 years between 2008 @-@ 2012 , EU @-@ 15 emissions should be on average , 29 days less than 1990 levels .
In this way , emission reductions must occur consistently over several years.The latest EEA data show that 10 days worth of emissions were cut between 1990 and 2006 .
The EU @-@ 15 must cut 19 more days to meet the target .
Trends and projections
The Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNFCCC , is a first step in the long @-@ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
For example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
They must achieve this target during the period 2008 @-@ 2012 ( 2 ) .Countries are expected to meet their Kyoto targets mainly by cutting emissions at home .
However a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : Get us to Kyoto on time ) . ' Kyoto ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
Immediately after the hand @-@ over of the ' inventory ' report , the EEA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culminating in the ' Trends and projections ' report .
The report is published in the winter just as the annual UN COP meeting is about to meet .
The first EEA greenhouse gas report comes out each spring and is called the ' inventory ' report .
Greenhouse gases in this context refer to a collection of the most serious climate changing gases including : carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide as well as fluorinated gases .
Consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total greenhouse gases emissions in the EU .
Different gases have different ' base years ' under Kyoto . For carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide ( 99 % of all emissions ) 1990 is used as the ' base year ' for all EU @-@ 15 Member States .
For fluorinated gases , countries can choose another year instead .
Twelve EU @-@ 15 Member States have chosen 1995 . The EU @-@ 15 has a joint Kyoto target .
Within this , each EU @-@ 15 Member State has a differentiated reduction target : some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase .
New EU Member States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta , which have no targets .
This report contains a deeper analysis of the emission trends outlined in the first report and pin points where the emissions and emission 's reductions came from .
Most importantly , the report looks ahead and evaluates projections of future greenhouse gas emissions as far as 2012 and beyond to 2020 .
A combination of approaches will be needed to fill the remaining gap , the report says .
Get us to Kyoto on time
Emissions from the EU @-@ 15 were 3 % below ' base year ' levels in 2006 , according to the latest EEA data .
Countries that have signed up to Kyoto must make substantial emissions reductions at home .
The EU ' Emissions Trading Scheme ' ( EU ETS ) is another tool , which helps
- 1 industries to cut their COst emissions in
20 a cost @-@ effective way . Limits have been
- 1 set for all industrial sites that emit a lot
10 of COst

0102030 % ( relative to base @-@ year emissions )
Gap between 2010 projections ( existing measures ) and Kyoto target
During the Kyoto period ( 2008 @-@ 2012 ) developed countries can also trade emission allowances between themselves in order to meet their national targets .
Looking ahead to 2020 , the report gives a long range estimate of the emissions situation in Europe .

The buzz words , ' common but differentiated responsibility ' , first uttered at the Earth Summit in Rio , have popped up ever since in climate change circles .
In simple language the phrase reflects the fact that developed nations have a greater responsibility for the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere .
These countries have been more industrialised , have created more emissions and should have legal targets to cut emissions before developing nations .
It has proved very difficult to turn the concept into action acceptable to both industrialised and developing countries .
Next December , a major task of the COP 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
That means new targets for emissions reductions and most importantly the buy @-@ in of America and major developing nations such as India and China .
We already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
All EU @-@ 27 Member States will be included .
Imagine every truck , bus car , train boat and aeroplane disappearing - in terms of emissions .
It 's ambitious , but it must be because the challenge is serious .
10 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION : WATER AND DROUGHT
Climate change adaptation and water
'We have about 50 litres of bottled water in the apartment for washing and cleaning , just in case .
If the water is off for a really long time we go to my father 's place or to my wife 's parents , ' says Barış , an economics professor at Marmara University .
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION : WATER AND DROUGHT / 11
The old apartment does not have a water tank of its own so the Tekins ' are directly connected to the city 's water system .
A drought in Western Turkey over the past two years means that water is regularly shut off by the city for periods of up to 36 hours .
Water shortages are not new - Barış remembers them from his childhood .
Impacts of climate change government has been forced to apply emergency measures which include cutting water supply by 30 % .
In Turkey , water levels fell consistently last summer , according to the state waterworks authority .
The reservoirs supplying drinking water to Istanbul had 28 % of their capacity .
Aquifers - underground reservoirs - have dropped by 15 metres since 2005 because of over pumping .
Seawater has actually begun to creep in , polluting the remaining supplies .
At an estimated cost of EUR 22 million , six shiploads , each holding enough fresh water to fill ten Olympic swimming pools , were sourced .
The fresh water was to come from Tarragona in southern Catalonia , Marseille and Almeria - one of the driest areas of southern Spain .
Luckily , May was wet , the reservoirs filled sufficiently and the plans were shelved .
However , discussions around diverting water from rivers such as the Ebro and even the Rhône in France continue ( 1 ) .Cyprus is experiencing a catastrophic drought .
Water demand has been increasing over the past 17 years and
3 is over 100 million cubic metres ( m
Over the last three
Current droughts and water crisis must be dealt with in the short term to ensure that people have water .
However , long @-@ term adaptation policies must also be developed .
Governments at local and national level , desperate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water , water transfer and desalination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .
Extremes of heat and drought , rain and flooding are affecting many parts of Europe .
Water scarcity and drought
Greenhouse gases are causing our climate to change .
Southern Europe is expected to become warmer and drier while the North and North West will most likely become milder and wetter .
Overall global temperatures will continue to rise .
However , even if emissions stop today , climate change will continue for a long time due to the historical build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
Impacts are already clear in the Arctic , for example .
We must begin to adapt .
Adaptation means assessing and dealing with the vulnerability of human and natural systems .
EU Member States agree that global temperature increases should be limited to 2 ° C above pre @-@ industrial levels in order to avoid severe changes to our climate .
Mitigation efforts are focused on cutting emissions of ' greenhouse ' gases .
Limiting temperature increases to 2 ° C
Climate change mitigation and adaptation are very closely linked .
The more successful mitigation efforts are in cutting emissions , the less extensive our need for adaptation .
As temperatures rise , southern Europe 's reserves of water will drop .
At the same time , agriculture and tourism will require more water especially in the hotter drier regions.An increase in water temperatures and lower river flows in the south will also affect water quality .
Reservoirs that were at 20 % of their capacity in March are now 44 % full .
Some plants now make use of solar energy , which is a positive step .
However , desalination is still expensive .
Also , the salty brine , a by product of the process is difficult to dispose of and can harm the environment .
Managing our water resources
'It is often over 40 ° C here in the summer and the humidity can be very high , ' Barış says from Istanbul .
Mediterranean countries are increasingly relying on desalination to provide fresh water .
Spain currently has 700 desalination plants , which provide enough water for 8 million people every day .
Desalination is expected to double over the next 50 years in Spain.Water shortages are not restricted to Southern Europe .
The United Kingdom is constructing its first desalination plant in east London .
At a cost of GBP 200m , more than EUR 250m , the facility could supply 140 million litres of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .
This means taking action to reduce and manage demand instead of simply trying to increase the supply of water .
The Water Framework Directive ( WFD ) , the defining piece of legislation on water in Europe , obliges Member States to use pricing ( charging money ) for water @-@ related services as an effective tool for promoting water conservation .
Indeed water pricing is one of the most effective methods of influencing water consumption patterns .
Better information will help us adapt

The Water Exploitation Index ( WEI ) ( Figure 1 ) is a good example of the type of information needed to give an overview of the scale and location of the problems facing us .
As the graph shows , nine countries are considered ' water stressed ' : Belgium , Bulgaria , Cyprus , Germany , Italy , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Malta , Spain , and the United Kingdom ( England and Wales ) .
WEI data are available for England and show that the South East and London are especially stressed .
This level of information is key in terms of effective adaptation to climate change .

Looking ahead shows that 50 % of the Mediterranean coastline is built on .
Water shortages and drought are already an issue in many of these regions .
More apartments , more tourists and more golf courses mean increased demand for water .
Coastal areas in the North and West of Europe , where increased flooding is expected , are also being rapidly developed . The integration of adaptation into key EU policies has been limited .
However , the European Commission is expected to publish a White paper on adaptation in 2009 .
A recent EEA report points out that only seven of the 32 EEA countries have actually adopted National Adaptation Strategies for climate change , so far .

Adaptation to water shortages in the Alps ( in preparation ) .
An upcoming EEA report considers the Alps , often described as the ' water tower of Europe ' because 40 % of Europe 's fresh water comes from the mountain range .
The Alpine region has experienced temperature increases of 1.48 ° C in the last hundred years - twice the global average .
As such they act as an iconic symbol of the scale of the threat and the type of response required .
Adaptation strategies and policies must include local , cross border , and EU @-@ wide elements .
Seemingly unconnected activities , such as farming and tourism , energy production and public health must be considered together . Ultimately , adaptation means reconsidering where and how we live now and in the future .
How we will protect ourselves from extreme events ?

14 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / BIODIVERSITY : INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES
Killer slugs and other aliens
Is gardening one of your interests ?
If so and you live in central or northern Europe , the ' killer slug ' is probably one of your personal enemies .
The slug , which attacks your herbs and vegetables relentlessly , seems immune to control measures .
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / BIODIVERSITY : INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES / 15
The killer slug , known scientifically as Arion lusitanicus , is also called the ' Spanish slug ' because it is native to the Iberian peninsula .
The slug is hermaphrodite and can spread very quickly .
More aggressive than the native black slug it eats weaker slugs .
The killer slug started to spread around Europe about 30 years ago , travelling as eggs in the soil of potted plants .
Most arrive as stowaways and are transported unwittingly around the globe .
Invasive alien species often exact a high financial cost from their new homes .
Alien weeds reduce European agricultural yields and Dutch elm disease - caused by an introduced fungus - has devastated elm trees in the forests of central Europe .
Initial estimates put the cost in Europe at more than EUR 10 billion per year .
About 10 000 alien species have been registered in Europe .
Others , called ' invasive alien species ' create serious problems as pest species to gardening , agriculture , forestry as vectors of diseases or by damaging constructions such as buildings and dams .
Invasive alien species also change the ecosystems they live in and impact on the other species in those ecosystems .
Biodiversity - the wider context ecosystems and existing native plant and animal species . The problem of invasive species is expected to worsen in the coming century through climate change , increasing trade and tourism .
Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on earth .
It represents the planet 's natural wealth and as such provides the basis for our lives and prosperity .
It supports many basic services that we depend on such as the water we drink and the air we breathe .
It helps to pollinate crops , put food on the table , regulate weather patterns and clean up our waste .
Currently , biodiversity is vanishing at an alarming rate mainly because of how we misuse nature to sustain production , consumption and trade in the globalized economy we live in .
The other main threats to biodiversity come from pollution , climate change and over @-@ exploitation of resources .
As the world 's population is forecast to grow from 6.7 billion people today to nine billion in 2050 , it is expected that the impacts on biodiversity from the current main threats will grow and losses increase .
Without biodiversity we would not be able to survive . As such it can be seen as an insurance policy provided to us by the planet .
Invasive alien species are considered by many conservationists to be the second greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide .
Whether introduced deliberately or accidentally , such species can cause havoc to people ,
IAS and Europe - increasing impacts contact can result in strong dermatitis .
Today , the giant hogweed is most likely beyond eradication in Europe while early actions ( up to the 1950s ) probably would have had better prospects .
In line with this , the European Commission in the recent communication on biodiversity underlined the need for an ' early warning ' mechanism for invasive alien species .
The most @-@ wanted list
Alien species come in all shapes and sizes .
Some are deliberately introduced and economically important , others have little impact but quite a few have been a disaster .
As a result , a first step in developing control and management measures , is to identify the most offensive species so that efforts are directed towards these .
The list currently contains 163 species or species groups .
Many also affect human health and the economy .
Since 1950 , on average more than one of the listed species establishes itself each year and there is no clear sign that the situation is improving ( Figure 1 ) .
Alien species can be found in all European ecosystems .
Control measures
The most efficient defence against invasive alien species is prevention - basically a border patrol blocking new species .
A second step is early detection and control .
A striking example is the giant hogweed , Heracleum mantegazzianum , introduced to Europe as an ornamental plant in the 19th century .
The plant is now subject to considerable local control efforts as the species has established in grasslands , along railways , roadsides and along river banks .
Forming dense stands the hogweed crowds native plants out .
It is also poisonous and direct skin

Actions necessary to counter invasive alien species include measures for management and restoration which are usually both difficult and costly .
For example , control measures against the killer slug have been cumbersome and often have only a local and temporary effect .
The EU also finances studies of these species within the ' programme for research and technological development ' .The problem of invasive alien species is not going away .
Every breath you take
* The characters in this story are fictional .
However the data are real .
The story is set on 27 July 2008 when an air quality warning was issued in Brussels people 's health or the environment has still not been reached .
EEA analysis suggests that 15 of the 27 EU Member States will miss one or more of their legally binding 2010 targets to reduce harmful air pollutants .
Particulate matter and ozone
Two pollutants , fine particulate matter and ground @-@ level ozone , are now generally recognised as the most significant in terms of health impacts .
Long @-@ term and peak exposure can lead to a variety of health effects , ranging from minor irritation of the respiratory system to premature death .
Particulate matter , a term used to describe a variety of tiny particles from sources such as vehicle exhausts and domestic stoves , affects the lungs .
As much as 61 % of the urban population may have been exposed to levels of ozone that exceed the EU target .
Anna is 37 years old and lives in the centre of Brussels .
She and her young son Johan are planning a trip outside the busy city .
Anna suffers from asthma and her doctor has warned of the dangers of air pollution , especially on hot summer days.Anna has heard about the London fogs of the 1950s that killed 2 000 people in one week .
She has childhood memories of evening news bulletins showing dead fish and dying trees as ' acid rain ' first came to popular attention in the 1970s .
Motherhood and a recent asthma attack have quite rightly brought air pollution back to mind .
The fact is that emissions of many air pollutants have fallen substantially across Europe since Anna 's childhood .
The air she and Johan breathe is much improved compared to the past , and air policy is one of the great success stories of the EU 's environmental efforts .
In particular , EU policy has dramatically cut emissions of sulphur , the main component of ' acid rain ' .
A significant proportion of Europe 's urban population still live in cities where EU air quality limits , protecting human health , are regularly exceeded .
Each year , many more people die prematurely from air pollution in Europe than die in traffic accidents .
Nitrogen But what 's that smell ?
A tractor is spraying liquid manure onto a field not far away .
This is irritating , Anna thinks , but it 's also part of real country life which is shown in a rather more romantic way in Johan 's picture books .
The pungent smell is caused by as many as 40 different chemical substances emitted from the manure .
) , a volatile nitrogen compound , is one of them .
( NH3 is caustic and can damage very high concentrations NH3
A day in the country the respiratory tract .
However , the levels here are not dangerous for human health .
Anna can breathe a sigh of relief , albeit a stinky one .
Anna is planning a day in the country with Johan .
Using maps , Anna can scan readings and forecasts for particulate matter , ozone , nitrogen dioxide , sulphur dioxide among many others . The data are relayed to the web from monitoring stations around the country .
Ozone incident in Brussels 27 July 2008
Very high
The reading , taken minutes earlier , shows high levels of ozone in Brussels .
Indeed the website forecasts that levels will exceed EU target values later that day and again the following day ( Figure 1 ) .
Anna leaves her apartment building and makes for the nearest Metro station , a 10 minute walk away .
Out on the street , the full impact of the city 's traffic problems are easy to see - and smell .
Exhaust emissions from cars in the centre of Brussels , and all major cities , irritate the respiratory tract and eyes and lungs .
Anna and Johan turn into their local train station and head for the countryside.Soon , Anna and Johan are entering a national park just outside Brussels .
A sign tells them that they are visiting a Natura 2000 site - one part of a European @-@ wide ecological network , set up to secure natural habitats and to maintain the range of plant and animal life .
A similar service , providing local information on particulate matter levels across Europe is being developed .
Looking ahead Because air pollution pays no regard to national boundaries the problem needs to be tackled internationally .
The United Nations Convention on Long @-@ range Transboundary Air Pollution ( LRTAP Convention ) agreed in 1979 , has been signed by 51 countries and forms the basis of the international fight to tackle air pollution .
In parallel , the EU has developed polices limiting the total emissions of each Member State , setting legally binding limits .
The ' National Emissions Ceiling Directive ' ( NECD ) is a key EU policy .
It sets ' ceilings ' or limits for
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient in nature .
Reactive nitrogen forms are actually used by our bodies to produce proteins .
However , excess nitrogen can lead to severe environmental and health problems .
'Acid rain ' forms when high levels of sulphur and nitrogen oxides are present in the air .
One of the great success stories of air pollution policy over the last decades has been the massive reduction in emissions of sulphur dioxide .
The 32 EEA member countries reduced sulphur emissions by 70 % between 1990 and 2006 .
Nitrogen , on the other hand , has not been dealt with as successfully .
With sulphur emissions declining , nitrogen is now the principal acidifying component in our air .
Agriculture and transport are the main sources of nitrogen pollution .
Agriculture is responsible for more than 90 % of ammonia ( NH
Suddenly Johan , who has been walking unsteadily loses his balance and falls into a clump of stinging nettles .
Having picked him up and brushed him off , Anna notices nettles everywhere .
She has vivid memories of them as a child in a neighbour 's garden .
Then the nettles grew around a compost heap that was also used as a dump for poultry dung .
It occurs when too many chemical nutrients ( such as N ) are available to an ecosystem either on land or in water .
In water , excessive plant growth and subsequent decay occur , which in turn leads to further effects including oxygen depletion .
The fence protecting the area offers no defence - in fact building a greenhouse around the area would be the only way to protect it totally from airborne substances .
Climate change mitigation efforts will improve air quality
In January 2008 , the European Commission proposed a Climate and Energy package to :
It has been estimated that the above package will cut the cost of meeting EU air pollution targets by EUR 8.5 billion per year .
The savings to the European health services could be as much as six times that figure .
The efforts required to meet these targets will also cut air pollution in Europe .
For example , improvements in energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy will both lead to reduced amounts of fossil fuel combustion - a key source of air pollution .
These positive side effects are referred to as the ' co @-@ benefits ' of climate change policy .
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 ; • increase the share of renewable energy by 20 % by 2020 ; • improve energy efficiency by 20 % by 2020 .

The European Commission is also taking countries to task for having missed earlier limits and , where sufficient measures have not been outlined to improve performance , has begun infringement proceedings .
Later that evening Anna , while watching the evening news , sees that an air quality warning has been issued by the government in response to high ozone levels beyond the EU threshold .
The warning advises people with breathing problems to take precautions such as avoiding strenuous exercise while the ozone levels remain high .
Belgium , France , Germany and the Netherlands believe that new policies and measures , not yet enacted , will help them reach their 2010 emissions ceilings .
In addition , several other Member States believe they will over achieve their original ceilings .
Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy
A shrinking resource Almost 80 % of Europeans live in big cities , towns or the urban settlements between the two , far removed from the realities of agriculture .
Our rural landscape nevertheless has a huge significance in terms of providing food , raw materials , fuel and recreational opportunities .
The CAP in context
The CAP was introduced in 1962 and consumes 40 % of the entire EU budget .
In 2007 this translated into over EUR 54 billion .
Agriculture contributes to 1.2 % of EU GDP and 4.7 % of all jobs in the EU ( 1 ) .
The CAP currently has two ' pillars ' : production and there is a stronger focus on rural development and environmental objectives .
CAP is currently undergoing a ' health check ' by the European Commission , the European Parliament and Members States .
In the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the EEA is also preparing an analysis of the CAP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsidy 's ' environmental ' spending .
Where is the money going and what effect is it having ?
What follows is a preview of some of our findings .
• Pillar I provides direct aid and market interventions to secure food production and farmers ' income , and making European agriculture more competitive .
It is the dominant part of the budget , responsible for 77.5 % of the total CAP expenditure in 2006 .
• Pillar II recognises the central role of farming as a supplier of food and goods , as the cornerstone of rural societies and as a potential environmental manager .
The measures , implemented through Rural Development programmes , are aimed at restructuring the agriculture sector and encouraging environmental protection , diversification and innovation in rural areas .
Farmers manage half of the EU 's land area and have a huge impact on Europe 's soil , water and biodiversity .
Recent analysis shows that agriculture uses half of the water available in southern Europe .
In the EU @-@ 15 , farming causes almost half of the nitrogen pollution in rivers , 94 % of ammonia emissions and 9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
Many of our rarest species are actually dependent on the continuation of traditional farming practices .
High nature value ( HNV ) farmland is land that is particularly rich in habitats and species of conservation concern .
It is often associated with traditional or low intensity agriculture , which is not very economical .
Most farmers have intensified production or abandoned farming altogether - trends that threaten natural habitats.An important agriculture policy challenge is to provide economic incentives to farmers for a continuation of wildlife friendly farming practices .
The Common Agriculture Policy ( CAP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @-@ war food shortages .
The subsidy has increasingly been decoupled from its original goal of increasing food
The EEA has analysed the current expenditure pattern to check how the CAP may contribute to maintenance of HNV farmland .
Current data show the allocation of CAP funding at a national level .
Information within countries is much less detailed .
As a result the EEA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
Pillar II is dedicated to the development of rural areas and also funds environmental management schemes .
Data for EU @-@ 25 , 2006 .
Countries with a high share of HNV farmland receive comparatively little under Pillar I of the CAP budget ( Figure 1 ) .
This is not surprising given that this pillar was originally production @-@ related and is most common in areas of intensive farming .
Pillar II ( rural development ) expenditure per hectare generally increases with HNV farmland share .
However , spending on agri @-@ environment schemes - the element most related to conservation - is not strongly connected to the amount of HNV farmland in the areas studied ( Figure 2 ) .
It should also be noted that this intervention accounts for less than 5 % of total CAP payments .

Hiding in the tall grass
Black @-@ tailed godwits are tall , long @-@ beaked wading birds found along Europe 's shoreline and in wet meadows .
In 1975 there were 120 000 breeding pairs in the Netherlands .
Today there are about 38 000 .
Numbers of breeding pairs are dropping across Europe .
Conclusions from this example could be applied to the entire CAP budget in terms of its environmental improvement efforts : the CAP is having an effect but it 's not effective enough .
However , this ' package ' of measures would be very expensive .
In these areas a combination of measures should be taken such as late and irregular mowing , low nutrient inputs and maintenance of high water tables .
Godwit chicks must eat about 20 000 insects in the first week of their life if they are to survive .
Scientists agree that earlier mowing practices by farmers are at the root of the godwit population decline .
The first grass cutting in the Netherlands happens three weeks earlier then 40 years ago , probably due to improved fertilisation .
Insect populations are much higher in tall grasses and increase even further in grasslands that have not been heavily fertilised .
In short grass , parent birds simply cannot find enough insects to feed their chicks in those crucial first days .
Predators have also become a larger threat because chicks are easy prey in the open short cut grasslands .
In 2006 EUR 1.2 billion of the CAP budget was allocated for the Netherlands , some of which was used to encourage later grass @-@ cutting .
Studies have shown that the survival rate of godwits chicks doubles on pastures benefiting from the late cutting .
This in a nutshell sums up the challenge facing CAP where targeting of funds and design of policy at a local level is crucial .
In 2006 , EUR 1.2 billion was spent under Pillar I in the Netherlands ; EUR 83.2 million was spent under Pillar II .
The single farm payments , under Pillar I , are still very much targeted at farms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .

Consequences for biodiversity Ultimately , the effect of the CAP payments on maintenance of HNV farmland is what counts in this analysis .
The available information does not support a clear answer due to a lack of spatial detail .
The EEA case studies confirm that the majority of Pillar I subsidies are targeted to the most productive areas .
Biodiversity is low here and the subsidy provides little incentive to environment @-@ friendly production .
Assessing whether the subsidies are adequate to prevent both land abandonment on the one hand and intensification on the other , however , would need further study .
The evidence regarding the implementation of agri @-@ environment schemes suggests that their effectiveness could be improved .
Some of the measures are promising whilst others show little effect .
In addition , depopulation of the countryside and changing lifestyles may be posing overarching threats to traditional farming systems that in the long run cannot be solved through subsidies .
Looking ahead
Funding for the CAP will be part of a major review of the entire EU budget in 2009 @-@ 2010 .
The limited information available suggests that the current distribution of CAP funds is not very effective from the perspective of achieving EU environmental objectives , in particular on nature protection .
One further result of the EEA analysis is that the available statistical information on CAP spending patterns is still not sufficient to properly evaluate the effects of this important policy .
Enhancing Pillar II and targeting measures at high nature value farmland is a valid option , but requires careful design and evaluation to prevent unintended negative impacts .
Fish out of water
Marine management in a changing climate
A fisherman 's tale On the night of 6 October 1986 lobster fishermen from the small town of Gilleleje , north of Copenhagen , fishing the Kattegat Sea , found their nets crammed with Norway lobster .
Many of the animals were dead or dying .
About half were a strange colour .
If left alone for two years , the cod population in the Baltic would recover
Henrik Sparholt , ICES Advisory Programme Professional Officer
The region has become an international case study with lessons for other regions .
Fishing for data
The strange events were caused by ' anoxia ' or lack of oxygen on the sea bed that night .
These decisions often reflect priorities other than the protection of stocks .
In 2006 , approximately 45 % of the assessed fish stocks in Europe 's Seas were fished outside safe biological limits .
These fishing levels were agreed at the ministerial level .
Fish breathe oxygen dissolved in water
For centuries the abundance of fish was the cornerstone of the local economy .
In the 1970s about half of the fisheries income came from cod .
By the end of the 1980s cod fisheries had increased to 80 % of the total value .
Many fishermen imagined a bright future and invested in new vessels .
However , by 1990 the catch was on a steep decline .
This collapse put huge financial pressure on the local community .
Cod in the Baltic ( 1 000 tonnes cod )
When water near the seabed becomes anoxic , hydrogen sulphide is released from the sea floor into the water .
Hydrogen sulphide is toxic to most life forms , and it was probably a combination of hydrogen sulphide and lack of oxygen that killed the Norway lobsters in the Kattegat that night back in 1986 .
This reduces the spawning success of cod .
Why were the early 1980s such good years for cod fisheries ?
Catch
In almost every year when the cod stock has been assessed , the TAC has been set higher than the recommended level .
The TAC exceeds the recommended level by more than 100 % in some of the most recent years .
Interestingly , the actual catch is commonly higher that the TAC because estimated illegal fisheries are also included in the figures .
Source : EEA , 2008 .
The high survival rate of cod eggs and larvae from 1978 @-@ 1983 is explained by four factors .
The primary explanation is that fishing pressure was reduced in the late 1970s .
Secondly , climatic conditions brought inflows of high salinity water from the North Sea .
The Baltic was actually a freshwater lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
Salinity in the Baltic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea .
This means that stocks of cod and other marine fish are likely to decline further unless fishing pressure is reduced .
Illegal fishing adds to the problem .
It has been estimated that an additional 30 % is landed illegally in this part of the Baltic Sea .
And then climate change !
In response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Baltic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Baltic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integrating agricultural , fisheries and regional policies . This plan , adopted in
Climate change is affecting both the temperature and the salt balance of the Baltic .
Both factors are driven by climate .
Quite a small reduction in the salinity is already tipping the balance and changing the composition of the Baltic habitat .
Of the three major fished species , cod , herring , and sprat , cod is particularly sensitive to reduced salinity because salinity affects both their reproductive capacity and the availability of the preferred food for cod larvae .

Sampling stations
When this reaction occurs , oxygen concentrations are considered negative ) in Autumn 2007 .
Over time , there has been a steady increase in the area affected by hydrogen sulphide in the East and West Gotland Basins , and the outer Gulf of Finland .
Water from the Gulf of Finland does not enter into the Gulf of Bothnia .
As a result , despite its depth , it remains well oxygenated , even during autumn .
Climate change will alter the Baltic Sea and its ability to support exploitable cod populations .
Management will need to accommodate these changes if the stock is to stay at a commercially relevant level Professor Brian MacKenzie , DTU @-@ Aqua , Technical University of Denmark
November 2007 , is an important basis for more effective implementation of EU policy in the area .
This strategy 's adoption by Member States will constitute one of the priorities of the Swedish EU Presidency , in the second half of 2009 .
Sweden has identified the Baltic Sea environment as one of its top priorities .
The Common Fisheries Policy ( CFP ) was designed to regulate fishing activities from an environmental , economic and social point of view .
However , many of the most commercially valuable fish species in Europe have been heavily over fished and their populations are now below safe biological numbers .
The switch from oil to bioenergy is not risk free
Bioenergy is not new .
For millennia , people have been burning wood .
The industrial revolution in the mid @-@ 1800s brought so called ' fossil fuels ' , mainly coal and oil , to the fore .
However , fossil fuels are becoming more difficult to find and extract , more expensive , and subject to intense political debate .
Biomass : refers to living and recently dead biological matter .
This can be from crops , trees , algae , agricultural , forest residues or waste streams .
Bioenergy : all types of energy derived from biomass , including biofuels .
Biofuel : liquid transport fuels made from
Bioenergy is on the verge of becoming big business .
It is already the dominant renewable energy source ( 1 ) in Europe and its production is likely to increase greatly in the coming decades .
The EEA 's work on biofuels is restricted to the environmental pros and cons .
Even here , there is controversy .
A move towards large scale bioenergy production bears considerable environmental risks , mainly in terms of land @-@ use change .
Soils and plants are damage our soil and water resources .
Knock @-@ on effects , so @-@ called ' indirect land @-@ use changes ' , would impact elsewhere in the world : as Europe cuts back on food exports , other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap .
Impacts on global food prices could be significant .
However , risks within Europe could be lessened with the right choice of crops and management .
Biofuels made from waste , from crop or forestry residues for example , do offer environmental advantages .
In this context , the EEA has been looking at how the impending bioenergy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the two largest stores of COst
Rushing to renewables containing twice as much carbon as our atmosphere .
Converting forest , peat or grasslands en masse to biofuel crops would release more COst than it
The European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , etc. as well as bioenergy ) by 2020 .
At the moment , renewables account for 6.7 % of European energy consumption .
Two thirds of this comes from biomass.The European Commission is also keen to promote biofuels - fuel for transport - as diversification is particularly important in transport because of its dependence on oil .
The transport sector is also increasing greenhouse gas emissions and eating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . The Commission has therefore proposed that biofuels make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certified as sustainable .
Renewable energy includes energy derived from wind , sea , sun , hydropower , etc.The term biofuel can be used for all fuels ( solid , liquid or gas ) for any purpose derived from biomass .
However , in the context of this analysis it refers specifically to fuels for transport .
This is important because deforestation and farming practices are currently responsible for an estimated 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions .
The EU biofuel target is surrounded by more and more debate .
The European Parliament has recently called for a guarantee that 40 % of the 10 % target will come from sources that do not compete with food production .
The EEA 's own Scientific Committee has warned that increasing the share of biofuels used in transport to 10 % by 2020 is overambitious and should be suspended .
Global impacts - food prices and land @-@ use change
Promoting biofuels and other bioenergy in Europe inevitably triggers direct and indirect effects elsewhere .
For example , in Europe we could produce biodiesel from rapeseed oil in a sustainable manner , but less rapeseed oil would be available for food production inside and outside Europe .
The gap is likely to be filled in part by palm oil .

ENVIRONMENT do away with this storage function .
It would take decades for the benefits to outweigh the negatives.The impacts on biodiversity and natural resources such as water are more difficult to measure .
According to one recent study , meeting the 2022 targets in the US energy bill will increase nitrogen loads in the Mississippi by 10 @-@ 34 % .
Modelling the future
To avoid the negative impacts of a switch to bioenergy described above , we need strong policies at international level to prevent land @-@ use changes adding to environmental problems in the pursuit of bioenergy .
We should move on from biofuels , and begin serious research and development of advanced biofuels ( see box ) .
And let 's do it in a way that considers all the environmental impacts , including effects on soil , water and biodiversity as well as greenhouse gas emissions .
In this way the EU can take the lead in building a truly sustainable bioenergy sector .
How much bioenergy can Europe produce without harming the environment .
EEA Report No 7 / 2006 .
Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation , Paris .
A lot more research is needed on these production processes and their impacts and opportunities .
Moreover , competition for land and water between dedicated energy crops and food crops will likely remain .
This process harnesses the heat that is a by @-@ product of energy production .
There are costs , of course .
Enhancing bioenergy use is around 20 % more expensive than a similar model of conventional energy by 2030 .
Also , high oil prices could also affect the results .
However , a clear message still emerges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate mitigation , to prioritise bioenergy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
International shipments of waste and the environment
Waste without borders
The truth is that waste placed in a bin in London , can quite easily end up 5 000 miles away in a recycling factory in China 's Pearl River delta .
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WASTE SHIPMENTS / 35 disposal from EU Member States nearly quadrupled between 1997 to 2005 , this aim has yet to be fulfilled .
The factors driving the export and import of waste vary : availability of special treatment technology ; a shortage of materials ; differences in prices for disposal or recovery .
EU policy , setting targets for recycling , also leads to waste shipments from Member States who cannot meet their targets at home .
The volumes of waste on the market keep costs low for a country like China , which needs cheap raw materials .
As long as this waste is not for disposal at its destination and does not contain hazardous materials , it is deemed to be an acceptable trade .
Is your old TV better travelled than you are ?
It is difficult to tell if a television is being exported as a second hand device , which is acceptable or as waste for disposal , which is not .
In general , export of WEEE from the EU to non @-@ OECD countries is prohibited .
However , the export of a TV that still works is perfectly acceptable .
Tracking down good data on electric and electronic waste
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the shipment of hazardous and problematic waste .
However , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment.Electronic waste , which is considered hazardous , is an important case .
In Africa and Asia it is often dismantled with little or no personal protection equipment or pollution control measures .
Waste of all descriptions is on the move .
Increasing amounts , especially of waste paper , plastics and metals are being shipped from developed countries to countries where environmental standards are less stringent .
Huge ships steam around the high seas everyday carrying goods from emerging markets in Asia to the West .
That does not mean that shipments of waste are not regulated . Both the UN and the EU have strict rules on what can be shipped where .
The ban contained in this Convention has not been signed by enough countries to bring it into force globally .
However , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' hazardous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
A ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .The EU 's long term aim is that each Member State should dispose of its own waste domestically ( the ' proximity principle ' ) .
However , as shipments of hazardous and problematic waste for
36 / EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WASTE SHIPMENTS
Driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .
This suggests that the EU ban on the trade of hazardous waste with non @-@ OECD countries is being broken .
Using European trade statistics it is possible to identify the amounts , size and value of exports of used electronic and electrical products shipped from the EU to other regions ( Figure 1 ) .
In 2005 , more than 15 000 tonnes of colour television sets were exported from the EU to African countries .
In Nigeria , Ghana and Egypt alone about 1 000 TV sets arrived every day .
The average value of exported colour television sets to Africa is very low : for Africa as a whole the price per unit was EUR 64 and EUR 28 on average for the three countries mentioned above .
In comparison , TV sets traded within Europe have an average value of EUR 350 .
The amount of waste paper exported to Asia increased by a factor of ten .
For plastics the increase has been a factor of eleven and for metals a factor of five .
The shipped waste has also increased within the EU , but at much lower level .
In 2007 as much waste paper was shipped to Asia as was shipped from one EU country to another .
The quantity of metals shipped within the EU was larger than the amount shipped to Asia .
For over a decade , the cost of raw materials has been very high and this , in turn , has increased the value of secondary raw materials reclaimed through recycling .
For example , the amount of paper and cardboard ' packaging waste ' that is recycled increased from about 24 to 30 million tonnes between 1997 and 2005 .
The amount of plastic packaging recycled has increased from about 10 to 14 million tonnes in the same period .
Is it good for the environment ? The use of recycled waste materials instead of virgin materials is generally good for the environment .
For example , a kilo of paper made from recycled raw materials uses half the energy of production using virgin materials .
Aluminium produced from recycled aluminium can use as little 5 % of the energy needed using virgin materials .
In general , recycling therefore contributes substantially to the reduction of energy @-@ related emissions of COst and
EEA SIGNALS 2009 / WASTE SHIPMENTS / 37
Within the EU , transboundary shipments of waste for disposal , as well as ' hazardous and problematic ' waste for recovery , must be notified to the national authorities .
This ' national ' notification is very detailed .
However , a summarised version of the data on the shipments is all that is passed onto the European
Commission , so the overview at an EU level is unclear.If more detailed information , especially on the types of waste shipped , were reported , the overview would allow a much better assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of the shipments . It could help us to tell whether waste shipments

The EU is increasingly acting like a common market in terms of hazardous and problematic waste treatment .
Indeed , from 1997 to 2005 the export of these types of waste from one EU Member State to another quadrupled .
Within the EU it is possible to ship all kinds of wastes for disposal or recovery between Member States .

The data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shipped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don 't know whether it is bad for the environment .
More detailed reporting of national data to the EU could facilitate this .
In 2005 20 % of the waste shipped was for disposal while 80 % was shipped for recovery operations .

Signals is an annual publication from the EEA .
The simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be replicated on a much grander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and empower the public environmentally .
Robust , far @-@ sighted policy also requires better , more detailed information .
Two new EU initiatives , in which the EEA is playing a leading role and which will be further developed throughout 2009 , are at the heart of this drive .
They are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( GMES ) and the Shared Environmental Information System ( SEIS ) .GMES will use satellites and sensors on the ground , floating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment .
It is , however , difficult to tell whether the fisheries will become richer or not .
Shipping and tourism are likely to increase , although drift ice , short sailing seasons and lack of infrastructure will impede a rapid development of transcontinental shipping .
Traffic linked to extraction of Arctic resources on the fringes of the Arctic sea routes will most likely grow first .
