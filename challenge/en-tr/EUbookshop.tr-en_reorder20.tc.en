for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports questionnaires ( ARQ ) and it had been regularly reported to the CND ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
in countries where the NDO is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug coordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see Figure 7 ) :
• the organisational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @-@ production ) " ( 3 ) .
in all ESPAD countries at least two thirds of the students have drunk alcohol at least once during their lifetime , with an ESPAD average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited comparability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more evenly distributed pattern , with spirits as the most important type , constituting about one third of the total consumption .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
lifetime use of magic mushrooms was reported by 3 % while GHB and steroids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same magnitude as reported experience of intravenous drug use .
only 1 @-@ 2 % in Armenia , the Faroe Islands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @-@ prevalence countries are most often found in western Europe .
overall , one out of seven past @-@ year cannabis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing cannabis @-@ related problems , and the average prevalence of high @-@ risk users across countries was 2 % .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @-@ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall upward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @-@ variation between illicit drug use and cannabis use on the country level , quite naturally the development for lifetime cannabis use is more or less the same as described for all illicit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illicit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ESPAD countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of cannabis between 2003 and 2007 .
the upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lifetime use of illicit drugs - predominantly cannabis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ageing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
the emergence of mCPP illustrates the fact that those involved in the production of illicit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chemicals that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to potentiate or modify the effects of MDMA ( ecstasy ) .
there are similarities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @-@ 04 action plan , conducted externally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and internally by the Institute for Drugs and Addiction ( IDT ) .
first , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 in June 2005 .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @-@ 04 ) , the steering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the EMCDDA and Europol , as well as representatives of the Member States .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise definition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
directive 91 / 308 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modified in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among Member States .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
difficulties in defining the quantity of a single dose and evidence that the exception has been misused in court to benefit drug dealers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annulment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint directive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutors @-@ General dealt with cannabis @-@ related infringements .
the aforementioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sentencing of over 1 800 cases in six different Länder ( Schäfer and Paoli , 2006 ) .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used cannabis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by stealing ( Kivivuori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sentencing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social reintegration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the sanction under surveillance .
in most EU Member States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
in this regard , it is helpful that the concept of selective prevention does not focus on drug use and does not stigmatise drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulnerability in a broader sense .
several Member States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( Figure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see Chapter 6 ) .
32 receiving such treatment stabilised or decreased (
the reduction of drugrelated deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing infectious disease are clearly geared towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for delivering medical and social services .
an initiative in this direction is the joint EMCDDA @-@ correlation project , supported by experts from the national focal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the cannabis resin seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Senegal , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; INCB , 2006a ) .
( 50 ) Taking 1999 as the base year for the value of money in all countries . ( 51 ) See Figure PPP @-@ 2 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 52 ) See Table PPP @-@ 5 in the 2006 statistical bulletin . ( 53 ) The average proportion was computed as the average of national prevalence rates weighted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
participation in ESPAD has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU Member States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 40.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lifetime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @-@ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lifetime prevalence ranges from 32 % to 40 % .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( EMCDDA , 2004a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily cannabis users .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in adolescents seeking treatment for cannabis use who have coexisting mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influencing demand for treatment ( 78
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @-@ onset users ( pre- to mid @-@ adolescence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( Von Sydow et al . , 2002 ; Chen et al . , 2005 ) .
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interventions may take the form of counselling , " cannabis courses " or even self @-@ help websites .
for example , the German website @-@ based counselling programme , Quit the Shit ( www.drugcom.de ) , is an innovative approach , using telematics , for cannabis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .
data on both number of amphetamine seizures and quantities of amphetamine seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on quantities of amphetamine seized were not available for Slovenia in 2004 ; data on number of amphetamine seizures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .
total number of tablets analysed in 2004 .
demands for treatment related to ecstasy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ecstasy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about acute or chronic health problems requiring medical interventions relating to the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hallucinogenic substances by young people .
the decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances so that measures applicable in the Member States for the control of narcotic and psychotropic substances ( 2 ) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances if appropriate .
most of the cocaine seized in Europe comes directly from South America ( mainly Colombia ) or via Central America and the Caribbean . in 2004 , Suriname , Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , Ecuador , Curaçao , Jamaica , Mexico , Guyana and Panama were reported as transit countries for cocaine imported into the EU ( Reitox national reports , 2005 ; WCO , 2005 ; CND , 2006 ; INCB , 2006a ; Europol , 2006 ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe better identified by focusing the analysis on groups in which drug use is concentrated , in particular young people living in urban areas .
as cocaine use can escalate quickly , brief interventions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth exploring .
for example , one study of an innovative outreach treatment programme in Rotterdam ( Henskens , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for treating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
Netherlands ( 167 ) . the average purity of heroin products has been fluctuating in most reporting countries ( 168 ) since 1999 , making it difficult to identify any overall trend .
for example , in countries with a high proportion of stimulant users ( the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , the rates of injecting among heroin users might not be representative of the overall situation .
in some EU @-@ 15 Member States from which data are available ( Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom ) , rates of injecting among heroin users in treatment have declined .
in France , where HIV cases have been recorded only since 2003 , there has been an increase in the incidence of HIV among IDUs ( albeit from a low level ) , from an estimated 2.3 cases per million population in 2003 to 2.9 cases in
41 % of a sample of 964 in 2001 to 54 % of 350 in 2005 ) and exceptionally high in another ( Kohtla @-@ Järve : 90 % out of 100 ) .
since the mid1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see Chapter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of epidemic spread of HIV among injectors .
in 2003 @-@ 04 , prevalence rates of over 60 % among IDU samples were reported from Italy and Poland , while samples with prevalence rates of less than 20 % were recorded in Belgium , Ireland , Cyprus , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
in Finland , hepatitis B notifications among IDUs have fallen steeply in recent years , possibly as a result of vaccination programmes and a comprehensive needle and syringe exchange system .
the purchase of syringes through pharmacies may be a major source of contact with the health service for some injectors , and the potential to exploit this contact point as a conduit to other services clearly exists .
it was estimated that in six of the locations ( Amsterdam , Barcelona , Dublin , London , Rome and Vienna ) 10 @-@ 23 % of the overall mortality among adults aged 15 @-@ 49 years could be attributed to opioid use , mainly overdoses , AIDS and external causes ( accidents , suicides ) .
in this section , and in the EMCDDA protocol , the term " drugrelated deaths " refers to those deaths caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs and , generally , occurring shortly after the consumption of the substance ( s ) .
national trends in drugrelated deaths can provide some insight into developments in patterns of problematic drug use in each country such as heroin epidemics and high @-@ risk behaviours ( e.g. injection ) , as well as treatment provision and even differences in heroin availability .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreases in the numbers of drugrelated deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment availability and harm reduction initiatives , although declines in the prevalence of drug use may also be important .
although interpretations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of drugrelated deaths in some countries , these patterns could be related to the trends in heroin injection ( 209 ) .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging Member States to develop and expand harm @-@ reduction activities .
drug use among those who are developing both physically and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompanying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison settings .
the EMCDDA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems arising from lack of security .
of drug treatment data and drug overdoses suggests that the heroin @-@ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
however , a study commissioned by the EMCDDA has shown that it is possible to assess Coordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Coordination outcomes ( Kenis , 2006 ) .
a first observation is that such instruments can be useful for a longitudinal follow @-@ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be contextualised with the analysis of individual indicators within the indexes .
this figure is likely to underestimate the full extent of drug @-@ related public expenditure , given the high level of under @-@ reporting . the six countries included in Table 1 account for 76 % of the total public expenditure reported by EU Member States
in response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @-@ 08 , the EMCDDA is currently working towards developing a methodology that will enable the Member States , candidate countries and Norway to compile standardised data on drug @-@ related expenditure .
in Ireland , substantive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 , which sets out new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour and proposals to strengthen imposition of the 10 @-@ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EUR 13 000 or more .
in Romania , a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use , as well as measures to improve judicial cooperation , surveillance and cross @-@ border pursuit and transfer of legal procedures .
the term " reports " for drug law offences is given in quotation marks because it describes different concepts in different countries ( police reports of suspected drug law offenders , charges for drug law offences , etc . ) .
taking peer @-@ reviewed scientific publications as an indicator of scientific activity , an analysis of such publications during 2005 and 2006 and quoted in the national reports reveals a pattern of thematic research priorities that varies between countries .
EU funding for drug @-@ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @-@ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
although selective prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in peer @-@ to @-@ peer programmes ( Cho et al . , 2005 ; Dishion and Dodge , 2005 ) , because negative " Contagion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the outpatient clients are treated for primary opioid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular cannabis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
in some countries ( e.g. Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , structured reintegration programmes are provided only as a follow @-@ on from successfully completed abstinence @-@ based drug dependence treatment , and specific reintegration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using cannabis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in cannabis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lifetime prevalence rates in the range 10 @-@ 25 % ( 32
developing psychometric scales to identify intensive , dependent and problematic cannabis use in survey data there are important temporal differences between countries and waves of popularity observable in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 1960s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Reitox national report ) where a relatively high level of experimentation was reported in the 1970s among conscripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 1970s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s onwards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable insight into trends over time .
however , there are interesting variations between countries , with cannabis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . for the remaining countries , in 12 the proportion of
there are differences between countries in the frequency of cannabis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily cannabis users and the other half with less than 30 % .
in Denmark , smash is an anonymous support and counselling project for young cannabis users , intended to reduce the harmful effects , provide information and support to help them stop smoking cannabis ( 52
in recent school surveys , increases in lifetime prevalence of ecstasy use occurred largely in parallel among both male and female school students , although there is a progressive increase in the gender gap with increasing age .
imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversifying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
estimates of cocaine use for shorter reference periods ( 98 ) suggest that in the last year , of the 3.5 million ( 2.4 % ) young adults who have used the drug , 1.5 million ( 1 % ) have used it in the last month .
estimates of problematic cocaine use are scarce and the PDU indicator is , except in few high @-@ prevalence countries , likely to be less reliable for this drug . ) See Figure PDU @-@ 4 ( part II ) in the 2007 statistical bulletin .
of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( TDI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requesting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 123 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
in the EU Member States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug substitution treatments was at least 585 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service availability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem opioid use were available for 2005 , the extent of substitution treatment among problem opioid users was calculated ( Figure 10 ) .
the absolute decrease of new opioids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the proportion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .
figure 10 : number of opioid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem opioid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be homeless .
most clients ( 60 % ) report initiation of opioid use before the age of 20 ; first use of opioids after the age of 25 was very uncommon ( 133 ) .
in interpreting this data , a number of considerations should be borne in mind : infected IDUs may not be diagnosed if they are not in contact with health services ; new infections may not necessarily be attributed to drug injection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analysing levels of HIV infection in samples of new IDUs ( those injecting less than two years ) and young IDUs ( those under age 25 ) .
most available time series for the EU show stable prevalence , suggesting that the numbers of infected IDUs dying are balanced by the numbers of IDUs contracting HIV infection .
among young IDUs ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high prevalence ( over 40 % in at least one sample ) was found in seven countries and among new IDUs , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United
in Europe , most opioid deaths are related to heroin , but often other substances are also identified as having possibly played a role , in particular alcohol , benzodiazepines , or other opioids and , in some countries , cocaine .
figure 13 : overall trend in acute drug @-@ related deaths , 1996 @-@ 2005 for all Member States with available data account for a decreasing proportion of overdoses ( 170 ) .
a collaborative study that started within an EMCDDA project found that opioid users recruited in treatment in eight European locations had a very high mortality compared to their peers of the same age ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) .
increases in the proportion of drug @-@ related deaths in drug users aged under 30 years have been observed in Greece and among those aged under 25 years in Estonia , Luxembourg and Austria , and to a lesser extent in Latvia and
a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of treatments for heroin addiction , which will examine the association between retention in treatment and mortality , is currently underway in Italy ( Bargagli et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from opioid drugs are at an elevated risk of an overdose , if they relapse back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @-@ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @-@ 12 ) .
local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conceal and do not necessitate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more recreational basis .
however , patterns of stimulant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most commonly used stimulant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
relatively high levels of initiation also appear to be still occurring in some Member States , as indicated by studies among injecting drug users that show a relatively high proportion of young and new injectors .
in 2008 , 13 EU Member States have already redrafted or are due to review and redraft their national drugpolicy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policymaking at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will renew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will renew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will renew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking offence .
in the period 2004 @-@ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @-@ enacted it after 12 years without , and the UnitedKingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal definitions of personal use were widened from a maximum of one dose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 doses .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe lack of qualified research staff ( Latvia , Hungary ) ; and methodological aspects ( data protection issues , problems in reaching hidden populations , lack of continuity in research projects ) .
in addition to publications specialising in illicit drugs and addiction , articles on illicit drug use are also published in peer @-@ reviewed journals from a wide array of disciplines and in professional magazines .
around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe substitution treatment and needle and syringe exchange programmes ( NSPs ) , which target overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases .
in Hungary , where NSPs and outreach work have been increasing , a study among the out @-@ of @-@ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
financial support for harmreduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among injecting drug users and in prison settings . "
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wales in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
( Reitox national reports ) . herbal cannabis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Nigeria , Angola ) , south @-@ east Asia ( Thailand ) , south @-@ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americas ( Colombia , Jamaica ) ( CND , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
cannabis can be cultivated in a wide range of environments and grows wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultivated in 172 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @-@ 03 , the number of cannabis resin seizures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities intercepted increased until 2003 @-@ 04 , but thereafter have been declining .
the data on European drug seizures mentioned in this chapter can be found in Tables SZR @-@ 1 , SZR @-@ 2 , SZR @-@ 3 , SZR @-@ 4 , SZR @-@ 5 and SZR @-@ 6 in the 2008 statistical bulletin .
however , there are still differences between countries in the methodology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conservatively estimated that cannabis has been used at least once ( lifetime prevalence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15- to 64 @-@ year- olds ( see Table 2 for a summary of the data ) .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years ) have ever used cannabis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
estimating intensive and long @-@ term patterns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
although among cannabis users the last month prevalence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and binge drinking among cannabis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
a comparison of HBSC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreasing trend in both lifetime and other more frequent cannabis use among 15 @-@ year @-@ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , cannabis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
overall , primary cannabis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequency of use : those who use it occasionally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
project Prism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs , through a system of preexport notifications for licit trade and the reporting of shipments stopped and seizures made when suspicious transactions occur .
seizures of safrole , which may replace 3,4 @-@ MDP @-@ 2 @-@ P in the synthesis of MDMA , remained marginal in 2006 , with 62 litres seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seizure of safrole ( 7 litres ) .
for example , recreational and less intensive and damaging patterns of use among socially wellintegrated users can coexist with intensive use among more marginalised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risky modes of administration , such as injection and smoking .
only one Member State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amphetamine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 12000 and 22000 problem amphetamine users ( 4.3 to 7.9 casesper1000 , aged 15 @-@ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem opioid users in the country .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe been reported by Latvia and Denmark , while in Sweden and Finland the percentage of new amphetamine clients declined , possibly suggesting an ageing population ( 67 ) .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of methamphetamine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) .
stable thereafter . a marked increase in amphetamine use is reported in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 , but the results of the 2005 survey indicate a decrease in the use of this substance since the beginning of this decade ( 73
countries with sufficient data on last year prevalence of amphetamine use among the 15 @-@ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
West Africa : now a regional transit hub for trafficking to Europe amount seized in Portugal since 2005 , accounting for 28 % of the European total in 2006 , points to the growing use of the Iberian peninsula by cocaine traffickers as an entry point to the European market .
the second is a more marginalised group of clients who are typically smoking or injecting cocaine ( see EMCDDA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either crack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 crack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the UnitedKingdom ( 102 ) .
following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several Member States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adapting their traditionally opioid @-@ oriented services to the varied cocaine and crack @-@ using populations .
for example , the incentive could be vouchers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abstinence . in this scenario , failure to stay drugfree results in the loss of the accumulated gains .
the amount of heroin intercepted in an average seizure varied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seizure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( Figure 6 ) .
global seizures of acetic anhydride ( used in the illicit manufacture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 litres in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 litres ) and Colombia ( 8 800 litres ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 litres ) ( INCB , 2008b ) .
Opioid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational attainment than other clients ( see Chapter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequency of co @-@ morbid psychiatric disorders is noted .
prescription of medical heroin ( diamorphine ) , as a treatment option for chronic treatment @-@ resistant opioid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 815 clients in 2006 ) , the UnitedKingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive diamorphine according to a special regulation .
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
by the end of 2006 , the incidence of diagnosed HIV infection among injecting drug users ( IDUs ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
data on newly diagnosed cases related to injecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @-@ 02 , which was due to outbreaks in Estonia , countries , HIV prevalence remained unchanged during the period .
the EMCDDA definition of druginduced deaths ( 136 ) refers to those deaths that are directly caused ( poisonings or overdoses ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substances present is an illicit
the second component is broader and covers deaths which cannot be directly attributable to the pharmacological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @-@ term consequences of infectious diseases , interactions with mental health issues ( e.g. suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e.g. road traffic accidents ) .
a recent Norwegian study of a cohort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 189 recorded deaths , overdoses , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extrapolated from cohort studies to local ( Bargagli et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( Cruts et al . , 2008 ) .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e.g. consequences of other infectious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and estimation in this area ( see preceding section ) .
the USA , for example , softened its approach to the provision of sterile injecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @-@ borne infections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @-@ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @-@ term data .
commentary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @-@ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young males . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
again , market factors and precursor chemicals appear important here , with methamphetamine production sites appearing now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilitates the import of precursors , in this case 1 @-@ phenyl @-@ 2 @-@ propanone ( BMK ) , from outside of the European Union .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @-@ based products , in particular herbal mixtures , as well as merchandise containing synthetic compounds .
the enforcement of drug prohibition is judged by the study to have caused substantial unintended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e.g. geographical displacement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identifies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Coordination , cooperation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international cooperation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which reviews current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN Member States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
the involvement of nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the preparatory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Drugs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @-@ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 2008a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of finalising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @-@ 08 programme with a 1 @-@ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UNGASS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narcotic Drugs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU Member States .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new offence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EUR 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @-@ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evaluating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combines training in life @-@ skills with normative education and knowledge acquisition on substances .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bullying , past @-@ week and past @-@ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drinks on one occasion and having tried cannabis .
selective prevention intervenes with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scarce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
the mean age of drug users entering inpatient treatment is 30 years , but opioid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @-@ cocaine stimulants ( 28 ) and cannabis ( 26 ) .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment modality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see Figure 1C ) .
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their tenancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consensual crime , " where consenting individuals secretly participate in an unlawful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e.g. during a foot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a Scottish study , which found that recovering drug users who received employment @-@ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( McIntosh et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including computerised databases and dedicated communication networks .
prisoners are entitled to the same level of medical care as persons living in the community , and prison health services should be able to provide treatment for problems related to drug use in conditions comparable to those offered outside prison ( CPT , 2006 ; WHO , 2007 ) .
north America continued to account for the bulk of herbal cannabis seized ( 66 % ) , while quantities of resin seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 66 % ) ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
information on the potency of locally produced herbal cannabis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean potency of nederwiet was observed , from a peak of 20.3 % in 2004 to 16.0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .
the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs ( ESPAD ) uses standardised methods and instruments to measure drug and alcohol use among representative samples of 15- to 16 @-@ year @-@ old school students .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe among young adults ( 15 @-@ 34 years , recalculated by the EMCDDA ) and a last year prevalence of 21 % .
( 1 ) England and Wales.NB : see Figure GPS @-@ 4 in the 2009 statistical bulletin for further information.Sources : Reitox national reports ( 2008 ) , taken from population surveys , reports or scientific articles .
only two of the countries monitored by the EMCDDA that participated in ESPAD school surveys in 2007 ( Lithuania , Slovakia ) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lifetime cannabis use since 2003 , while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period ( 54 ) .
the scientific literature suggests that a number of psychotherapies , such as motivational and cognitivebehavioural therapies , are effective for cannabis treatment but that none has been found to be more effective than the others ( Nordstrom and Levin , 2007 ) .
preliminary evaluation results of the " Quit the shit " intervention for cannabis users in Germany has shown that 32 % of participants reported abstinence after completing the programme and that first @-@ time treatment seekers , in particular , were reached .
last year use of the drug is much lower , with a European average of 0.5 % . these estimates suggest that around 12 million Europeans have tried amphetamines , and about 2 million have used the drug during the last year ( see Table 5 for a summary of the data ) .
76 ) Survey data on " amphetamine use " often do not distinguish between amphetamine and methamphetamine , though , as use of methamphetamine is uncommon in Europe , prevalence should typically reflect the use of amphetamine ( sulphate or dexamphetamine ) .77 ) Data from all ESPAD countries and Spain . see Figure eye @-@ 2 ( part vi ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .

Dexamphetamine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amphetamines in England and Wales , where it may be prescribed by any doctor . however , information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited .
in countries where amphetamines dominate the market in illicit stimulant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Conversely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illicit stimulant , low levels of amphetamine use are reported .
it is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lifetime , on average 3.9 % of adults aged 15 @-@ 64 years ( see Table 8 for a summary of the data ) .
visiting nightclubs was also associated with increased cocaine use , as nearly 10 % of the 16- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds who visited a club on four or more occasions during the last month report last year use of cocaine , compared with 3.3 % among those who had not visited a club .
( 1 ) England and Wales NB : see Figure GPS @-@ 14 ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin for further information.Sources : Reitox national reports ( 2008 ) , taken from population surveys , reports or scientific articles .
Spain reports the highest proportions among all clients ( 45 % ) and new clients ( 60 % ) , followed by the Netherlands ( 32 % and 29 % ) and Italy ( 23 % and 26 % ) .
the first group typically reports snorting the drug , and sometimes consuming it in conjunction with other substances such as alcohol or cannabis , but not with opioids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
( 101 ) See Tables TDI @-@ 10 , TDI @-@ 11 ( part III ) , TDI @-@ 21 and TDI @-@ 103 ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin . ( 102 ) See Table TDI @-@ 17 ( part IV ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
in addition , 11 Member States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or crack cocaine users .
0 Estimates of the prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries during the period 2002 @-@ 07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @-@ 64 ; overall prevalence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000 .
it has also launched , in collaboration with the University of Zurich , a study to test a new " one @-@ day " method using the distribution of " latency time " ( time to treatment ) in a cross @-@ sectional sample of treated heroin users .
similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seizures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . in the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @-@ related cases may also be observed .
injecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @-@ borne infections ( e.g. HIV / AIDS , hepatitis ) or druginduced deaths .
treatment reports also suggest that among opioid users , the popularity of injecting may vary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the proportion of injectors among new opioid clients ranges from 0.9 % to 47.2 % .
in France , for example , a decrease in the prevalence of injecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initiation of heroin use has become increasingly
the German Phar @-@ Mon system , which monitors a wide range of medications that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of prescription opioids , where substitution drugs play a more important role than analgesics ( Roesner and Küfner , 2007 ) .
access to sterile injecting equipment through needle and syringe programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and counselling for infectious diseases by 16 countries and the dissemination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
( 140 ) Experts from 26 EU countries , Turkey and Norway rated the level of provision of selected interventions to drug users . ( 141 ) See Table HSR @-@ 5 ( part i ) and ( part II ) in the 2009 statistical bulletin .
known causes of deaths include acute toxicity , traffic accidents in particular when combined with alcohol ( EMCDDA , 2007c ) , violence , suicide among already vulnerable people , or chronic conditions due to repeated use ( e.g. cardiovascular problems in cocaine users ) .
during the period 1990 @-@ 2006 , between 6 400 and 8 500 druginduced deaths were reported each year by EU Member States , Croatia , Norway and Turkey , adding up to more than 135 000 deaths . in 2006 , the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths .
population mortality rates due to druginduced death vary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @-@ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( Figure 13 ) .
reducing drugrelated deaths families of drug users to recognise and manage drug overdoses ; in eight countries , such materials are available for police officers ; and in seven countries , they have been developed for prison staff ( 155 ) .
education about overdose risk is reported by all countries , and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users .
drug users are informed about overdose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abstinence , the effects and risks of polydrug use , in particular concomitant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
according to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @-@ release counselling on overdose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .
the appearance of synthetic cannabinoids marks the latest stage in the development of " designer drugs " : from those based on fentanyl in the 1980s ; to ring @-@ substituted phenethylamines in the late 1980s and tryptamines in 1990s ; to piperazines and cathinone derivatives in the 2000s .
products marketed on the Internet and in some specialised shops under the name " spice " have been available since at least 2006 . although " spice " may be advertised as incense , when smoked the effects are described by some users as similar to those of cannabis .
the use of opiates and cannabis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psychopharmacologically induced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tranquillisers ) tend to reduce violent impulses and aggression .
Studies of drug @-@ related crime have often overlooked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by definition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the proportion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
most neurobiological research on addiction has focused on the role a drug @-@ released neurotransmitter called dopamine has on the repeated activation of the " reward system " - circuitry made up of a complex set of cerebral structures which act as a barometer , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
spurred on by recent technological developments occurring rapidly in this field , newmodels have arisen which take into account the implication of other neurotransmitters in the process , also exploring the role of genetic differences between individuals .
integrate ecosystem services linked to climate change , resource use and health ; account for use of natural capital ( i.e. water , land , biodiversity , soil ) in decisions on sectoral management .
meeting the target of limiting global temperatures increases to less than 2 ° C will require a concerted global effort - including further substantial GHG emission reductions in Europe .
paramount to attainment of good status by 2015 under the WFD ( will be a reduction in the excessive nutrient levels found in a number of water bodies across Europe , as well as the restoration of connectivity and hydro @-@ morphological conditions .
the issues of water quantity and quality , irrigation water demand , water @-@ use conflicts , environmental and socioeconomic aspects and risk management aspects can be better integrated in the institutional and political systems .
the overall challenge which the WFD can help tackle , if implemented fully , is to ensure the sustainable availability of good water quality , as well as managing inevitable trade @-@ offs between competing uses , such as domestic use , industry , agriculture and the environment ( see also Chapter 6 ) .
manufactures ( 221 million tonnes ) in 1999 : 397 million tonnes in 1999 : 1 340 million tonnes in 2008 : 536 million tonnes in 2008 : 1 798 million tonnes
the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates the environmental burden of disease in the pan @-@ European region at between 15 and 20 % of total deaths , and 18 to 20 % of disability @-@ adjusted life years
in the 2020s , the estimated increase in heat @-@ related mortality resulting from projected climate change could exceed 25 000 per year , mainly in central and southern European regions ( 69 ) .
at the same time what happens in the Arctic also influences Europe 's environment because the Arctic plays a key role , for example , in the context of climate change and related sea @-@ level rise projections .
for example , combining climate change mitigation and air pollution abatement legislation could deliver benefits in the order of EUR 10 billion per year through reductions in damage to public health and ecosystems ( A ) ( 11 ) .
) The hot summer of 2003 in Europe , for example , has been estimated to have led to EUR 10 billion of economic losses to farming , livestock and forestry from the combined effects of drought , heat stress and fire .
reducing regional disparities , the main goal of the European Union 's cohesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � ER ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Cohesion Report , February 2004 ) .

in support of this process , the European Environment Agency has prepared a series of assessments of the environment for the pan @-@ European region to provide policy @-@ relevant , up @-@ to @-@ date and reliable information on the interactions between the environment and society .

overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe , decoupling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Sixth Environment Action Programme .
the natural resources provided by the planet underpin our economic activity and the very cohesion of our societies . however , the way we organise our economies does not give sufficient recognition to the dependent nature of this relationship - there are no societies without environments ,
from agriculture are estimated based on the area of cultivated soils , type of crop , use of fertiliser and the number of livestock ( cattle , poultry , sheep , pigs , etc . ) in the country .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Cop 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @-@ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the Kyoto ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to Kyoto on time ) . ' Kyoto ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
governments at local and national level , desperate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reservoirs for storing water , water transfer and desalination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .
a sign tells them that they are visiting a Natura 2000 site - one part of a European @-@ wide ecological network , set up to secure natural habitats and to maintain the range of plant and animal life .

in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Baltic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Baltic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integrating agricultural , fisheries and regional policies . this plan , adopted in
knock @-@ on effects , so @-@ called ' indirect land @-@ use changes ' , would impact elsewhere in the world : as Europe cuts back on food exports , other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from renewables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , etc. as well as bioenergy ) by 2020 .
the transport sector is also increasing greenhouse gas emissions and eating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that biofuels make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certified as sustainable .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' hazardous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .The EU 's long term aim is that each Member State should dispose of its own waste domestically ( the ' proximity principle ' ) .
Commission , so the overview at an EU level is unclear.If more detailed information , especially on the types of waste shipped , were reported , the overview would allow a much better assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of the shipments . it could help us to tell whether waste shipments

the simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be replicated on a much grander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and empower the public environmentally .
they are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( GMES ) and the Shared Environmental Information System ( SEIS ) .GMES will use satellites and sensors on the ground , floating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment .
