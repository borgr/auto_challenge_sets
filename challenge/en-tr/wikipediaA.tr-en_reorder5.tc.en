the oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a pendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road .
note : in this article the step by step mathematical derivations will not be included , but will focus on the major equations and concepts in vibration analysis .
this simple relation can be used to understand in general what will happen to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness .
the mass then begins to decelerate because it is now compressing the spring and in the process transferring the kinetic energy back to its potential .
in this simple model the mass will continue to oscillate forever at the same magnitude , but in a real system there is always damping that dissipates the energy , eventually bringing it to rest .
: formula _ 8Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential equation : : formula _ 9The solution to this equation depends on the amount of damping .
if the damping is increased just to the point where the system no longer oscillates the point of critical damping is reached ( if the damping is increased past critical damping the system is called overdamped ) .
the plots to the side present how 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratios effect how the system will " ring " down over time .
if the system cannot be changed , perhaps the forcing frequency can be shifted ( for example , changing the speed of the machine generating the force ) .
in other words , if energy is to be efficiently pumped into both the mass and spring the energy source needs to feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency .
applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing , a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher .
in the case of our square wave force , the first component is actually a constant force of 0.5 newton and is represented by a value at " 0 " HZ in the frequency spectrum .
the remaining components are at odd frequencies and it takes an infinite amount of sine waves to generate the perfect square wave .
hence , the Fourier transform allows you to interpret the force as a sum of sinusoidal forces being applied instead of a more " complex " force ( e.g.
in the previous section , the vibration solution was given for a single harmonic force , but the Fourier transform will in general give multiple harmonic forces .
hence , the solution to the problem with a square wave is summing the predicted vibration from each one of the harmonic forces found in the frequency spectrum of the square wave .
it happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7 HZ .

in mathematics and physics , a phase space of a dynamical system is a space in which all possible states of a system are represented , with each possible state of the system corresponding to one unique point in the phase space .
for every possible state of the system , or allowed combination of values of the system 's parameters , a point is included in the multidimensional space .
as a whole , the phase diagram represents all that the system can be , and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise .
within the context of a model system in classical mechanics , the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system 's dynamic variables .
because of this , it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past , through integration of Hamilton 's or Lagrange 's equations of motion .
in this sense , a point in phase space is said to be a microstate of the system .
when used in this sense , a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in , for example , the liquid phase , or solid phase , etc .
since there are many more microstates than macrostates , the phase space in the first sense is usually a manifold of much larger dimensions than the second sense .
clearly , many more parameters are required to register every detail of the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify , say , the temperature or the pressure of the system .

= = History = = The history of nuclear physics as a discipline distinct from atomic physics starts with the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 , while investigating phosphorescence in uranium salts .
this was a problem for nuclear physics at the time , because it indicated that energy was not conserved in these decays .
as an example , in this model ( which is not the modern one ) nitrogen @-@ 14 consisted of a nucleus with 14 protons and 7 electrons ( 21 total particles ) , and the nucleus was surrounded by 7 more orbiting electrons .
Rasetti discovered , however , that nitrogen @-@ 14 had a spin of 1 .
= = = Proca 's equations of the massive vector boson field = = = Alexandru Proca was the first to develop and report the massive vector boson field equations and a theory of the mesonic field of nuclear forces .
in the Yukawa interaction a virtual particle , later called a meson , mediated a force between all nucleons , including protons and neutrons .
this force explained why Nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence of proton repulsion , and it also gave an explanation of why the attractive strong force had a more limited range than the electromagnetic repulsion between protons .
the center of the atom contains a tight ball of neutrons and protons , which is held together by the strong nuclear force , unless it is too large .
this research became the science of particle physics , the crown jewel of which is the standard model of particle physics which describes the strong , weak , and electromagnetic forces .
Superimposed on this classical picture , however , are quantum @-@ mechanical effects , which can be described using the nuclear shell model , developed in large part by Maria Goeppert @-@ Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen .
for example , in Beta decay a nitrogen @-@ 16 atom ( 7 protons , 9 neutrons ) is converted to an oxygen @-@ 16 atom ( 8 protons , 8 neutrons ) within a few seconds of being created .
in many cases this process continues through several steps of this kind , including other types of decays , until a stable element is formed .
in gamma decay , a nucleus decays from an excited state into a lower energy state , by emitting a gamma ray .

in 1965 , he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals , in Kent , Ohio , with about 100 of the world 's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance .
this conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field , which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials .
an extended , structurally rigid , highly anisotropic shape seems to be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior , and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings .
however some techniques , such as the use of boundaries or an applied electric field , can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample .
for instance , a particular type of LC molecule ( called mesogen ) may exhibit various smectic and nematic ( and finally isotropic ) phases as temperature is increased .
thus , the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid , but still maintain their long @-@ range directional order .
only chiral molecules ( i.e. , those that have no internal planes of symmetry ) can give rise to such a phase .
in some liquid crystal systems , the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light .
Chiral discotic phases , similar to the chiral nematic phase , are also known .
for instance , the concentrated protein solution that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is , in fact , a liquid crystal phase .
there are a number of fairly simple theories , however , that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems .
for a typical liquid crystal sample , S is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8 , and generally decreases as the temperature is raised .
= = = Maier @-@ Saupe mean field theory = = = This statistical theory , proposed by Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier , includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent liquid crystal molecules .

these ideas eventually led to the creation , by James clerk Maxwell , of the first unified field theory in physics with the introduction of equations for the electromagnetic field .
usually this is done by writing a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian of the field , and treating it as the classical mechanics ( or quantum mechanics ) of a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .
the dynamics of a classical field are usually specified by the Lagrangian density in terms of the field components ; the dynamics can be obtained by using the action principle .
it should be noted that the scalars ( and hence the vectors , matrices and tensors ) can be real or complex as both are fields in the abstract @-@ algebraic / ring @-@ theoretic sense .

the type of T cell activated , and the type of response generated , depends , in part , on the context in which the APC first encountered the antigen .
this affinity depends on the type and orientation of the antigen / MHC complex , and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together .
the factors that dictate whether an infection will trigger a Th1 or Th2 type response are not fully understood , but the response generated does play an important role in the clearance of different pathogens .
in general , Th1 responses are more effective against intracellular pathogens ( viruses and bacteria that are inside host cells ) , whereas Th2 responses are more effective against extracellular bacteria , parasites including helminths and toxins .
like cytotoxic T cells , most of the CD4 + helper cells will die upon resolution of infection , with a few remaining as CD4 + memory cells .

in classical statistical mechanics , the equipartition theorem is a general formula that relates the temperature of a system with its average energies .
the original idea of equipartition was that , in thermal equilibrium , energy is shared equally among all of its various forms ; for example , the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom in the translational motion of a molecule should equal that of its rotational motions .
like the virial theorem , it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature , from which the system 's heat capacity can be computed .
however , equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy , such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring .
the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the ideal gas law , and the Dulong @-@ Petit law for the specific heat capacities of solids .
the equipartition of kinetic energy was proposed initially in 1843 , and more correctly in 1845 , by John James Waterston .
in 1876 , Ludwig Boltzmann expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system .
in 1819 , the French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thérèse Petit discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element .
the theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3 cal / ( MOL · K ) , whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7 cal / ( MOL · K ) .
according to the classical Drude model , metallic electrons act as a nearly ideal gas , and so they should contribute ( 3 / 2 ) " N " e " K " B to the heat capacity by the equipartition theorem , where " N " e is the number of electrons .
Experimentally , however , electrons contribute little to the heat capacity : the molar heat capacities of many conductors and insulators are nearly the same .
although equipartition provides a simple derivation of the ideal @-@ gas law and the internal energy , the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the partition function .

in mathematics , Laplace 's equation is a second @-@ order partial differential equation named after Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace who first studied its properties .
its use to represent the Laplacian should not be confused with this use .
the temperature distribution in the interior will then be given by the solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem .
solutions of Laplace 's equation are called harmonic functions ; they are all analytic within the domain where the equation is satisfied .
this property , called the principle of superposition , is very useful , e.g. , solutions to complex problems can be constructed by summing simple solutions .
the close connection between the Laplace equation and analytic functions implies that any solution of the Laplace equation has derivatives of all orders , and can be expanded in a power series , at least inside a circle that does not enclose a singularity .
also , it is possible to define harmonic vector @-@ valued functions , or harmonic maps of two Riemannian manifolds , which are critical points of a generalized Dirichlet energy functional ( this includes harmonic functions as a special case , a result known as Dirichlet principle ) .
for example , a curve , that is , a map from an interval in R to a Riemannian manifold , is a harmonic map if and only if it is a Geodesic .

" Barton Fink " was influenced by several earlier works , including the films of Roman Polanski , particularly " Repulsion " ( 1965 ) and " The tenant " ( 1976 ) .
his room is sparse and draped in subdued colors ; its only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach , arm raised to block the sun .
when Barton awakens the next morning , he , again , hears the sound of the mosquito , finds it on Audrey 's back , and slaps it dead .
the final scene was shot near Zuma Beach , as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock .
in fact , we wanted the only opening on the exterior world to be this picture .
this tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film , when Barton finds himself - in a sense - inside the picture .
actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story , while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a " Künstlerroman , " highlighting the importance of the main character 's evolution as a writer .
the film begins with the end of a play , and the story explores the process of creation .
later , at one point in the picnic scene , as Mayhew wanders drunkenly away from Barton and Audrey , he calls out : " silent upon a peak in Darien !
critics have suggested that the movie indirectly references the work of writers Dante Alighieri ( through the use of " Divine Comedy " imagery ) and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ( through the presence of Faustian bargains ) .
Confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters , like those in the novels of Franz Kafka , appear in the film , but the Coens insist the connection was not intended .
Turturro was the only member of the production who read Odets ' " Journal , " however , and the Coen brothers urge audiences to " take account of the difference between the character and the man . "
" as far as the details of the character are concerned , " Ethan said in 1991 , " Mayhew is very different from Faulkner , whose experiences in Hollywood were not the same at all .
on the other hand , the world of Broadway theatre in " Barton Fink " is a place of high culture , where the creator believes most fully that his work embodies his own values .
in the film , Los Angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people .
as with Mayhew 's scripts , " Barton Fink " contains a " good wrestler " ( Barton , it seems ) and a " bad wrestler " ( Charlie ) who " confront " each other at the end .

Washington Irving ( April 3 , 1783 - November 28 , 1859 ) was an American author , essayist , biographer , historian , and diplomat of the early 19th century .
he continued to publish regularly - and almost always successfully - throughout his life , and completed a five @-@ volume biography of George Washington just eight months before his death , at age 76 , in Tarrytown , New York .
Irving , along with James Fenimore Cooper , was among the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe , and Irving encouraged American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne , Herman Melville , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , and Edgar Allan Poe .
at age six , with the help of a nanny , Irving met his namesake , who was then living in New York after his inauguration as president in 1789 .

in 1834 , he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor , who convinced Irving to write a history of his fur trading colony in the American northwest , now known as Astoria , Oregon .
in the minds of some critics , especially James Fenimore Cooper and Philip Freneau , Irving had turned his back on his American heritage in favor of English aristocracy .

it can be used to demonstrate that electrons and Atoms have intrinsically quantum properties , and how measurement in quantum mechanics affects the system being measured .
however , if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force on one end of the dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end , so that there is a net force which deflects the particle 's trajectory .
if the particles were classical spinning objects , one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be random and continuous .
each particle would be deflected by a different amount , producing some density distribution on the detector screen .
for electrons there are two possible values for the spin angular momentum that is measured along an axis .

an electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors , using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device .
to calculate the cost per kilometer of an electric vehicle it is therefore necessary to assign a monetary value to the wear incurred on the battery .

housing the motor within the wheel can increase the unsprung weight of the wheel , which can have an adverse effect on the handling of the vehicle .

Broca 's area is now typically defined in terms of the Pars opercularis and Pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus , represented in Brodmann 's cytoarchitectonic map as areas 44 and 45 of the dominant hemisphere .

studying an enzyme 's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme , its role in metabolism , how its activity is controlled , and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme .
this rate @-@ determining step may be a chemical reaction or a conformational change of the enzyme or substrates , such as those involved in the release of product ( s ) from the enzyme .
the main difference between ribozymes and enzymes is that RNA catalysts are composed of nucleotides , whereas enzymes are composed of amino acids .
knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can show how the enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions .
because enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse , enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction .
although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples ( i.e. , they are discontinuous assays ) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity .
the enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear for a short period after the start of the reaction .
Catalase is an example of this , as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate , becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate .
if the initial rate of the reaction is measured over a range of substrate concentrations ( denoted as the reaction rate ( " V " ) increases as [ S increases , as shown on the right .
being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate as well as the concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes .
this aim of predicting the behaviour of Metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms .
if a set of these measurements is performed at different fixed concentrations of A , these data can be used to work out what the mechanism of the reaction is .
the order of binding can either be random ( in a random mechanism ) or substrates have to bind in a particular sequence ( in an ordered mechanism ) .

= = Historic storm surges = = The deadliest storm surge on record was the 1970 Bhola cyclone , which killed up to 500,000 people in the area of the Bay of Bengal .
the pressure effects of a tropical cyclone will cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of low atmospheric pressure and fall in regions of high atmospheric pressure .
the rising water level will counteract the low atmospheric pressure such that the total pressure at some plane beneath the water surface remains constant .
the Earth 's rotation causes the Coriolis effect , which bends currents to the right in the Northern hemisphere and to the left in the Southern hemisphere .
powerful wind whips up large , strong waves in the direction of its movement .
although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water , they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore .
Conversely , coastlines along North America such as those along the Gulf of Mexico coast from Texas to Florida , and Asia such as the Bay of Bengal , have long , gently sloping shelves and shallow water depths .
in the Asian region , the Philippines are one of the most affected by storm surges of typhoons as it lies in the path of tradewinds @-@ entrained typhoons heading toward Japan , Taiwan , China , Vietnam , and Cambodia .
in the case of deep tropical cyclones , this is due to very low atmospheric pressure and inward swirling winds causing an uplifted dome of water to form under and travel in tandem with the storm .
when HWM are analyzed , if the various components of the water height can be broken out so that the portion attributable to surge can be identified , then that mark can be classified as storm surge .
during evaluation , HWM are divided into four categories based on the confidence in the mark ; only HWM evaluated as " excellent " are used by NHC in post storm analysis of the surge .
tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level ( MSL ) at that location , then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height .
= = SLOSH = = The National Hurricane Center in the US , forecasts storm surge using the SLOSH model , which stands for Sea , Lake and overland Surges from hurricanes .
some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin ; for instance , Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the Lake Ponchartrain / New Orleans basin , and the Mississippi Sound basin , for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall .
and for hurricane evacuation studies , a family of storms with representative tracks for the region , and varying intensity , eye diameter , and speed , are modeled to produce worst @-@ case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence .
these have been implemented , for instance , in the Netherlands , Spain , the United States , and the United Kingdom .

it doesn 't necessarily come from any actual movement of charge , but it does have an associated magnetic field , just as does a current due to charge motion .
note that : : formula _ 6 = = Necessity = = Some implications of the displacement current follow , which agree with experimental observation , and with the requirements of logical consistency for the theory of electromagnetism .
that is , in a manner described by Gauss 's law , assuming no dielectric between the plates : : formula _ 15where " S " refers to the imaginary cylindrical surface .
because the current is increasing the charge on the capacitor 's plates , the electric field between the plates is increasing , and the rate of change of electric field gives the correct value for the field B found above .
in differential form this continuity equation becomes : : formula _ 22where the left side is the divergence of the free current density and the right side is the rate of decrease of the free charge density .
the ∇ " φ " component on the right hand side is the Gauss 's law component , and this is the component that is relevant to the conservation of charge argument above .
this is in part due to the fact that Maxwell used a sea of molecular vortices in his derivation , while modern textbooks operate on the basis that displacement current can exist in free space .
the blue color of the sky is a direct result of Rayleigh scattering which redirects higher frequency ( blue ) sunlight back into the field of view of the observer .
because blue light is scattered more easily than red light , the sun takes on a reddish hue when it is observed through a thick atmosphere , as during a sunrise or sunset .
because Rainbows are seen on the opposite side of the sky as the sun , Rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon due to their greater distance apart .
he said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer .
for over 100 years , research on the Moon illusion has been conducted by vision scientists who invariably have been psychologists specializing in human perception .
this results in a red shift of the far lightsources that is compensated by the blue hue of the scattered light in the line of sight .
in other words , the red light scatters also ; if it does so at a point a great distance from the observer it has a much higher chance of reaching the observer than blue light .
dust from the Sahara moves around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge moves into the southeastern United States during the summer , which changes the sky from a blue to a white appearance and leads to an increase in red sunsets .
the sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red , orange , Pink and yellow ( especially near sunset or sunrise ) and black at night .
tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out , giving a cloud its characteristic white color , especially when viewed from the top .
as a result , the cloud base can vary from a very light to very dark grey depending on the cloud 's thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer .
in the visible spectrum , blue and green are at the short end of light 's visible wavelengths , while red and yellow are at the long end .
a cumulonimbus cloud emitting green is a sign that it is a severe thunderstorm , capable of heavy rain , hail , strong winds and possible tornadoes .
Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels .

the double @-@ slit experiment ( and its variations ) has become a classic thought experiment , for its clarity in expressing the central puzzles of quantum mechanics .
" Feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment .
it should be noted that only the intensity of a light field can be measured - this is proportional to the square of the amplitude .

the three @-@ dimensional solutions of the Helmholtz equation can be expressed as expansions in spherical harmonics with coefficients proportional to the spherical Bessel functions .
in spherical coordinates the solutions to the wave equation can be written as follows : : formula _ 48 : formula _ 49and : formula _ 50 : formula _ 51These can be rewritten in terms of the spherical Bessel function .
however , according to Maxwell 's equations , the charges in the conductor experience a magnetic force in the frame of the magnet and an electric force in the frame of the conductor .
likewise , the solenoidal portion of electric fields ( the portion that is not originated by electric charges ) becomes a magnetic field in another frame : that is , the solenoidal electric fields and magnetic fields are aspects of the same thing .
an alternative unification of descriptions is to think of the physical entity as the electromagnetic field tensor , as described later on .
a strong requirement in physics is that all observers of the motion of a particle agree on the trajectory of the particle .
perhaps the simplest example , and one that Einstein referenced in his 1905 paper introducing special relativity , is the problem of a conductor moving in the field of a magnet .
the magnetic field in the magnet frame and the electric field in the conductor frame must generate consistent results in the conductor .
as a byproduct , this argument will " also " yield a general formula for the electric and magnetic fields in one frame in terms of the fields in another frame .
= = = magnet frame = = = In the rest frame of the magnet , the magnetic field is some fixed field B ( R ) , determined by the structure and shape of the magnet .
( the Ampere @-@ Maxwell equation also comes into play , explaining how , in the conductor 's frame , this moving electric field will contribute to the magnetic field .
assuming a Lorentz transformation , invariance of Maxwell 's equations then leads to the above transformation of the fields for this example .
so the force on the charge is not the same in both frames , but it transforms as expected according to relativity .
here , formula _ 25 is " c " times the proper time of the particle and formula _ 26 is the Minkowski metric tensor .

in this notion , a fixed initial state of a macroscopic system corresponds to relatively low entropy because the coordinates of the molecules of the body are constrained .
one can , however equally well imagine a state of the universe in which the motions of all of the particles at one instant were the reverse ( strictly , the CPT reverse ) .
one position is to say that the constant increase of entropy we observe happens " only " because of the initial state of our universe .
other possible states of the universe ( for example , a universe at heat death equilibrium ) would actually result in no increase of entropy .
in this view , the apparent T @-@ asymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology : why did the universe start with a low entropy ?

physical processes at the microscopic level are believed to be either entirely or mostly time @-@ symmetric : if the direction of time were to reverse , the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true .
yet at the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case : there is an obvious direction ( or " flow " ) of time .
the thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the Second Law of Thermodynamics , which says that in an isolated system , entropy tends to increase with time .
Alternatively , it may be an artifact of our place in the universe 's evolution ( see the Anthropic bias ) , with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a Big crunch .
if this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time , then the future is " by definition " the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger .
an epistemological problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that , as David Hume maintained , the causal relation per se cannot be perceived ; one only perceives sequences of events .
however , it does seem evident that dropping a cup of water is a cause while the cup subsequently shattering and spilling the water is the effect .
physically speaking , the perception of cause and effect in the dropped cup example is a phenomenon of the thermodynamic arrow of time , a consequence of the Second law of thermodynamics .

the Adm formalism , named for its authors Richard Arnowitt , Stanley Deser and Charles W. Misner , is a Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity that plays an important role in quantum gravity and numerical relativity .
the dynamic variables of this theory are taken to be the metric tensor of three dimensional spatial slices formula _ 4 and their conjugate momenta formula _ 5 .
using these variables it is possible to define a Hamiltonian , and thereby write the equations of motion for general relativity in the form of Hamilton 's equations .
in addition to the twelve variables formula _ 6 and formula _ 7 , there are four Lagrange multipliers : the lapse function , formula _ 8 , and components of shift vector field , formula _ 9 .
the equations of motion for these variables can be freely specified ; this freedom corresponds to the freedom to specify how to lay out the coordinate system in space and time .

to add another electron to a given volume requires raising an electron 's energy level to make room , and this requirement for energy to compress the material manifests as a pressure .
matter is electron degenerate when the density ( proportional to formula _ 8 ) is high enough , and the temperature low enough , that the sum is dominated by the degeneracy pressure .
when the pressure due to this " Heisenberg motion " exceeds that of the pressure from the thermal motions of the electrons , the electrons are referred to as degenerate , and the material is termed degenerate matter .
Electron degeneracy pressure will halt the gravitational collapse of a star if its mass is below the Chandrasekhar limit ( 1.44 solar masses ) .
for crystals under such conditions , the Debye model , an extension of the Einstein theory that accounts for statistical distributions in atomic vibration when there are lower amounts of energy to distribute , works well .
the effective temperature of a star indicates the amount of heat that the star radiates per unit of surface area .
an albedo of 1 means that all the radiation is reflected , an albedo of 0 means all of it is absorbed .
the area of the planet that absorbs the power from the star is Aabs which is some fraction of the total surface area formula _ 8 , where R is the radius of the planet .
an albedo of 1 means that all the radiation is reflected , an albedo of 0 means all of it is absorbed .
one reason for the difference between the two values is due to the greenhouse effect , which increases the average temperature of the Earth 's surface .
Confusingly , the term " Fermi energy " is often used to refer to a different but closely related concept , the Fermi " level " ( also called electrochemical potential ) .
there are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy , at least as they are used in this article : * The Fermi energy is only defined at absolute zero , while the Fermi level is defined for any temperature .
* The Fermi energy is an energy " difference " ( usually corresponding to a kinetic energy ) , whereas the Fermi level is a total energy level including kinetic energy and potential energy .
to find the ground state of the whole system , we start with an empty system , and add particles one at a time , consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy .
when all the particles have been put in , the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state .

Suppose now that instead of one particle in this box we have N particles in the box and that these particles are fermions with spin 1 / 2 .
let us now consider a three @-@ dimensional cubical box that has a side length " L " ( see infinite square well ) .
so the Fermi energy of a nucleus is about : : : formula _ 37The radius of the nucleus admits deviations around the value mentioned above , so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 MeV .

= = = Observational frames of reference = = = An observational frame of reference , often referred to as a " physical frame of reference , " a " frame of reference , " or simply a " frame , " is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer 's state of motion .
here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve : an observational frame of reference is characterized " only by its state of motion . "
in special relativity , the distinction is sometimes made between an " observer " and a " frame . "
this restricted view is not used here , and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity .
in general relativity the use of general coordinate systems is common ( see , for example , the Schwarzschild solution for the gravitational field outside an isolated sphere ) .
in physics experiments , the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the laboratory frame or simply " lab frame .
in order to catch up to the first car , it will take a time of , that is , 25 seconds , as before .
the measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer 's frame of reference ( you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three , when in fact it arrived at three ) .
in his frame of reference , Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin , the road as the x @-@ axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y @-@ axis .
to him , the car moves along the " x " axis with some velocity " V " in the positive x @-@ direction .
Betsy , in choosing her frame of reference , defines her location as the origin , the direction to her right as the positive " x " -axis , and the direction in front of her as the positive " y " -axis .
if she is driving north , then north is the positive " y " -direction ; if she turns east , east becomes the positive " y " -direction .
if Betsy 's velocity " V " is constant , she is in an inertial frame of reference , and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference , " a " in the negative " y " -direction .
frames of reference are especially important in special relativity , because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light , then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame .
Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another .
that is , there exists a " universal " time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity .
in a similar way , it is now common to describe that we exist in a four @-@ dimensional geometry known as spacetime .
an accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the " primed " frame , and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes , e.g.
seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force ( either in centrifugal direction , or in a direction orthogonal to an object 's motion , the Coriolis effect ) .
a common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating ( an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried ) .

he authored the new concept of activity of the Galactic Nuclei ( cores , central condensations ) , to have a decisive role in the genesis and evolution of the galaxies and their systems .
owing to that vision , the study of the grand scale non @-@ stationary phenomena , observed in the galaxies became the central subject of the extra @-@ Galaxy astronomy .
= = = Active Galactic nucleus ( AGN ) = = = It was in the early 1950s when Prof. Victor Ambartsumian first raised the issue of the Activity of Nuclei of galaxies ( AGN ) .
it was proposed by Ambartsumian more than half a century ago and was recognized by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences as revolutionary , on a copernican scale .
as well as her own experiments and research , she is often asked to speak at International Conferences , and is involved in structuring the science policies of various institutions .
for her doctoral studies in quantum theory HAU worked on ideas similar to those involved in fibre optic cables carrying light , but her work involved strings of Atoms in a silicon crystal carrying electrons .
her formalized training is in theoretical physics but her interest moved to experimental research in an effort to create a new form of matter known as a Bose @-@ Einstein condensate .
in Sept . 1999 she was appointed the Gordon Mckay Professor of Applied Physics and Professor of Physics at Harvard .
the experiment relies on the way that , according to quantum mechanics , Atoms may behave as waves as well as particles .
they then launched this millimeter @-@ long atomic cloud towards a suspended carbon nanotube , located some two centimeters away and charged to hundreds of volts .
if you see all the stars whirling around you , Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a centrifugal force .
it has been proposed that they emit black @-@ body radiation ( called Hawking radiation ) , with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole .
the spectrum is peaked at a characteristic frequency that shifts to higher frequencies with increasing temperature , and at room temperature most of the emission is in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum .
because of its high temperature , the Sun emits to a large extent in the ultraviolet and visible ( UV @-@ Vis ) frequency range .
in this frequency range , the planet reflects a fraction formula _ 31 of this energy where formula _ 31 is the albedo or reflectance of the planet in the UV @-@ Vis range .
this temperature , calculated for the case of the planet acting as a black body by setting formula _ 38 , is known as the effective temperature .
ignoring the atmosphere and greenhouse effect , the planet , since it is at a much lower temperature than the Sun , emits mostly in the infrared ( IR ) portion of the spectrum .
in this frequency range , it emits formula _ 39 of the radiation that a black body would emit where formula _ 39 is the average emissivity in the IR range .
prior to this time , most matter in the universe was in the form of an ionized plasma in thermal equilibrium with radiation .
aircraft use the wing area ( or rotor @-@ blade area ) as the reference area , which makes for an easy comparison to lift .
first developed in the 1970s , fiber @-@ optic communication systems have revolutionized the telecommunications industry and have played a major role in the advent of the Information Age .
after a period of research starting from 1975 , the first commercial fiber @-@ optic communications system was developed , which operated at a wavelength around 0.8 µm and used GaAs semiconductor lasers .
they were used at that time for the transmission of television channels , not available because of local reception problems .
by 1987 , these systems were operating at bit rates of up to 1.7 Gb / s with repeater spacing up to 50 km .
third @-@ generation fiber @-@ optic systems operated at 1.55 µm and had losses of about 0.2 dB / km .
the conventional wavelength window , known as the C band , covers the wavelength range 1.53 @-@ 1.57 µm , and " dry fiber " has a low @-@ loss window promising an extension of that range to 1.30 @-@ 1.65 µm .
for use in optical communications , semiconductor optical transmitters must be designed to be compact , efficient , and reliable , while operating in an optimal wavelength range , and directly modulated at high frequencies .
however , due to their relatively simple design , LEDs are very useful for low @-@ cost applications .
because InGaAsP LEDs operate at a longer wavelength than GaAs LEDs ( 1.3 micrometers vs. 0.81 @-@ 0.87 micrometers ) , their output spectrum , while equivalent in energy is wider in wavelength terms by a factor of about 1.7 .
a semiconductor laser emits light through stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission , which results in high output power ( ~ 100 mW ) as well as other benefits related to the nature of coherent light .
commonly used classes of semiconductor laser transmitters used in fiber optics include VCSEL ( vertical @-@ cavity Surface @-@ Emitting Laser ) , Fabry @-@ Pérot and DFB ( distributed feed Back ) .
Laser diodes are often directly modulated , that is the light output is controlled by a current applied directly to the device .
however , a multi @-@ mode fiber introduces multimode distortion , which often limits the bandwidth and length of the link .
because of the high complexity with modern wavelength @-@ division multiplexed signals ( including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km ) , the cost of these repeaters is very high .
an alternative approach is to use an optical amplifier , which amplifies the optical signal directly without having to convert the signal into the electrical domain .
this value is a product of bandwidth and distance because there is a trade off between the bandwidth of the signal and the distance it can be carried .
dispersion limits the bandwidth of the fiber because the spreading optical pulse limits the rate that pulses can follow one another on the fiber and still be distinguishable at the receiver .
in Europe , and among telcos in the United States , BPON ( ATM @-@ based Broadband PON ) and GPON ( Gigabit PON ) had roots in the FSAN ( Full Service Access Network ) and ITU @-@ T standards organizations under their control .
because of these benefits of electrical transmission , optical communication is not common in short box @-@ to @-@ box , backplane , or chip @-@ to @-@ chip applications ; however , optical systems on those scales have been demonstrated in the laboratory .
the Compton wavelength of a particle is equivalent to the wavelength of a photon whose energy is the same as the rest @-@ mass energy of the particle .
the non @-@ reduced Compton wavelength for this particle is the wavelength of a photon of the same energy .
the Compton wavelength can be contrasted with the de Broglie wavelength , which depends on the momentum of a particle and determines the cutoff between particle and wave behavior in quantum mechanics .
this special distance is called the Planck length ( formula _ 20 ) .
this means the particle spends most of its time at the bottom of the potential well , as we would expect for a state with little energy .
this is the simplest quantum mechanical model of a lattice , and we will see how phonons arise from it .
Corpuscles are single , infinitesimally small , particles which have shape , size , color , and other physical properties which alter their functions and effects in phenomena in the mechanical and biological sciences .

this is in contrast to diabetes mellitus type 1 , in which there is an absolute lack of insulin due to breakdown of islet cells in the pancreas .
while some of these factors are under personal control , such as diet and obesity , other factors are not , such as increasing age , female gender , and genetics .
the type of fats in the diet are also important , with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk , and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk .
the TCF7L2 allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants .
there are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as monogenic forms of diabetes or " other specific types of diabetes " ) .
Insulin resistance , which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin , occurs primarily within the muscles , liver , and fat tissue .
in those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or acarbose may decrease the risk of developing diabetes .
the five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are India having 31.7 million , China 20.8 million , the United States 17.7 million , Indonesia 8.4 million , and Japan 6.8 million .
type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400 @-@ 500 AD with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight .
effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922 .

in fact , the quantity called " voltage " as measured in an electronic circuit has a simple relationship to the chemical potential for electrons ( Fermi level ) .
if there is a state at the Fermi level ( " ϵ " = " µ " ) , then this state will have a 50 % chance of being occupied at any given time .
for this reason it is common to focus on the value of " ζ " when concentrating on the properties of electrons in a single , homogeneous conductive material .
when the device is brought out of equilibrium and put into use , then strictly speaking the Fermi level and temperature are no longer well defined .
it also has the advantage of being accessible , so that the Fermi level of any other object can be measured simply with a voltmeter .
the source of this vacuum potential variation is the variation in work function between the different conducting materials exposed to vacuum .
as the force due to the interaction of electric charges falls off rapidly with increasing distance , the effect of the closer ( opposite polarity ) charges is greater and the two objects feel a force of attraction .
this process is integral to the workings of the Van de Graaff generator , a device commonly used to demonstrate the effects of static electricity .
the energy stored as static electricity on an object varies depending on the size of the object and its capacitance , the voltage to which it is charged , and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium .
while the total energy is small , on the order of millijoules , it can still damage sensitive electronic devices .
in the petrochemical industry , 50 pS / m is the recommended minimum value of electrical Conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid .
as little as 0.2 millijoules may present an ignition hazard ; such low spark energy is often below the threshold of human visual and auditory perception .

= = T @-@ symmetry and self @-@ interaction = = One of the major results of the absorber theory is the elegant and clear interpretation of the electromagnetic radiation process .
this apparent problem however can be solved in the absorber theory , by observing that the equation of motion for the particle has to be solved together with the Maxwell equations for the field .

each is specified by a choice of the function " K " of two variables , the kernel function or nucleus of the transform .
also there are many applications of probability that rely on integral transforms , such as " pricing kernel " or stochastic discount factor , or the smoothing of data recovered from robust statistics , see kernel ( statistics ) .
this is a technique that maps differential or integro @-@ differential equations in the " time " domain into polynomial equations in what is termed the " complex frequency " domain .
for example , every integral transform is a linear operator , since the integral is a linear operator , and in fact if the kernel is allowed to be a generalized function then all linear operators are integral transforms ( a properly formulated version of this statement is the Schwartz kernel theorem ) .

the first Einstein ring corresponds to the most distorted region of the picture and is clearly depicted by the Galactic disc .
in mathematics , a constant function is a function whose ( output ) value is the same for every input value .
for example , the function formula _ 1 is a constant function because the value of formula _ 2 is 4 regardless of the input value formula _ 3 ( see image ) .
= = Basic properties = = As a real @-@ valued function of a real @-@ valued argument , a constant function has the general form formula _ 4 or just formula _ 5 .
for stars that lie near the plane of the Milky Way and are within a few thousand parsecs of the Earth , extinction in the V band is on the order of 1.8 magnitudes per kiloparsec .
in the solar neighborhood , the rate of interstellar extinction in the Johnson @-@ cousins V @-@ band is usually taken to be 0.7 @-@ 1.0 mag / KPC − simply an average due to the " clumpiness " of interstellar dust .
in general , however , this means that a star will have its brightness reduced by about a factor of 2 in the V @-@ band for every kiloparsec it is further away from us .
for our own Galaxy , the Milky Way , the typical value for R ( V ) is 3.1 , but is found to be between 2.5 and 6 for different lines of sight .
it is also possible to use a theoretical spectrum instead of the observed spectrum for the comparison , but this is less common .
a ratio other than 2.85 must therefore be due to extinction , and the amount of extinction can thus be calculated .
in the Local Group , the best @-@ determined extinction curves are those of the Milky Way , the Small Magellanic cloud ( SMC ) and the Large Magellanic cloud ( LMC ) .
this gives clues as to the composition of the ISM in the various galaxies .
the most important sources of telluric absorption are molecular oxygen and ozone , which absorb strongly in the near @-@ ultraviolet , and water , which absorbs strongly in the infrared .
the amount of atmospheric extinction depends on the altitude of an object , being lowest at the zenith and at a maximum near the horizon .
Radio galaxies and their relatives , radio @-@ loud quasars and blazars , are types of active Galaxy that are very luminous at radio wavelengths , with luminosities up to 1039 W between 10 MHz and 100 GHz .
a sister process to the synchrotron radiation is the inverse @-@ Compton process , in which the relativistic electrons interact with ambient photons and Thomson scatter them to high energies .
Synchrotron radiation is not confined to radio wavelengths : if the radio source can accelerate particles to high enough energies , features that are detected in the radio wavelengths may also be seen in the infrared , optical , ultraviolet or even X @-@ ray .
since the 1970s , the most widely accepted model has been that the lobes or plumes are powered by " beams " of high @-@ energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus .
FRIIs appear to be able to transport energy efficiently to the ends of the lobes , while FRI beams are inefficient in the sense that they radiate a significant amount of their energy away as they travel .
in more detail , the FRI / FRII division depends on host @-@ Galaxy environment in the sense that the FRI / FRII transition appears at higher luminosities in more massive galaxies .
in the case of sources with lobes , the dynamics are fairly simple : the jets feed the lobes , the pressure of the lobes increases , and the lobes expand .
Seyfert galaxies form a substantial fraction of the galaxies appearing in the Markarian catalog , a list of galaxies displaying an ultraviolet excess in their Nuclei .
= = characteristics = = An active Galactic nucleus ( AGN ) is a compact region at the center of a Galaxy that has a higher than normal luminosity over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum .
active Galactic Nuclei are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe , and their evolution puts constraints on cosmological models .
the two largest subclasses of active galaxies are quasars and Seyfert galaxies , the main difference between the two being the amount of radiation they emit .
= = = Eddington luminosity = = = A lower limit to the mass of the central black hole can be calculated using the Eddington luminosity .
= = = emissions = = = The emission lines seen on the spectrum of a Seyfert Galaxy may come from the surface of the accretion disc itself , or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone .
the exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the Galactic center .
for 35 AGN , reverberation mapping has been used to calculate the mass of the central black holes and the size of the broad line regions .
the spectra of some of these galaxies have changed from Type 1.5 to Type II in a matter of a few years .
by contrast , in Type II Seyfert galaxies , the active Nuclei are obscured and only the colder outer regions located further away from the clouds ' broad line emission region are seen .
they have two sets of emission lines on their spectra : narrow lines with widths ( measured in velocity units ) of several hundred km / s , and broad lines with widths up to 104 km / s .
the broad lines originate above the accretion disc of the supermassive black hole thought to power the Galaxy , while the narrow lines occur beyond the broad line region of the accretion disc .
when the Galaxy is viewed from the side , the nucleus is indirectly observed through reflection by gas and dust above and below the torus .
in Type 1.8 , very weak broad lines can be detected in the Hβ lines as well as Hα , even if they are very weak compared to the Hα .
very similar to Seyferts are the low @-@ ionisation narrow @-@ line emission radio galaxies ( liner ) , discovered in 1980 .
some observations suggest that AGN emission from the nucleus is not spherically symmetric and that the nucleus often shows axial symmetry , with radiation escaping in a conical region .
based on this observations , models have been devised to explain the different classes of AGNs as due to their different orientations with respect to the observational line of sight .
unified models explain the difference between Seyfert I and Seyfert II galaxies as being the result of Seyfert II galaxies being surrounded by obscuring toruses which prevent us from seeing the broad line region .

when a portion of a molecular cloud reaches a critical size , mass , or density , it begins to collapse under its own gravity .
as this collapsing cloud , called a solar nebula , becomes denser , random gas motions originally present in the cloud average out in favor of the direction of the nebula 's net angular momentum .
this process competes against the stellar wind , which drives the gas out of the system , and gravity ( accretion ) , which pulls material into the central T Tauri star .

they also cause many chemical and physical changes in the target by transferring their energy and momentum to the electrons and atomic Nuclei of the target material .
because the ions have masses comparable to those of the target Atoms , they knock the target Atoms out of place more than electron beams do .
however , there is often great structural damage to the target , and because the depth distribution is broad ( Bragg peak ) , the net composition change at any point in the target will be small .
thus , Ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target .
Dopant ions such as boron , phosphorus or arsenic are generally created from a gas source , so that the purity of the source can be very high .
= = = Sputtering = = = Some of the collision events result in Atoms being ejected ( sputtered ) from the surface , and thus Ion implantation will slowly etch away a surface .
the result is that the range of an Ion can be much longer if the Ion travels exactly along a particular direction , for example the < 110 > direction in silicon and other diamond cubic materials .

in physics , the Schrödinger picture ( also called the Schrödinger representation ) is a formulation of quantum mechanics in which the state vectors evolve in time , but the operators ( observables and others ) are constant with respect to time .
for example , a quantum harmonic oscillator may be in a state formula _ 9 for which the expectation value of the momentum , formula _ 13 , oscillates sinusoidally in time .
all three of these choices are valid ; the first gives the Schrödinger picture , the second the Heisenberg picture , and the third the interaction picture .
the alternative to the Schrödinger picture is to switch to a rotating reference frame , which is itself being rotated by the propagator .

note that in the hadronic sector there are some intriguing open questions and some effects considered anomalies within the Standard Model .
for example , four very important open questions are the proton spin puzzle , the EMC effect , the distributions of electric charges inside the nucleons as found by Hofstadter in 1956 , and the ad hoc CKM matrix elements .
these were organized into relationships on their physical properties in a largely ad @-@ hoc system of hierarchies , not entirely unlike the way taxonomy grouped animals based on their physical features .
the particles being seen in the ever @-@ more @-@ powerful accelerators were , according to the theory , typically nothing more than combinations of these quarks .
based on these rules , the preon models try to explain the Standard Model , often predicting small discrepancies with this model and generating new particles and certain phenomena , which do not belong to the Standard Model .
many of the preon models theorize that the apparent imbalance of matter and antimatter in the universe is in fact illusory , with large quantities of preon level antimatter confined within more complex structures .
many preon models either do not account for the Higgs boson or rule it out , and propose that electro @-@ weak symmetry is broken not by a scalar Higgs field but by composite preons .

hence , the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area ( directly facing the point source ) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source .
if the distribution of matter in each body is spherically symmetric , then the objects can be treated as point masses without approximation , as shown in the shell theorem .
however , if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their sizes , then to a good approximation , it is reasonable to treat the masses as point mass while calculating the gravitational force .
if you are close to the origin , you don 't have to go far to double the radius , so the signal drops quickly .

although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height , Hooke argued that the air 's pressure at the earth 's surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude .
although Hooke did not explicitly state so , the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the earth 's center .

the equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body .
since the object 's velocity vector is constantly changing direction , the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation .
= = uniform circular motion = = In physics , uniform circular motion describes the motion of a body traversing a circular path at constant speed .
this acceleration is , in turn , produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation .
although the object has a constant " speed , " its " direction " is always changing .
here is an example with an object traveling in a straight path then loops a loop back into a straight path again .
the normal force is actually the sum of the radial and tangential forces that help to counteract the weight force and contribute to the centripetal force .
the vertical component of the normal force is what counteracts the weight of the object .
in non @-@ uniform circular motion , normal force and weight may point in the same direction .
both forces can point down , yet the object will remain in a circular path without falling straight down .
in the first diagram , let 's say the object is a person sitting inside a plane , the two forces point down only when it reaches the top of the circle .
from a logical standpoint , a person who is traveling in the plane will be Upside down at the top of the circle .
once an object is thrown into the air , there is only the downward force of earth 's gravity that acts on the object .
that does not mean that once an object is thrown in the air , it will fall instantly .
although there are additional forces acting upon the object , the sum of all the forces acting on the object will have to equal to the centripetal force .
since the sum of all forces is the centripetal force , drawing centripetal force into a free body diagram is not necessary and usually not recommended .
for example , the visual above showing an object at the top of a semicircle would be expressed as formula _ 69 .
in uniform circular motion , total acceleration of an object in a circular path is equal to the radial acceleration .

another line of research has been to dramatically improve efficiency through the multi @-@ junction approach , although these cells are very high cost and suitable only for large commercial deployments .
in general terms the types of cells suitable for rooftop deployment have not changed significantly in efficiency , although costs have dropped somewhat due to increased supply .
as in a conventional alkaline battery , an anode ( the titanium dioxide ) and a cathode ( the platinum ) are placed on either side of a liquid conductor ( the electrolyte ) .
after flowing through the external circuit , they are re @-@ introduced into the cell on a metal electrode on the back , flowing into the electrolyte .
finally , in order to understand the underlying physics , the " quantum efficiency " is used to compare the chance that one photon ( of a particular energy ) will create one electron .
the quantum efficiency of traditional designs vary , depending on their thickness , but are about the same as the DSSC .
these factors limit the current generated by a DSSC , for comparison , a traditional silicon @-@ based solar cell offers about 35 MA / cm2 , whereas current DSSCs offer about 20 MA / cm2 .
they may not be as attractive for large @-@ scale deployments where higher @-@ cost higher @-@ efficiency cells are more viable , but even small increases in the DSSC conversion efficiency might make them suitable for some of these roles as well .
a third major drawback is that the electrolyte solution contains volatile organic compounds ( or VOC 's ) , solvents which must be carefully sealed as they are hazardous to human health and the environment .
the energy conversion efficiency of the device is 1.91 % , which exceeds the efficiency of its individual components , but is still much lower than that of high performance n @-@ DSC devices ( 6 % -11 % ) .

a Majorana fermion ( ) , also referred to as a Majorana particle , is a fermion that is its own antiparticle .
the term is sometimes used in opposition to a Dirac fermion , which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles .
Majorana fermions can be bound to a defect at zero energy , and then the combined objects are called Majorana bound states or Majorana zero modes .
this name is more appropriate than Majorana fermion ( although the distinction is not always made in the literature ) , because the statistics of these objects is no longer fermionic .
the primordial helium in the Universe experienced the same phase changes , but at different points in the history of the Universe , and is usually referred to as helium reionization .
this means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines , a quasar 's light which has traveled through a large , spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a Gunn @-@ Peterson trough .
however , as the Universe expands , the density of free electrons will decrease , and scattering will occur less frequently .
in the period during and after reionization , but before significant expansion had occurred to sufficiently lower the electron density , the light that composes the CMB will experience observable Thomson scattering .
this is in the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum , which means that the primary candidates are all sources which produce a significant amount of energy in the ultraviolet and above .
" with these constraints , it is expected that quasars and first generation stars and galaxies were the main sources of energy .
thus , every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space , so that an object must be either in a state of absolute rest , or moving at some absolute speed .
the theory of relativity does not allow the existence of absolute time because of the nonexistence of absolute simultaneity .
the theory of relativity postulates a maximum rate of transmission of information as the speed of light , and one consequence is that simultaneity at separated locations always is relative to the observer .

a theoretical efficiency of 50 % is obtainable with transformer output coupling and only 25 % with capacitive coupling , unless deliberate use of nonlinearities is made ( such as in square @-@ law output stages ) .
inefficiency comes from the standing current that must be roughly half the maximum output current , and a large part of the power supply voltage is present across the output device at low signal levels .
an improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they 're not in use .
in class @-@ AB operation , each device operates the same way as in class B over half the waveform , but also conducts a small amount on the other half .
when the transistor is on , it pushes through the serial LC circuit into the load and some current begins to flow to the parallel LC circuit to ground .
class F can be driven by sine or by a square wave , for a sine the input can be tuned by an inductor to increase gain .

Pingos in these areas also form in the more common way , on flat ground in old lake basins when the water is too shallow to prevent permafrost .
the base of the pingo tends to reach its maximum diameter in its early youth .
pore water is expelled in front of the rising permafrost , and the resulting pressure causes the frozen ground to rise and an ice core to form .
the shape and size of a hydrostatic or closed system pingo is often similar to the body of water that it originated from .

a would @-@ be theory that makes no observable predictions is not a scientific theory at all .
the strength of the evidence is evaluated by the scientific community , and the most important experiments will have been replicated by multiple independent groups .
like all knowledge in science , no theory can ever be completely certain , since it is possible that future experiments might conflict with the theory 's predictions .
after the changes , the accepted theory will explain more phenomena and have greater predictive power ( if it did not , the changes would not be adopted ) ; this new explanation will then be open to further replacement or modification .
this also means that accepted theories continue to accumulate evidence over time , and the length of time that a theory ( or any of its principles ) remains accepted often indicates the strength of its supporting evidence .
for example , physical theories in the 19th century implied that the Sun could not have been burning long enough to allow certain geological changes as well as the evolution of life .
the phenomena explained by the theories , if they could not be directly observed by the senses ( for example , Atoms and radio waves ) , were treated as theoretical concepts .
one can use language to describe a model ; however , the theory is the model ( or a collection of similar models ) , and not the description of the model .
a model of the solar system , for example , might consist of abstract objects that represent the sun and the planets .
the model parameters , e.g. , Newton 's Law of Gravitation , determine how the positions and velocities change with time .

the superposition principle applies to " any " linear system , including algebraic equations , linear differential equations , and systems of equations of those forms .
for example , in electromagnetic theory , ordinary light is described as a superposition of plane waves ( waves of fixed frequency , polarization , and direction ) .
the value of this parameter is called the amplitude of the wave , and the wave itself is a function specifying the amplitude at each point .
that means that the net amplitude caused by two or more waves traversing the same space is the sum of the amplitudes which would have been produced by the individual waves separately .

it was proposed by John Bardeen , Leon Cooper , and John Robert Schrieffer ( " BCS " ) in 1957 ; they received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this theory in 1972 .
John Bardeen then argued in the 1955 paper , " Theory of the Meissner Effect in superconductors , " that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap .
these effects are still not yet fully understood ; it is possible that they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials .
the BCS theory , however , requires only that the potential be attractive , regardless of its origin .
in this " condensed " state , the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron , or a single pair .
in the normal state of a metal , electrons move independently , whereas in the BCS state , they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction .
this helped to support the idea of bound particles - specifically electron pairs - and together with the above helped to paint a general picture of paired electrons and their lattice interactions .
BCS theory relates the value of the critical field at zero temperature to the value of the transition temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level .
a Schwarzschild black hole or static black hole is a black hole that has no charge or angular momentum .
a Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric , and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass .
the Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by a surrounding spherical surface , called the event horizon , which is situated at the Schwarzschild radius , often called the radius of a black hole .
for example , the Schwarzschild radius " R " " s " of the Earth is roughly , while the Sun , which is 3.3 × 105 times as massive has a Schwarzschild radius of approximately .
in Schwarzschild 's original paper , he put what we now call the event horizon at the origin of his coordinate system .
in this paper he also introduced what is now known as the Schwarzschild radial coordinate ( " R " in the equations above ) , as an auxiliary variable .
in his equations , Schwarzschild was using a different radial coordinate that was zero at the Schwarzschild radius .
later , in 1932 , Georges Lemaître gave a different coordinate transformation ( Lemaître coordinates ) to the same effect and was the first to recognize that this implied that the singularity at " R " = " R " s was not physical .
in 1950 , John Synge produced a paper that showed the maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild metric , again showing that the singularity at " R " = " R " s was a coordinate artifact and that it represented two horizons .
if one asks that the solution be valid for all " R " one runs into a true physical singularity , or " gravitational singularity , " at the origin .
to see that this is a true singularity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of coordinates .

these solutions were proposed by Kerr and Schild in 1965 . : formula _ 9 : formula _ 10 : formula _ 11 : formula _ 12Notice that K is a unit vector .
in this form of solution , units are selected so that the speed of light is unity ( " c " = 1 ) .

the Kerr @-@ Newman solution ( with cosmological constant equal to zero ) is also a special case of more general exact solutions of the Einstein @-@ Maxwell Equations .
thus , a Kerr @-@ Newman source is different from commonly observed astronomical bodies , for which there is a substantial angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment .
although it represents a generalization of the Kerr metric , it is not considered as very important for astrophysical purposes since one does not expect that realistic black holes have an important electric charge .
the Russian theorist Alexander Burinskii wrote in 2007 : " in this work we obtain an exact correspondence between the wave function of the Dirac equation and the spinor ( twistorial ) structure of the Kerr geometry .
this complex potential was discussed as early as the nineteenth century , by the French mathematician Paul Émile Appell .
this plays an essential role in several physical phenomena , such as the nuclear fusion that occurs in main sequence stars like the Sun .
it has important applications to modern devices such as the tunnel diode , quantum computing , and the scanning tunnelling microscope .
pure quantum mechanical concepts are central to the phenomenon , so quantum tunnelling is one of the novel implications of quantum mechanics .
= = History = = quantum tunnelling was developed from the study of radioactivity , which was discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel .
Friedrich Hund was the first to take notice of tunnelling in 1927 when he was calculating the ground state of the double @-@ well potential .
its first application was a mathematical explanation for Alpha decay , which was done in 1928 by George Gamow and independently by Ronald Gurney and Edward Condon .
in quantum mechanics , these particles can , with a very small probability , " tunnel " to the other side , thus crossing the barrier .
the reason for this difference comes from the treatment of matter in quantum mechanics as having properties of waves and particles .
using mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics , such as the Schrödinger equation , the wave function can be solved .
for both cases , medium A is a region of space where the particle 's total energy is greater than its potential energy and medium B is the potential barrier .
when M ( x ) is constant and negative , then the Schrödinger equation can be written in the form : formula _ 4The solutions of this equation represent traveling waves , with phase @-@ constant + " K " or - " K . "

= = = The WKB approximation = = = The wave function is expressed as the exponential of a function : : formula _ 6 , where formula _ 7formula _ 8 is then separated into real and imaginary parts : : formula _ 9 , where A ( x ) and B ( x ) are real @-@ valued functions .
substituting the second equation into the first and using the fact that the imaginary part needs to be 0 results in : : formula _ 10 .
away from the potential hill , the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave ; beneath the potential hill , the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude .

in mathematical physics , equations of motion are equations that describe the behaviour of a physical system in terms of its motion as a function of time .
if the dynamics of a system is known , the equations are the solutions to the differential equations describing the motion of the dynamics .
in this instance , sometimes the term refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies ( e.g. , Newton 's second law or Euler @-@ Lagrange equations ) , and sometimes to the solutions to those equations .
it is customary to use " θ , " but this does not have to be the polar angle used in polar coordinate systems .
two have already been discussed above , in the cases that either the radial components or the angular components are zero , and the non @-@ zero component of motion describes uniform acceleration .
in chemistry , IUPAC established standard temperature and pressure ( informally abbreviated as STP ) as a temperature of 273.15 K ( 0 ° C , 32 ° F ) and an absolute pressure of exactly 100 KPA ( 1 bar , 14.5 PSI , 0.9869 ATM ) .
an unofficial , but commonly used standard is standard ambient temperature and pressure ( SATP ) as a temperature of 298.15 K ( 25 ° C , 77 ° F ) and an absolute pressure of exactly 100 KPA ( 14.504 PSI , 0.987 ATM ) .
= = = Current use = = = Many different definitions of standard reference conditions are currently being used by organizations all over the world .
for example , IUPAC has , since 1982 , defined standard reference conditions as being 0 ° C and 100 KPA ( 1 bar ) , in contrast to its old standard of 0 ° C and 101.325 KPA ( 1 ATM ) .
also , the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) each have more than one definition of standard reference conditions in their various standards and regulations .
stating the molar volume of a gas without indicating the reference conditions of temperature and pressure has very little meaning and can cause confusion .
the relationship between the two constants is RS = R / M , where M is the molecular weight of the gas .
= = Early years = = In 1901 , Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford discovered that radioactivity was part of the process by which Atoms changed from one kind to another , involving the release of energy .
but " Soddy also saw that atomic energy could possibly be used to create terrible new weapons . "
the concept of a nuclear chain reaction was hypothesized in 1933 , shortly after the discovery of the neutron .
one science writer , David Dietz , wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week , you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill .
= = World War II = = The phrase " Atomic Age " was coined by William L. Laurence , a New York Times journalist who became the official journalist for the Manhattan Project which developed the first nuclear weapons .
he witnessed both the Trinity test and the bombing of Nagasaki and went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon .
his reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and in part motivated development of the technology in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union .
in 1949 , U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman , David Lilienthal stated that " atomic energy is not simply a search for new energy , but more significantly a beginning of human history in which faith in knowledge can vitalize man 's whole life . "
this use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in technological progress as the first smelting of Bronze , of Iron , or the commencement of the Industrial Revolution .
there was also the promise of golf balls which could always be found and nuclear @-@ powered airplanes , which the US federal government even spent US $ 1.5 billion researching .
as soon as someone said - in an even mildly credible way - that these things " could " be done , then people quickly convinced themselves ... that they " would " be done .

his father , Bhagawan Chandra Bose , was a Brahmo and leader of the Brahmo Samaj and worked as a deputy magistrate / assistant commissioner in Faridpur , Bardhaman and other places .
Bose 's education started in a vernacular school , because his father believed that one must know one 's own mother tongue before beginning English , and that one should know also one 's own people .
speaking at the Bikrampur Conference in 1915 , Bose said : : " at that time , sending children to English schools was an aristocratic status symbol .
at St. Xavier 's , Bose came in contact with Jesuit Father Eugene Lafont , who played a significant role in developing his interest to natural science .
in 1954 , Pearson and Brattain gave priority to Bose for the use of a semi @-@ conducting crystal as a detector of radio waves .
Sir Nevill Mott , Nobel Laureate in 1977 for his own contributions to solid @-@ state electronics , remarked that " J.C. Bose was at least 60 years ahead of his time .

a wave produced by moving your hand in a line , up and down for instance , is a linearly polarized wave , a special case .
you can think of a ray of light , in optics , as an idealized narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation .

it is found that the thin boundary layer detaches itself ( " flow separation " ) from the body at some point and this is where the wake begins to develop .
in 1742 , Benjamin robins , a British mathematician , ballistics researcher , and military engineer , explained deviations in the trajectories of musket balls in terms of the Magnus effect .
the earliest attempt to use the Magnus effect for a heavier @-@ than @-@ air aircraft was in 1910 by a US member of Congress , Butler Ames of Massachusetts .
in physics , a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself , producing a force on another massive body .
following Newton , Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid , and since the 19th century explanations for gravity have usually been taught in terms of a field model , rather than a point attraction .
= = Classical mechanics = = In classical mechanics as in physics , the field is not real , but merely a model describing the effects of gravity .
determined in this way , the gravitational field G around a single particle of mass " M " is a vector field consisting at every point of a vector pointing directly towards the particle .
the magnitude of the field at every point is calculated applying the universal law , and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space .
the equivalent field equation in terms of mass density " ρ " of the attracting mass are : : formula _ 3which contains Gauss ' law for gravity , and Poisson 's equation for gravity .
these classical equations are differential equations of motion for a test particle in the presence of a gravitational field , i.e.

a Calabi @-@ Yau manifold , also known as a Calabi @-@ Yau space , is a special type of manifold that is described in certain branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry .
these conditions imply that the first integral Chern class c1 ( " M " ) of " M " vanishes , but the converse is not true .
* " M " has a finite cover that is a product of a torus and a simply connected manifold with trivial canonical bundle .
in particular if a compact Kähler manifold is simply connected then the weak definition above is equivalent to the stronger definition .
Enriques surfaces give examples of complex manifolds that have Ricci @-@ flat metrics , but their canonical bundles are not trivial so they are Calabi @-@ Yau manifolds according to the second but not the first definition above .
in one complex dimension , the only compact examples are tori , which form a one @-@ parameter family .
Abelian surfaces are sometimes excluded from the classification of being Calabi @-@ Yau , as their holonomy ( again the trivial group ) is a proper subgroup of SU ( 2 ) , instead of being isomorphic to SU ( 2 ) .
in the most conventional superstring models , ten conjectural dimensions in string theory are supposed to come as four of which we are aware , carrying some kind of fibration with fiber dimension six .
more precisely , in the absence of fluxes , compactification on a Calabi @-@ Yau 3 @-@ fold ( real dimension 6 ) leaves one quarter of the original supersymmetry unbroken if the holonomy is the full SU ( 3 ) .
essentially , Calabi @-@ Yau manifolds are shapes that satisfy the requirement of space for the six " unseen " spatial dimensions of string theory , which may be smaller than our currently observable lengths as they have not yet been detected .
for example , Andrew Strominger and Edward Witten have shown that the masses of particles depend on the manner of the intersection of the various holes in a Calabi @-@ Yau .
in other words , the positions of the holes relative to one another and to the substance of the Calabi @-@ Yau space was found by Strominger and Witten to affect the masses of particles in a certain way .
the Kerr metric or Kerr vacuum describes the geometry of empty spacetime around a rotating uncharged axially @-@ symmetric black hole with a spherical event horizon .
the Kerr metric is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations of general relativity ; these equations are highly non @-@ linear , which makes exact solutions very difficult to find .
the Kerr metric is a generalization of the Schwarzschild metric , which was discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 and which describes the geometry of spacetime around an uncharged , spherically @-@ symmetric , and non @-@ rotating body .
however , the exact solution for an uncharged , " rotating " black @-@ hole , the Kerr metric , remained unsolved until 1963 , when it was discovered by Roy Kerr .
rotating black holes have surfaces where the metric appears to have a singularity ; the size and shape of these surfaces depends on the black hole 's mass and angular momentum .
< / math > _ } } Thus , an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter 's rotation ; this is called frame @-@ dragging , and has been tested experimentally .
if she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms , inertial effects and frame @-@ dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change .
a useful metaphor is a planetary gear system with the black hole being the sun gear , the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear .
however , this is impossible within the ergosphere , where " gtt " is negative , unless the particle is co @-@ rotating with the interior mass " M " with an angular speed at least of Ω .
as with the event horizon in the Schwarzschild metric the apparent singularities at rinner and router are an illusion created by the choice of coordinates ( i.e. , they are coordinate singularities ) .
= = Ergosphere and the Penrose process = = A black hole in general is surrounded by a surface , called the event horizon and situated at the Schwarzschild radius for a nonrotating black hole , where the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light .
it is forced to fall inwards , and so this is sometimes called the " static limit . "
the net process is that the rotating black hole emits energetic particles at the cost of its own total energy .
the possibility of extracting spin energy from a rotating black hole was first proposed by the mathematician Roger Penrose in 1969 and is thus called the Penrose process .
rotating black holes in astrophysics are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain energetic phenomena , such as gamma ray bursts .
the Weyl tensor is algebraically special , in fact it has Petrov type D. The global structure is known .
the larger of these roots determines the location of the event horizon , and the smaller determines the location of a Cauchy horizon .
a ( future @-@ directed , time @-@ like ) curve can start in the exterior and pass through the event horizon .
the curve could then escape to infinity in the new region or enter the future event horizon of the new exterior region and repeat the process .
on the other hand , in the Kerr solution , the singularity is a ring , and the curve may pass through the center of this ring .
since the trajectory of observers and particles in general relativity are described by time @-@ like curves , it is possible for observers in this region to return to their past .
while it is expected that the exterior region of the Kerr solution is stable , and that all rotating black holes will eventually approach a Kerr metric , the interior region of the solution appears to be unstable , much like a pencil balanced on its point .
the special case formula _ 14 of the Kerr metric yields the Schwarzschild metric , which models a " nonrotating " black hole which is static and spherically symmetric , in the Schwarzschild coordinates .
= = Multipole moments = = Each asymptotically flat Ernst vacuum can be characterized by giving the infinite sequence of relativistic multipole moments , the first two of which can be interpreted as the mass and angular momentum of the source of the field .
there are alternative formulations of relativistic multipole moments due to Hansen , Thorne , and Geroch , which turn out to agree with each other .
the relativistic multipole moments of the Kerr vacuum were computed by Hansen ; they turn out to be : formula _ 15Thus , the special case of the Schwarzschild vacuum ( α = 0 ) gives the " monopole point source " of general relativity .
in a sense , the Weyl moments only ( indirectly ) characterize the " mass distribution " of an isolated source , and they turn out to depend only on the " even order " relativistic moments .
these are multi @-@ indexed quantities whose suitably symmetrized ( anti @-@ symmetrized ) parts can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the relativistic moments for the full nonlinear theory in a rather complicated manner .
this works out very nicely for the non @-@ rotating case , where we can match the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior to a Schwarzschild fluid interior , and indeed to more general static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions .
however , the problem of finding a rotating perfect @-@ fluid interior which can be matched to a Kerr exterior , or indeed to any asymptotically flat vacuum exterior solution , has proven very difficult .
in particular , the Wahlquist fluid , which was once thought to be a candidate for matching to a Kerr exterior , is now known not to admit any such matching .
like the Poincaré group , it has four connected components : the component of the identity ; the component which Reverses time and longitude ; the component which reflects through the equatorial plane ; and the component that does both .
as shown above , the Geodesic equations have four conserved quantities : one of which comes from the definition of a Geodesic , and two of which arise from the time translation and rotation symmetry of the Kerr geometry .
also in common usage an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of matter .
in most cases the boundaries of two objects may not overlap at any point in time .
the common conception of physical objects includes that they have extension in the physical world , although there do exist theories of quantum physics and cosmology which may challenge this .
a physical body as a whole is assumed to have such quantitative properties as mass , momentum , electric charge , other conserving quantities , and possibly other quantities .
in common usage an object is the material inside the boundary of an object , in 3 @-@ dimensional space .
the boundary of an object is a contiguous surface which may be used to determine what is inside , and what is outside an object .
an object is a single piece of material , whose extent is determined by a description based on the properties of the material .
a fossilized scull encased in a rock may be considered an object because it is possible to determine the extent of the scull based on the properties of the material .
under Newtonian gravity the gravitational field further away than the furthest extent of an object is determined only by the mass and the position of the center of mass .
object / particle identity is shared between common usage and quantum mechanics , although in quantum mechanics some particles may occupy the same position at the same time ( e.g.
= = In psychology = = In some branches of psychology , depending on school of thought , a physical body is a physical object with physical properties , as compared to mental objects .
in ( reductionistic ) behaviorism , a physical body and its properties are the ( only ) meaningful objects of study .
this contrasts with abstract objects such as mathematical objects which do not exist at any particular time or place .
in some philosophies , like the Idealism of George Berkeley , a physical body is a mental object , but still has extension in the space of a visual field .
in some religions , and in some new age philosophies , a physical body is contrasted with the self , mind , spirit , soul , or astral projection , and sometimes with an heavenly body .

Hoyle spent most of his working life at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge and served as its director for a number of years .
the radar work paid for a couple of trips to North America , where he took full advantage to visit astronomers .
Hoyle resigned his Plumian professor position in 1972 and his directorship of the institute in 1973 , with this move effectively cutting him off from most of his establishment power @-@ base , connections , and steady salary .
Einstein believed that there might be an asymmetry between the charges of the electron and proton so that the Earth 's magnetic field would be produced by the entire Earth .
in order to maintain the magnetic field against ohmic decay ( which would occur for the dipole field in 20,000 years ) , the outer core must be convecting .
also , the application of the theories of Carl Friedrich Gauss to magnetic observations showed that Earth 's magnetic field had an internal , rather than external , origin .
the ratio of the second term on the right hand side to the first term gives the Magnetic Reynolds number , a dimensionless ratio of advection of magnetic field to diffusion .
by applying a certain velocity field to a small magnetic field , it can be determined through observation whether the magnetic field tends to grow or not in reaction to the applied flow .
) In 1915 , she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen , a world @-@ renowned center of mathematical research .
the following year , Germany 's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions , and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania .
in 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and , despite signs of a recovery , died four days later at the age of 53 .
in her classic paper " Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen " ( " Theory of ideals in Ring domains , " 1921 ) Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a powerful tool with wide @-@ ranging applications .
after teaching there for seven years , he took a position in the Bavarian city of Erlangen , where he met and married IDA Amalia Kaufmann , the daughter of a prosperous merchant .
her first name was " Amalie , " after her mother and paternal grandmother , but she began using her middle name at a young age .
she was taught to cook and clean , as were most girls of the time , and she took piano lessons .
her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls , but she chose instead to continue her studies at the University of Erlangen .
during the 1903 @-@ 04 winter semester , she studied at the University of Göttingen , attending lectures given by astronomer Karl Schwarzschild and mathematicians Hermann Minkowski , Otto Blumenthal , Felix Klein , and David Hilbert .
= = = University of Göttingen = = = In the spring of 1915 , Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein .
during her first years teaching at Göttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid ; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work .
in collaboration with W. Schmeidler , she then published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring .
( Feynman ) * typically theoretically reversible in time ( if non @-@ quantum ) , although time itself is irreversible .
= = examples = = Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in Isaac Newton 's theories of ( now ) classical mechanics , presented in his " Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica , " and in Albert Einstein 's theory of relativity .
in such cases it is common to use the simpler , approximate versions of the laws , instead of the more accurate general laws .
one strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions .
by Lenz 's law , an Eddy current creates a magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field that created it , and thus Eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field .
if either the conductor is moving through a steady magnetic field , or the magnetic field is changing around a stationary conductor , Eddy currents will occur in the conductor .
Eddy currents will be generated wherever a conducting object experiences a change in the intensity or direction of the magnetic field at any point within it , and not just at the boundaries .
it was then that hydrogen and helium formed to become the content of the first stars , and is responsible for the present hydrogen / helium ratio of the cosmos .
some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons ( the R process ) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion .
in addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe , a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth .
this first process , Big Bang nucleosynthesis , was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the universe .
Interstellar gas therefore contains declining abundances of these light elements , which are present only by virtue of their nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang .
all the rest constitute less than 2 % of the mass of the Solar System , and of other star systems as well .
in the years immediately before World War II , Hans Bethe first elucidated those nuclear mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium .
that paper defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into others within stars , processes that could be documented by astronomers .
this would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point , a " primeval atom , " to a state before which time and space did not exist .
the products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the interstellar gas through mass loss episodes and the stellar winds of low mass stars .
the detection of technetium in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952 , by spectroscopy , provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars .
the R @-@ process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements , such as uranium and thorium , as well as the most neutron @-@ rich isotopes of each heavy element .
the RP @-@ process ( rapid proton ) involves the rapid absorption of free protons as well as neutrons , but its role and its existence are less certain .
the light elements 1H and 4He Nuclei are not a product of spallation and are represented in the cosmos with approximately primordial abundance .
however , some nuclides are also produced by a number of natural means that have continued after primordial elements were in place .
in other types of radioactive decay , such as cluster decay , larger species of Nuclei are ejected ( for example , neon @-@ 20 ) , and these eventually become newly formed stable Atoms .

Bombay was chosen as the location for the prosed Institute as the Government of Bombay showed interest in becoming a joint founder of the proposed institute .
the approach proposed by Bhabha to achieve this strategic objective became India 's three stage nuclear power programme .
the Homi Bhabha fellowship Council has been giving the Homi Bhabha Fellowships since 1967 Other noted institutions in his name are the Homi Bhabha National Institute , an Indian deemed university and the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education , Mumbai , India .

he was the oldest of four children , having two younger brothers , Joseph and Robert , and a younger sister , Mary .
after graduating from the Baltimore City College high school in 1926 , Wheeler entered Johns Hopkins University with a scholarship from the state of Maryland .
he received a National Research Council fellowship , which he used to study under Gregory Breit at New York University in 1933 and 1934 , and then in Copenhagen under Niels Bohr in 1934 and 1935 .
he co @-@ wrote a paper with Robert F. Christy on " chain Reaction of pure Fissionable materials in Solution , " which was important in the plutonium purification process .
after the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project , it gave responsibility for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to Dupont .
those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski , Marshall Rosenbluth , Lothar Nordheim and Charles Critchfield , but there was also now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory , led by Norris Bradbury .
at Los Alamos , Wheeler and his family moved into the house on " Bathtub Row " that had been occupied by Robert Oppenheimer and his family during the war .
in January 1953 he was involved in a security breach when he lost a highly classified paper on Lithium @-@ 6 and the hydrogen bomb design during an overnight train trip .
Wheeler was a key figure in the revival of the subject , leading the school at Princeton , while Dennis William Sciama and Yakov Borisovich Zel 'dovich developed the subject at Cambridge University and the University of Moscow .
the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo @-@ negative @-@ pressure density produced by the Casimir effect .
the soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by John Scott Russell ( 1808 @-@ 1882 ) who observed a solitary wave in the Union Canal in Scotland .
if the pulse has just the right shape , the Kerr effect will exactly cancel the dispersion effect , and the pulse 's shape will not change over time : a soliton .
the discovery is described here in Scott Russell 's own words : Scott Russell spent some time making practical and theoretical investigations of these waves .
in 1965 Norman Zabusky of Bell Labs and Martin Kruskal of Princeton University first demonstrated soliton behavior in media subject to the Korteweg @-@ de Vries equation ( KdV equation ) in a computational investigation using a finite difference approach .
the work of Peter lax on lax pairs and the lax equation has since extended this to solution of many related soliton @-@ generating systems .
in some physical contexts ( for instance string theory ) this feature can be important , which motivated the introduction of a special name for this class of solitons .
it is analogous to the electric potential with mass playing the role of charge .
the reference location , where the potential is zero , is by convention infinitely far away from any mass , resulting in a negative potential at any finite distance .
in mathematics the gravitational potential is also known as the Newtonian potential and is fundamental in the study of potential theory .
in some situations , the equations can be simplified by assuming a field that is nearly independent of position .
for instance , in daily life , in the region close to the surface of the Earth , the gravitational acceleration can be considered constant .
= = Multipole expansion = = The potential at a point x is given by : formula _ 12The potential can be expanded in a series of Legendre polynomials .
the list is ordered by solar mass ( ) and Jupiter mass ( ) .
because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition , their properties ( such as distance , age , metallicity and extinction ) are more easily determined than they are for isolated stars .
because of their location , open clusters are occasionally referred to as " Galactic clusters , " a term that was introduced in 1925 by the Swiss @-@ American astronomer Robert Julius Trumpler .
Micrometer measurements of the positions of stars in clusters were made as early as 1877 by the German astronomer E. Schönfeld and further pursued by the American astronomer E. E. Barnard prior to his death in 1923 .
however , in 1918 the Dutch @-@ American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen was able to measure the proper motion of stars in part of the Pleiades cluster by comparing photographic plates taken at different times .
these clouds have densities that vary from 102 to 106 molecules of neutral hydrogen per cm3 , with star formation occurring in regions with densities above 104 molecules per cm3 .
stellar winds and radiation pressure from the massive stars begins to drive away the hot ionized gas at a velocity matching the speed of sound in the gas .
after a few million years the cluster will experience its first core @-@ collapse supernovae , which will also expel gas from the vicinity .
the largest clusters can have 104 solar masses , with the massive cluster Westerlund 1 being estimated at 5 × 104 solar masses ; close to that of a globular cluster .
once they have exhausted their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion , medium- to low @-@ mass stars shed their outer layers to form a planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs .
in many cases , the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal .
eventually , the cluster becomes a stream of stars , not close enough to be a cluster but all related and moving in similar directions at similar speeds .
estimated cluster half lives , after which half the original cluster members will have been lost , range from 150 @-@ 800 million years , depending on the original density .
the study of the abundances of Lithium and beryllium in open cluster stars can give important clues about the evolution of stars and their interior structures .
while hydrogen Nuclei cannot Fuse to form helium until the temperature reaches about 10 million K , Lithium and beryllium are destroyed at temperatures of 2.5 million K and 3.5 million K respectively .
this relies on the fact that the stars of a cluster share a common motion through space .
these luminous stars can be detected at great distances , and are then used to extend the distance scale to nearby galaxies in the Local Group .

for his 1995 release ... " I Care Because You Do " James used an image of his face for the album cover , a motif which would be repeated on many of his later records .
the crowdfunding was approved by Rephlex Records and James , with each contributor receiving the right to keep their digital copy of the album .
in analysis of structures , free body diagrams for a component of a structure or , part thereof , are used in determining shear forces and bending moments .
= = example : a block on an inclined plane = = A simple free body diagram , shown above , of a block on a ramp illustrates this .
an object 's possible future locations are limited by the speed that the object can move , which is at best the speed of light .
in these situations the object would " have " to move , since its present spatial location would not be in its own future light cone .
it is impossible to determine based only on knowledge of the past whether or not something exists in the CTC that can interfere with other objects in spacetime .
no CTC can be continuously deformed as a CTC to a point ( that is , a CTC and a point are not timelike homotopic ) , as the manifold would not be causally well behaved at that point .
we have CTCs contractible to a point ( if we no longer insist it has to be future @-@ directed timelike everywhere ) , and we have CTCs which are not contractible .
X @-@ ray astronomy is the space science related to a type of space telescope that can see farther than standard light @-@ absorption telescopes , such as the Mauna Kea Observatories , via x @-@ ray radiation .
it is now known that such X @-@ ray sources as Sco X @-@ 1 are compact stars , such as neutron stars or black holes .
in addition , the space between galaxies in Galaxy clusters is filled with a very hot , but very dilute gas at a temperature between 10 and 100 megakelvins ( MK ) .
an Aerobee 150 rocket was launched on June 12 , 1962 and it detected the first X @-@ rays from other celestial sources ( Scorpius X @-@ 1 ) .
the energy that occupies the same volume , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , is the interstellar radiation field .
unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes , balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer .
when a burst trigger is recorded , the instrument switches to record high resolution data , recording it to a 32 @-@ kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out .
there were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors ( taken either in 1 , 2 , 4 , 16 , or 32 second integrations ) .
perform a timing analysis in order to study the temporal behavior of each candidate on different time scales .
" the Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X @-@ rays , " says Prof. Kris Davidson of the University of Minnesota .
= = X @-@ ray dark stars = = During the solar cycle , as shown in the sequence of images at right , at times the Sun is almost X @-@ ray dark , almost an X @-@ ray variable .
the benefit of studying single stars is that it allows measurements free of any effects of a companion or being a part of a multiple star system .
the torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma , in the process stretching it into a pancake @-@ like structure called a magnetodisk .
the position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind , which in turn depends on solar activity .
it consists of two lobes ( blue areas in the figure ) , with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter , and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it .
the plasma temperature within the torus is 10 @-@ 100 eV ( 100,000 @-@ 1,000,000 K ) , which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts - 10 keV ( 100 million K ) .
as cold , dense plasma moves outward , it is replaced by hot , low @-@ density plasma ( temperature 20 keV ( 200 million K ) or higher ) moving from the outer magnetosphere .
the acceleration of the plasma into the co @-@ rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the kinetic energy of the plasma .
in particular , magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector .
all these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process , known on Earth as the Dungey cycle , may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere .
as mentioned above , the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere .
this heating , which produces up to 300 TW of power , is responsible for the strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter .
the secondary ovals observed inside the main Oval may be related to the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps .
Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3 MHz ( and thus wavelengths longer than 1 km ) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or Kom .
the total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100 GW , while the power of all other HOM / Kom components is about 10 GW .
this periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere , which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment with respect to the rotational axis as well as by high @-@ latitude magnetic anomalies .
the energy of the electrons that contribute to the dim emissions is from 0.1 to 100 MeV , while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1 @-@ 20 MeV .
the planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub @-@ micrometer ring particles as well , which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation .
the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede , which has an intrinsic magnetic moment , differs from its interaction with the non @-@ magnetized moons .
the first space probe to reach Jupiter was pioneer 10 in December 1973 , which passed within 2.9 " R " J from the center of the planet .
in some applications , a Helmholtz coil is used to cancel out the Earth 's magnetic field , producing a region with a magnetic field intensity much closer to zero .
the inflection point for a simple coil is located along the coil axis at a distance formula _ 12 from its centre .
the calculation detailed below gives the exact value of the magnetic field at the center point .
the Einstein @-@ Hilbert action ( also referred to as Hilbert action ) in general relativity is the action that yields the Einstein field equations through the principle of least action .
the Palatini formulation of general relativity assumes the metric and connection to be independent , and varies with respect to both independently , which makes it possible to include fermionic matter fields with non @-@ integral spin .
the right hand side of this equation is ( by definition ) proportional to the stress @-@ energy tensor , : formula _ 13To calculate the left hand side of the equation we need the variations of the Ricci scalar R and the determinant of the metric .
= = = variation of the Riemann tensor , the Ricci tensor , and the Ricci scalar = = = To calculate the variation of the Ricci scalar we calculate first the variation of the Riemann curvature tensor , and then the variation of the Ricci tensor .
Magnetohydrodynamics ( MHD ) ( " magneto fluid dynamics " or " hydromagnetics " ) is the study of the dynamics of electrically conducting fluids .
the set of equations that describe MHD are a combination of the Navier @-@ Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and Maxwell 's equations of electromagnetism .
this difficulty in reconnecting magnetic field lines makes it possible to store energy by moving the fluid or the source of the magnetic field .
magnetic reconnection in highly conductive systems is important because it concentrates energy in time and space , so that gentle forces applied to a plasma for long periods of time can cause violent explosions and bursts of radiation .
the liquid outer core moves in the presence of the magnetic field and eddies are set up into the same due to the Coriolis effect .
the differential solar rotation may be the long @-@ term effect of magnetic drag at the poles of the Sun , an MHD phenomenon due to the Parker spiral shape assumed by the extended magnetic field of the Sun .
breakdown of ideal MHD ( in the form of magnetic reconnection ) is known to be the cause of solar flares , the largest explosions in the solar system .
these results led to a number of papers of Bianchi models with a perfect @-@ fluid magnetic field source .
Viscous MHD Bianchi models , which are of special interest with regards to early @-@ universe cosmologies have been presented in the literature on a number of occasions .
the first prototype of this kind of propulsion was built and tested in 1965 by Steward Way , a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
way , on leave from his job at Westinghouse Electric , assigned his senior @-@ year undergraduate students to develop a submarine with this new propulsion system .

the phrase " light field " was coined by Arun Gershun in a classic paper on the radiometric properties of light in three @-@ dimensional space ( 1936 ) .
the plenoptic illumination function is an idealized function used in computer vision and computer graphics to express the image of a scene from any possible viewing position at any viewing angle at any point in time .
however , this distinction is not real , because light is also made of waves and a similar reduction in dimension could in principle be applied .
the Atwood machine ( or Atwood 's machine ) was invented in 1784 by the English mathematician George Atwood as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws of motion with constant acceleration .
= = equation for constant acceleration = = We are able to derive an equation for the acceleration by using force analysis .
= = equation for tension = = It can be useful to know an equation for the tension in the string .
for example , this could result in extremely long telescopes such as the very long aerial telescopes of the 17th century .
since Abbe numbers are positive , one of the focal lengths must be negative , i.e. , a diverging lens , for the condition to be met .
the above are closely related to the specific scene that is captured so no amount of programming and knowledge of the capturing equipment ( e.g. , camera and lens data ) can overcome these limitations .
if the optical filter passed only that frequency band , then there would be a net transfer of photons , and their energy , from the second system to the first .
in this sense the material of the opaque body is black to radiation that reaches it , while the whole phenomenon , including the interior and the interface , does not show perfect blackness .
in the case of the Sun , it has been on the main sequence for roughly 4.6 billion years , and will become a red giant in roughly 6.5 billion years for a total main sequence lifetime of roughly 11 billion ( 1010 ) years .
historically , errors in the nuclear reaction rates have been one of the biggest sources of error in stellar modelling .
since there are many nuclear species , a computerised reaction network is needed to keep track of how all the abundances vary together .
in the core , the luminosity due to nuclear reactions is transmitted to outer layers principally by radiation .
Radiative transport of energy is described by the radiative temperature gradient equation : : formula _ 3where κ is the opacity of the matter , σ is the Stefan @-@ Boltzmann constant , and the Boltzmann constant is set to one .
the simulations only cover a very small fraction of the solar radius , and are evidently far too time @-@ consuming to be included in general solar modeling .
an extension of mixing @-@ length theory , including effects of turbulent pressure and kinetic energy , based on numerical simulations of near @-@ surface convection , has been developed .
the vast majority of neutrinos are produced through the pp chain , a process in which four protons are combined to produce two protons , two neutrons , two positrons , and two electron neutrinos .
this was a reaction channel expected for neutrinos , but since only the number of Argon decays was counted , it did not give any directional information , such as where the neutrinos came from .
the experiment found about 1 / 3 as many neutrinos as were predicted by the standard solar model of the time , and this problem became known as the solar neutrino problem .
the radiochemical experiments were only sensitive to electron neutrinos , and the signal in the water Cerenkov experiments was dominated by the electron neutrino signal .
= = = HEP neutrinos = = = The highest energy neutrinos have not yet been observed due to their small flux compared to the boron @-@ 8 neutrinos , so thus far only limits have been placed on the flux .
this should be possible thanks to SNO + and , on the longer term , thanks to Lena , two detectors that will be larger but will use the same principles of Borexino .
for this reason , a precise measurement of the boron @-@ 8 neutrino flux can be used in the framework of the standard solar model as a measurement of the temperature of the core of the Sun .
the technique was first proposed as a mid @-@ course manoeuvre in 1961 by Michael Minovitch working on the three @-@ body problem .
clouds in the Earth 's lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles , but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles .
although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds , it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole .
as the mesosphere contains very little moisture , approximately one hundred millionth that of air from the Sahara desert , and is extremely thin , the ice crystals can form only at temperatures below about .
systematic photographic observations of the clouds were organized in 1887 by Jesse , Foerster , and Stolze and , after that year , continuous observations were carried out at the Berlin Observatory .
on August 28 , 2006 , scientists with the Mars Express mission announced that they found clouds of carbon dioxide crystals over Mars that extended up to above the surface of the planet .
the cloud was to be observed over a period of weeks or months by ground instruments and the Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals ( SHIMMER ) instrument on the NRL / STP STPSat @-@ 1 spacecraft .
they are very faint and tenuous , and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow , but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun .
a predestination paradox ( also called causal loop , causality loop , and , less frequently , closed loop or closed time loop ) is a paradox of time travel that is often used as a convention in science fiction .
in other words , a temporal causality loop is a theoretical phenomenon which occurs when a chain of cause @-@ effect events is circular .
for instance , if event A causes event B , and event B causes event C , and event C causes event A , then these events are said to be in a causality loop .
in a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy , the person is fulfilling their role in an event that has " yet " to occur , and it is usually information that travels in time ( for example , in the form of a prophecy ) rather than a person .

the stress @-@ energy tensor is the source of the gravitational field in the Einstein field equations of general relativity , just as mass density is the source of such a field in Newtonian gravity .
= = = Covariant and mixed forms = = = In most of this article we work with the contravariant form , " T " μν of the stress @-@ energy tensor .
what this means is that the continuity equation no longer implies that the non @-@ gravitational energy and momentum expressed by the tensor are absolutely conserved , i.e.
in the classical limit of Newtonian gravity , this has a simple interpretation : energy is being exchanged with gravitational potential energy , which is not included in the tensor , and momentum is being transferred through the field to other bodies .
on the other hand , viscosity itself was not enough to explain the transport of angular momentum to the exterior parts of the disc .
by using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , combined with conservation of angular momentum and assuming that the disc is thin , the equations of disk structure may be solved in terms of the formula _ 4 parameter .
using Kramers ' law for the opacity it is found that : formula _ 19 : formula _ 20 : formula _ 21where formula _ 22 and formula _ 23 are the mid @-@ plane temperature and density respectively .
in the radiatively inefficient case , the disk may " puff up " into a torus or some other three @-@ dimensional solution like an Advection dominated Accretion flow ( ADAF ) .
a simple system displaying this mechanism is a gas disc in the presence of a weak axial magnetic field .
the inner fluid element is then forced by the spring to slow down , reduce correspondingly its angular momentum causing it to move to a lower orbit .
these fields are typically weak ( about few micro @-@ Gauss ) , but they can get anchored to the matter in the disc , because of its high electrical Conductivity , and carried inward toward the central star .
this process can concentrate the magnetic flux around the centre of the disc giving rise to very strong magnetic fields .
formation of powerful astrophysical jets along the rotation axis of accretion disks requires a large scale poloidal magnetic field in the inner regions of the disc .
= = Analytic models of sub @-@ Eddington accretion discs ( thin discs , ADAFs ) = = When the accretion rate is sub @-@ Eddington and the opacity very high , the standard thin accretion disc is formed .
they are very radiatively inefficient , geometrically extended , similar in shape to a sphere ( or a " corona " ) rather than a disc , and very hot ( close to the virial temperature ) .
ADAFs emit a power @-@ law , non @-@ thermal radiation , often with a strong Compton component .
in 1959 and 1960 , Löwdin started the quantum Theory Project at the University of Florida as a sister project to the Uppsala quantum Chemistry Group .
the International Winter Institutes ( held initially at Sanibel Island , and later at Gainesville ) provided the initiation of hundreds of Latin American young scientists during the eighties and nineties .
Löwdin was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1969 and was a member of the committee for the Nobel Prize in Physics from 1972 to 1984 .

narrative of the work develops around analysis of the relations between civil society and political society , including Marx 's most famous commentaries on the function of religion in the introduction .
in statistical mechanics , a semi @-@ classical derivation of the entropy that does not take into account the indistinguishability of particles , yields an expression for the entropy which is not extensive ( is not proportional to the amount of substance in question ) .
there is a freedom in what is defined as ordered , and it would be a mistake to conclude the entropy had not increased .
in particular , Gibbs ' non @-@ extensive entropy quantity for an ideal gas was not intended for varying numbers of particles .
in a generic system without symmetries , a full quantum treatment would yield a discrete non @-@ degenerate set of energy eigenstates .
when we specify the internal energy to be U , what we really mean is that the total energy of the gas lies somewhere in an interval of length formula _ 8 around U.
in other words , if there are two gases A and B and we have not yet discovered that they are different , then assuming they are the same will cause no theoretical problems .
it differs from the full calculation in three ways : # The ideal gas consists of particles confined to one spatial dimension .
the neglected terms play a role when the number of particles is not very large , such as in computer simulation and nanotechnology .
we begin with a version of Boltzmann 's entropy in which the integrand is all of accessible phase space : : formula _ 18The integral is restricted to a contour of available regions of phase space , subject to conservation of energy .
this may explain the difficulties in constructing a clear and simple derivation for the dependence of entropy on the number of particles .

a mechanical equilibrium is a state in which a momentum coordinate of a particle , rigid body , or dynamical system is conserved .
for instance , a linear mechanical equilibrium would be a state in which the linear momentum of the system is conserved as the net force on the object is zero .
more generally in conservative systems , equilibrium is established at a point in configuration space where the gradient with respect to the generalized coordinates of the potential energy is zero .
in the terminology of elementary calculus , a system at mechanical equilibrium is at a critical point in potential energy where the first derivative is zero .
in the planar case , the minimal number is 4 , while in three dimensions one can build an object with just one stable and one unstable balance point , this is called gomboc .
the relative strength index ( RSI ) is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets .
