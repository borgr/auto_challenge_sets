in the area of its anti @@@ -@@ @ tru@@ st@@ operations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibi@@ tan agreement or@@ to issue an in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion@@ that a restric@@ tive practice be stopped , but also to im@@ pos@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ on firms found guilty of anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive conduct .

on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Fren@@ ch@@ committee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 199@@ 8.@@ The committee , the C@@ F@@ O , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event th@@ at@@ included ticket sales .

it must be bor@@ ne in@@ mind that the Commission 's objective in the mer@@ ger control field is to preserve as@@ itu@@ ation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be agu@@ aran@@ tee of growth and thus of viable jobs .

since the@@ entry into force of the mer@@ ger regulation , the Commission has seen th@@ en@@ um@@ ber of noti@@ fic@@ ations grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
In@@ some cases , the mer@@ ger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen ad@@ omin@@ ant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a sol@@ u@@ tion@@ to the competition concerns raised by the Commission .

they should also commit themselves exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assur@@ ance , in their work . "
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
the " Standard for initial Te@@ acher Education : bench@@ mark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have at@@ tained at the end of their programmes .
Germany : only evalu@@ ations of bac@@ hel@@ or '@@ s@@ - and master 's @@@ -@@ @ type programmes are used for the purpose of accredi@@ tation ( or re @@@ -@@ @ accredi@@ tation ) .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occur@@ s at regular inter@@ vals and another whose frequ@@ ency var@@ ies .
in teacher training col@@ leg@@ es , internal evaluation is carried out by the colle@@ ge council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
Cyprus : the F@@ ig@@ ure rela@@ tes solely to the internal evaluation of col@@ leg@@ es providing initial teacher education for primary educ@@ ation@@ .@@ Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the fac@@ ul@@ ties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should cons@@ ist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
the student self @@@ -@@ @ governing body may deleg@@ ate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
chapter 3 -@@ Internal E@@ valu@@ ation of initial Te@@ acher Education
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification fra@@ me@@ works for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the out@@ comes of the General Te@@ aching Council for Scot@@ land process will in turn fe@@ ed back into the internal quality assur@@ ance processes of the university .
however , there is no exp@@ li@@ cit mention of this having to happen - simply an expec@@ tation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curricul@@ um is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the course work@@ load and the teachers ' and ass@@ ist@@ ants " ability to deliver the course .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school pla@@ cements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the sel@@ f@@ evaluation report .
Greece : the information rela@@ tes to the law on quality assur@@ ance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
the level of funding may also v@@ ary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation decisions , conditional or temporary accredi@@ tation may be awarded in the case of non @@@ -@@ @ compliance with accredi@@ tation requirements .
for schools in partnership with the institution concerned
Czech Republic : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occur@@ s prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursu@@ es several aims .
it imp@@ lies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .
Germany : only the results of external evalu@@ ations to ( re@@ - ) acc@@ re@@ dit bac@@ hel@@ or 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nation@@ ally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illu@@ strated in the examples below .
teacher unions or teacher associations
these two projects are currently being implemented .
in these two countries , regulations on both accredi@@ tation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
those referred to as " comp@@ ul@@ sory " in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.2 are common to all Aut@@ onomous Commun@@ ities , whereas those termed " op@@ tional " reflect the situation of just some of them .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
in line with the decentral@@ ised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accredi@@ tation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Aut@@ onomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of in@@ service teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
as regards evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many L@@ ä@@ n@@ der have established or appointed central institu@@ tes or agencies for this task .
Finland : In@@ service teacher education of at least 30 EC@@ T@@ S provided by higher education institutions may be accredi@@ ted by the FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC at the request of the provider .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practi@@ sing teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during after@@ no@@ ons , week@@ ends or summer .
an inspec@@ torate for in@@ service teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining ) , where it particip@@ ates in evaluation along with other bodies .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.@@ 4 are not usually covered .

In@@ service teacher education abroad
the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accredi@@ tation of in@@ service teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
furthermore , the Sul@@ i@@ Nova K@@ ht ( a non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisation ) monitors in@@ service teacher education programmes by means of a sel@@ f@@ evaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervis@@ es and approves the National Centre of In@@ service Tra@@ ining activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educ@@ ational Auth@@ orities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of in@@ service teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the R@@ EA
the Ministry has the right to control the accredi@@ ted programmes during the period of accredi@@ tation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @@@ -@@ @ making with respect to the goals , processes and instruc@@ tors of the programmes .
in the Netherlands , accredi@@ tation results are published on the website of the N@@ eder@@ lands @@@ -@@ @ Vla@@ am@@ se Ac@@ credi@@ tati@@ e Organ@@ is@@ ati@@ e ( N@@ V@@ AO , or Ac@@ credi@@ tation Organisation of The Netherlands and F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adap@@ t procedures for evalu@@ ating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and comp@@ ul@@ sory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the defin@@ ition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of in@@ service teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curricul@@ um of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be at@@ tained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredi@@ ted or certi@@ fied .

it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " in C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's five key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators ;
however it is important to bear in mind that kno@@ wing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are mer@@ ely long @@@ -@@ @ term goals .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "

once the stak@@ ehol@@ ders have been identified , it is necessary for the N@@ D@@ O to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .

• clar@@ ify the process for delivery and identify the end benef@@ i ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national co@@ ordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs co@@ ordinating body , et@@ c . )
in countries where the N@@ D@@ O is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug co@@ ordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 7 ) :
when the N@@ D@@ O is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confi@@ dential note to the national drug co@@ ordinating body ( N@@ DC ) - if relevant - or trans@@ mits the information through the normal channels .

however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the cho@@ ices to be made .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the N@@ D@@ O will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ D@@ O 's capacity to deliver out@@ puts and be accountable for the use of funds .
if the N@@ D@@ O is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
there are no institutional models to be cop@@ ied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

sum@@ m@@ ary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bun@@ des@@ l@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
country samp@@ le siz@@ es were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
the total amount of alcohol consu@@ med during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequ@@ encies .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man and the United Kingdom .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
in the two top @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Is@@ le of Man ) one in six students reported can@@ na@@ bis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular can@@ na@@ bis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days can@@ na@@ bis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try can@@ na@@ bis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illi@@ cit drugs at least once during their lif@@ etime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from can@@ na@@ bis were found , and the percentage of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users in a population correspon@@ ds to the can@@ na@@ bis use pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report non@@ pres@@ cri@@ bed use of these drugs ( 8 % ver@@ sus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the overall sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the vari@@ able in focus .
the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the vari@@ ables .
sum@@ m@@ ary western Europe and countries dis@@ playing increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illi@@ cit drug use is rising .
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult cho@@ ices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
nearly 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
overall range 0.@@ 8 % to 1@@ 1.3 %
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .

annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise defin@@ ition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
possession of more than 10 dos@@ es must be charged under Sec@@ tion 17@@ 2 , which , depending on the ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offen@@ ders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guide@@ line on can@@ na@@ bis , " according to which possession of up to 10 gram@@ s of can@@ na@@ bis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
other sent@@ encing statistics showed that the w@@ ai@@ ving of reports as stat@@ ut@@ ory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convic@@ tions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed comp@@ ul@@ sory treatment , effectively decreas@@ ing the involvement of the prob@@ ation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sent@@ encing , or avo@@ idance of sent@@ encing , give a far more accur@@ ate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 2@@ a ) .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
countries where this is the case , can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related offences in 2004 accounted for 34 @@@ -@@ @ 87 % of all drug law offences .
chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first in@@ sight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to under@@ pin , support and explain to the population at large the ration@@ ale under@@ lying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical gu@@ idance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .

in the new central European M@@ ember States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies wi@@ den the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
a similar specialised programme for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 action plan calls on M@@ ember States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social re@@ integration programmes . "
non@@ e@@ theless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
the main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
the service most com@@ mon@@ ly offered to home@@ less problem drug users is access to " gener@@ ic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries comb@@ ine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from M@@ ember States conver@@ ge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and prec@@ ar@@ ious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social re@@ integration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illi@@ cit drugs , with the standard time fra@@ mes , and frequ@@ ency of use .
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
the lowest lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
other countries are also working on scal@@ es to assess intensive forms of can@@ na@@ bis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is promoting collaboration in this area .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78

reports about ac@@ ute or chron@@ ic health problems requiring medical interven@@ tions relating to the use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces by young people .
this is a common feature of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to conf@@ ine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for rec@@ re@@ ational purposes ( 130 ) .
in March 2001 the UN drug control system added G@@ H@@ B to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU M@@ ember States have been up@@ dating their legislation on this sub@@ stance .
the shortage of pre@@ val@@ ence data on G@@ H@@ B and ket@@ am@@ ine suggests that use of these substan@@ ces has stabil@@ ised at low levels in most countries .
however , the absence of accur@@ ate and compar@@ able systems for recor@@ ding deaths and non @@@ -@@ @ fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies related to the use of these substan@@ ces limits the data available in this area .

deaths due to bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine po@@ is@@ oning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the ag@@ on@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ ant@@ ag@@ on@@ ist pharmac@@ ological character@@ isti@@ cs of this drug .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreas@@ es in the numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment avail@@ ability and harm reduction initiatives , although dec@@ lines in the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use may also be important .
210 which should be considered as a minimum estimate (
although interpre@@ tations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths in some countries , these pat@@ ter@@ ns could be related to the trends in heroin in@@ j@@ ection ( 20@@ 9 ) .
research into the circumstances of over@@ dos@@ es has supported the development of interven@@ tions that target high @@@ -@@ @ risk situations or high @@@ -@@ @ risk individuals .
such measures may achieve an important reduction in the deaths attri@@ but@@ able to the immediate effects of drug taking .
the data that do exist indicate that many deaths involving cocaine also involve op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe meth@@ ad@@ one sub@@ stitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce over@@ d@@ ose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
non@@ e@@ theless , it is linked to the various concep@@ ts of addi@@ ction by the understanding that someone be@@ having in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem us@@ er . "
in terms of the current implementation of the P@@ D@@ U indicator across the EU , countries have adap@@ ted the defin@@ ition to cover the prac@@ tic@@ alities of their local situation and the position is therefore het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorpor@@ ated into the monitoring exercise , beyond P@@ D@@ U monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods comple@@ ment population survey work , which , for a range of meth@@ od@@ ological and practical reasons , is less su@@ itable for esti@@ m@@ ating the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use that is of low pre@@ val@@ ence , sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ sed and largely hidden .
a second drug with a functional or pharmac@@ ological ration@@ ale is not con@@ fined to simultane@@ ous use but may also be used consecu@@ tively , as a replacement or as a comple@@ mentary drug .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
moreover , it should be bor@@ ne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most com@@ mon@@ ly consu@@ med illi@@ cit drug by young and very young people .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
although some M@@ ember States have introduced sch@@ e@@ mes to di@@ ver@@ t offen@@ ders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
Europe remains the main global market for can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , most of which is produced in North Africa . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis is also available in Europe ,
Co@@ ordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new inter@@ governmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine inter@@ diction .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher pro@@ portion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tri@@ pled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased pre@@ val@@ ence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
across Europe , H@@ C@@ V rates are high among in@@ j@@ ecting populations , and studies show that young in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @@@ -@@ @ using care@@ ers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
reductions in cultiv@@ ation can be achieved quickly but are rever@@ sed equally quickly .
over@@ d@@ ose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoi@@ dable mortality among young adults .
this approach , which has been in place in other M@@ ember States ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benef@@ ited from the experience of earlier ones .
a noti@@ ce@@ able trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two comple@@ mentary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the new regulation clar@@ i@@ fies the countries to which the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA can transfer its know @@@ -@@ @ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interven@@ tions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interven@@ tions and the importance given
there is also some activity in the area of developing inde@@ x@@ es designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
the concep@@ tu@@ alisation of both instruments has involved interesting meth@@ od@@ ological developments and has allowed a first in@@ sight into the use of overall inde@@ x@@ es to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .

however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly can@@ na@@ bis users , the lik@@ elihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinc@@ tion has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .

chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with in@@ put from the EU M@@ ember States , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in C@@ hap@@ ter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .

these expenditures are not necessarily la@@ bel@@ led as dru@@ g@@ related in official accoun@@ tancy documents .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all wi@@ den the scope for direc@@ ting drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established

though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

based on reports from 25 M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an over@@ view of the organisation of dru@@ g@@ related research in European countries .
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA through its network of Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .

helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social re@@ integration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
however , there is no such enti@@ t@@ lement if the offen@@ der is expected to be released within three months or is considered un@@ fit or not motivated for treatment .

as with lif@@ etime experience , there is a wide vari@@ ation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually un@@ reported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among mal@@ es .

in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .
countries with sufficient data on last year pre@@ val@@ ence of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use among the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .

similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.@@ 7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
a multi @@@ -@@ @ city European study with targeted samples of cocaine users in nine cities ( Pr@@ in@@ z@@ le@@ ve et al . , 2004 ) found
overall the estimated lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the U@@ SA .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .
frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tions than non@@ users ( Qu@@ res@@ hi et al . , 2001 ) .
of the M@@ ember States that report high pre@@ val@@ ence levels of cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evalu@@ ated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e clin@@ ical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als ( ar@@ ip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and ro@@ pin@@ ir@@ ole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .
according to a recent Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom report ( nice , 2007 ) , cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
once administered , the vacc@@ ine indu@@ ces the production of anti@@ bodies that bin@@ d to cocaine mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les in the blo@@ od@@ stream and , there@@ by , allow n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing en@@ z@@ y@@ mes to conver@@ t them in to in@@ active mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
for example , in some countries where problem op@@ i@@ oid use has histor@@ ically pre@@ dominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use at national level during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 range roughly between one and six cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use of between four and five cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 of the population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 can be der@@ ived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it imp@@ lies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
treatment found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
most drug clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 23 % ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 18 % ) .
of the 3@@ 87 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one : mainly bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , pain@@ kil@@ lers and other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 112 ) .

the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
among op@@ i@@ oid users entering out@@ patient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower pro@@ portion report in@@ j@@ ecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .

the var@@ ying levels of new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initi@@ ation as well as increasing in@@ j@@ ecting inci@@ dence among the younger or the older populations .
a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users and the reported number of treat@@ ments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving sub@@ stitution treatment .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .

in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnos@@ ed inf@@ ections related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use with trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among I@@ D@@ U@@ s suggests that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .

prisons are important sett@@ ings for interven@@ tions targeting inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
moreover , many dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths are , in fact , pol@@ y@@ drug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circum@@ stan@@ tial reasons ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . violence related to the drug trade ) .
however , other approaches are being explo@@ red where@@ by data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attri@@ but@@ able to drugs in a community ( see " Over@@ all dru@@ g@@ related mortality , " P . 86 ) .

furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitu@@ tes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's future activities .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confron@@ ted .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
a les@@ son that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practi@@ tion@@ ers can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
in addition , developments in ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addi@@ ction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
the estimates presented here rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
problem op@@ i@@ oid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
a c@@ av@@ eat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a dimin@@ ishing problem trend in heroin @@@ -@@ @ related problems is no longer sustained .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the ep@@ i@@ demic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems ar@@ ising from the use of this drug are considerable .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that sub@@ stance use problems are best addressed hol@@ isti@@ cally and in the context of healthy lif@@ est@@ y@@ les and informed cho@@ ices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional perspective is becoming increasingly un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful in understanding the developing nature of pat@@ ter@@ ns of sub@@ stance use in Europe .
in Europe today , pol@@ y@@ drug pat@@ ter@@ ns are the nor@@ m , and the combined use of different substan@@ ces is responsible for , or complic@@ ates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly dev@@ alu@@ ed if they simply open the door for the use of a sub@@ stitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substan@@ ces that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the avail@@ ability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreas@@ es , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and pro@@ portion of treatment demands related to op@@ i@@ oid drugs .
data on dru@@ g@@ related deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreas@@ ing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be di@@ ff@@ using into new populations .
the illi@@ cit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adap@@ t quickly to control measures .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible ou@@ tw@@ ard di@@ ff@@ usion of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use beyond the Czech Republic .
changes in the ec@@ st@@ asy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als , and these efforts may also have important

the enforcement of drug prohibi@@ tion is jud@@ ged by the study to have caused substantial un@@ intended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . geographical dis@@ placement of production and trafficking ) .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial co@@ operation between M@@ ember States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that ech@@ o those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing conver@@ gence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better ref@@ le@@ ction of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursu@@ ed in external agreements and programmes .

evalu@@ ator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of ref@@ le@@ ction in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dis@@ su@@ ade young people from beginning to use drugs by re@@ affir@@ ming the prohibi@@ tion of drug use and in@@ forming young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
most countries could provide data on central government expendi@@ ture , and seven also reported expendi@@ ture by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
in some cases , the final report is a sum@@ m@@ ary of annual implementation re@@ views ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
esti@@ m@@ ating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illi@@ cit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .

in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exemp@@ ts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of sy@@ r@@ inges dis@@ pen@@ sed .

the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
both selec@@ tive and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ c ) .
selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ es with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scar@@ ce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .

national experts estimate that in@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
single or ir@@ regular treatment outcome evalu@@ ations are also reported by some countries .
e@@ ffic@@ acy is ide@@ ally determined by carrying out controlled trials or r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials where interven@@ tions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common , and include some ground @@@ -@@ @ breaking work on new agents for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment .
the new mo@@ dul@@ e also includes : links to other information sources , evalu@@ ated interven@@ tions , a g@@ los@@ s@@ ary and a brief syn@@ op@@ sis of the g@@ aps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases testing and coun@@ selling , vacc@@ ination and treatment of vir@@ al hep@@ ati@@ tis .
all M@@ ember States report the avail@@ ability of housing sch@@ e@@ mes that can accommodate drug users .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at dis@@ rup@@ ting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and sear@@ ches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more gener@@ ic tac@@ tic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing impor@@ tation and expor@@ tation requests as well as identi@@ fying and investigating suspicious transactions .

as with adults , increases in can@@ na@@ bis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
different meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the pre@@ val@@ ence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly can@@ na@@ bis use , have been tested in recent years .
it was estimated that : nearly all those seeking specific treatment would obtain it in France , Greece and Slovenia ; more than half of them in Germany and the United Kingdom ; and only a minority in the remaining eight countries .

cr@@ ack cocaine use in Europe
the first group typically reports s@@ nor@@ ting the drug , and sometimes consum@@ ing it in con@@ jun@@ ction with other substan@@ ces such as alcohol or can@@ na@@ bis , but not with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
for this reason , in Ireland out@@ reach work and other interven@@ tions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly et al . , 2008 ) .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where op@@ i@@ oid users are the main cli@@ en@@ te@@ le . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
according to a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review , this combination has yi@@ elded the best results for the treatment of sti@@ mul@@ ant dependence ( K@@ n@@ ap@@ p et al . , 2007 ) .
in addition , 11 M@@ ember States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 7@@ 35 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported who@@ le@@ sale price of heroin ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 12.@@ 5 to EU@@ R 3@@ 5.@@ 8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 36 to EU@@ R 6@@ 2.7 .
at both who@@ le@@ sale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .

the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Czech Republic , Germany ) .
between 2002 and 2007 , the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among primary op@@ i@@ oid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statisti@@ cally significant dec@@ lines reported in 13 countries .
in France , for example , a decrease in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initi@@ ation of heroin use has become increasingly
national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
its findings highlight the difficulties of compar@@ ative analy@@ ses in this area , under@@ lining the need for a more harmon@@ ised approach for diagnos@@ is , treatment and study of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty in Europe ( Bal@@ d@@ ac@@ ch@@ ino et al . , 2009 ) .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substan@@ ces is not com@@ promised ( Ch@@ ern@@ y et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty were primary op@@ i@@ oid users ( 125 ) .
almost all op@@ i@@ oid users entering treatment report initi@@ ation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .
drug @@@ -@@ @ free and sub@@ stitution treatment for op@@ i@@ oid use are available in all EU M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway . in Turkey , the future use of sub@@ stitution treatment is currently under study .

drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is a ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic approach , which generally requires individuals to abst@@ ain from all substan@@ ces , including sub@@ stitution medi@@ cation .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in sub@@ stitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the avail@@ ability of op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of op@@ i@@ oid users ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
29 % and 60 % , while in Italy , different regional estimates range from around 36 % to 92 % .
the most complete data set available is that for the anti@@ body to the hep@@ ati@@ tis B core anti@@ gen ( anti@@ H@@ B@@ c ) , which indicates a history of infection .
for 2006 @@@ -@@ @ 07 , three of the 10 countries providing data on in@@ j@@ ecting drug users report anti @@@ -@@ @ H@@ B@@ c pre@@ val@@ ence levels of over 40 % ( 13@@ 7 ) .
access to ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment through ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes is reported as a priority by 23 countries , testing and coun@@ selling for inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases by 16 countries and the dis@@ sem@@ ination of information , education and communication material by 14 countries .
to reduce the burden of hep@@ ati@@ tis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chron@@ ic carriers of the virus who are active drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
current treat@@ ments for chron@@ ic hep@@ ati@@ tis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination ther@@ ap@@ y with long@@ acting inter@@ fer@@ on and ri@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ in - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained vir@@ ological response .
the number of sy@@ r@@ inges provided through ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
a national survey conducted in the 120 French " C@@ A@@ AR@@ U@@ D " harm@@ reduction centres showed that they had been used by an estimated 40 000 individuals in 2007 ( T@@ ou@@ fik et al . , 2008 ) .
population mortality rates due to dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced death v@@ ary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 13 ) .
this suggests that the total mortality in this population could be around two to five times the number of registered dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths .
this type of study can determine overall and cause @@@ -@@ @ specific mortality rates for the co@@ h@@ ort , and can estimate the group 's exc@@ ess mortality compared to the general population .
both methods have been successfully pilot @@@ -@@ @ tested in the Czech Republic , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA plans to set up a group of interested countries that could use this work in the near future .
deaths indirectly related to drug use
other diseases that also account for a pro@@ portion of deaths among drug users include chron@@ ic conditions such as li@@ ver diseases ( due to hep@@ ati@@ tis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
other causes have received much less attention , despite indic@@ ations that they have a considerable impact .

in recent co@@ h@@ ort studies in Europe , suicide accounted for 6 % to 11 % of deaths among problem drug users . however , the overall impact of these causes is difficult to assess due to the limited avail@@ ability of data .
drug users are informed about over@@ d@@ ose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abst@@ in@@ ence , the effects and risks of pol@@ y@@ drug use , in particular con@@ com@@ it@@ ant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 5@@ 06 drug over@@ d@@ ose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .

this largely reflects the pan @@@ -@@ @ European production and consumption PA � er@@ ns that are accompan@@ ying the expansion of the EU internal market .
prices are an important factor for ste@@ ering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of us@@ er prices are relevant .

the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
immediately after the hand @@@ -@@ @ over of the ' invent@@ ory ' report , the E@@ EA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culmin@@ ating in the ' Tren@@ ds and projections ' report .
consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total green@@ house gas@@ es emissions in the EU .
next December , a major task of the Co@@ p 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
governments at local and national level , desper@@ ate to boost water supply , are investing in projects such as reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s for st@@ oring water , water transfer and de@@ sal@@ ination plants , which make salt water fit for drinking .

at the same time , agriculture and tourism will require more water especially in the hot@@ ter dri@@ er regi@@ on@@ s.@@ A@@ n increase in water temperatures and lower river flows in the south will also affect water quality .
at a cost of G@@ BP 200m , more than EU@@ R 250m , the facility could supply 140 million lit@@ res of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .

today , the giant ho@@ g@@ we@@ ed is most likely beyond eradi@@ cation in Europe while early actions ( up to the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ) probably would have had better prospects .
the story is set on 27 July 2008 when an air quality warning was issued in Brussels people 's health or the environment has still not been reached .
Anna suffers from as@@ th@@ ma and her doctor has warned of the dangers of air pollution , especially on hot summer day@@ s.@@ Anna has heard about the London fo@@ gs of the 19@@ 5@@ 0s that killed 2 000 people in one week .
mo@@ ther@@ hood and a recent as@@ th@@ ma attack have quite righ@@ tly brought air pollution back to mind .
the air she and Johan bre@@ a@@ the is much improved compared to the past , and air policy is one of the great success stories of the EU 's environmental efforts .

in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the E@@ EA is also preparing an analysis of the C@@ AP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsi@@ dy 's ' environmental ' spending .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , far@@ ming causes almost half of the nit@@ ro@@ gen pollution in rivers , 94 % of am@@ mon@@ ia emissions and 9 % of total green@@ house gas emissions .
the Com@@ mon Agriculture Policy ( C@@ AP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @@@ -@@ @ war food shortages .
the subsi@@ dy has increasingly been dec@@ ou@@ pled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the E@@ EA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
the single farm payments , under P@@ il@@ lar I , are still very much targeted at far@@ ms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .
hydro@@ gen sul@@ p@@ hide is to@@ xic to most life forms , and it was probably a combination of hydro@@ gen sul@@ p@@ hide and lack of ox@@ y@@ gen that killed the Norway lob@@ sters in the Kat@@ te@@ g@@ at that night back in 1986 .
the Bal@@ tic was actually a fres@@ h@@ water lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
sal@@ in@@ ity in the Bal@@ tic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Bal@@ tic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
of the three major f@@ ished species , co@@ d , her@@ ring , and spr@@ at , co@@ d is particularly sensitive to reduced sal@@ in@@ ity because sal@@ in@@ ity affects both their re@@ productive capacity and the avail@@ ability of the preferred food for co@@ d lar@@ va@@ e .
as a result , despite its dep@@ th , it remains well ox@@ y@@ gen@@ ated , even during autumn .

in this context , the E@@ EA has been looking at how the im@@ pending bio@@ energy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
this process har@@ nesses the heat that is a by @@@ -@@ @ product of energy production .
however , a clear message still emer@@ ges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate m@@ iti@@ gation , to pri@@ or@@ iti@@ se bio@@ energy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the ship@@ ment of haz@@ ard@@ ous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment@@ .@@ Electronic waste , which is considered haz@@ ard@@ ous , is an important case .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .

the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shi@@ pped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don '@@ t know whether it is bad for the environment .
