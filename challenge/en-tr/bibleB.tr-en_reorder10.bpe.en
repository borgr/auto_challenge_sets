and the ear@@ th was without form , and vo@@ id ; and d@@ ark@@ ness was upon the face of the deep . and the Spiri@@ t of God moved upon the face of the waters .
and God made the fir@@ mam@@ ent , and divided the waters which were under the fir@@ mam@@ ent from the waters which were above the fir@@ mam@@ ent : and it was so .
and God said , Let the ear@@ th bring forth gr@@ ass , the her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed , and the fruit tree yi@@ el@@ ding fruit after his kind , whose se@@ ed is in itself , upon the ear@@ th : and it was so .
and the ear@@ th brought forth gr@@ ass , and her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed after his kind , and the tree yi@@ el@@ ding fruit , whose se@@ ed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the les@@ ser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly the moving cre@@ ature that hat@@ h life , and fo@@ w@@ l that may fly above the ear@@ th in the open fir@@ mam@@ ent of heav@@ en .
and God created great wh@@ al@@ es , and every living cre@@ ature that mov@@ eth , which the waters brought forth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , after their kind , and every w@@ ing@@ ed fo@@ w@@ l after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made the be@@ ast of the ear@@ th after his kind , and c@@ attle after their kind , and every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and over the c@@ attle , and over all the ear@@ th , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
and God b@@ les@@ sed them , and God said un@@ to them , Be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply , and rep@@ len@@ ish the ear@@ th , and sub@@ due it : and have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and over every living thing that mov@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
and God said , be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b bearing se@@ ed , which is upon the face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every be@@ ast of the ear@@ th , and to every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and to every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , where@@ in there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for meat : and it was so .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
these are the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens ,
and every plant of the field before it was in the ear@@ th , and every her@@ b of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the ear@@ th , and there was not a man to ti@@ ll the ground .
but there went up a mist from the ear@@ th , and wat@@ ered the whole face of the ground .
and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleas@@ ant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the mid@@ st of the gar@@ den , and the tree of knowledge of good and ev@@ il .
and a river went out of E@@ den to water the gar@@ den ; and from th@@ ence it was par@@ ted , and became into four heads .
the name of the first is P@@ ison : that is it which comp@@ ass@@ eth the whole land of Hav@@ il@@ ah , where there is gold ;
and the name of the second river is G@@ ih@@ on : the same is it that comp@@ ass@@ eth the whole land of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
and the name of the third river is H@@ idde@@ kel : that is it which go@@ eth toward the east of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . and the fourth river is E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
and the Lord God took the man , and put him into the gar@@ den of E@@ den to d@@ ress it and to keep it .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il , th@@ ou s@@ halt not eat of it : for in the day that th@@ ou e@@ atest there@@ of th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die .
and A@@ dam gave names to all c@@ attle , and to the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and to every be@@ ast of the field ; but for A@@ dam there was not found an help meet for him .
and the ri@@ b , which the Lord God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her un@@ to the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cle@@ ave un@@ to his wife : and they shall be one f@@ les@@ h .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the mid@@ st of the gar@@ den , God hat@@ h said , Y@@ e shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were nak@@ ed ; and they se@@ wed fi@@ g leaves together , and made themselves ap@@ r@@ ons .
and they heard the voice of the Lord God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day : and A@@ dam and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of the Lord God am@@ on@@ g@@ st the trees of the gar@@ den .
in the swe@@ at of TH@@ Y face s@@ halt th@@ ou eat bread , ti@@ ll th@@ ou return un@@ to the ground ; for out of it w@@ ast th@@ ou taken : for d@@ ust th@@ ou art , and un@@ to d@@ ust s@@ halt th@@ ou return .
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den Cher@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and a f@@ laming s@@ word which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and in process of time it came to pass , that C@@ ain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering un@@ to the Lord .
but un@@ to C@@ ain and to his offering he had not respect . and C@@ ain was very wro@@ th , and his coun@@ tenance fell .
if th@@ ou do@@ est well , s@@ halt th@@ ou not be accepted ? and if th@@ ou do@@ est not well , sin li@@ eth at the door . and un@@ to the@@ e shall be his desire , and th@@ ou s@@ halt rule over him .
and now art th@@ ou Cur@@ sed from the ear@@ th , which hat@@ h opened her m@@ outh to receive TH@@ Y brother 's blood from TH@@ Y hand ;
when th@@ ou til@@ lest the ground , it shall not hen@@ ce@@ forth yield un@@ to the@@ e her strength ; a fugitive and a v@@ ag@@ ab@@ ond s@@ halt th@@ ou be in the ear@@ th .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast driven me out this day from the face of the ear@@ th ; and from TH@@ Y face shall I be hi@@ d ; and I shall be a fugitive and a v@@ ag@@ ab@@ ond in the ear@@ th ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that fin@@ de@@ th me shall s@@ lay me .
and C@@ ain went out from the presence of the Lord , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of no@@ d , on the east of E@@ den .
and C@@ ain knew his wife ; and she conce@@ ived , and b@@ are E@@ no@@ ch : and he buil@@ ded a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , E@@ no@@ ch .
and La@@ me@@ ch took un@@ to him two wi@@ ves : the name of the one was A@@ da@@ h , and the name of the other Zil@@ lah .
and A@@ da@@ h b@@ are J@@ ab@@ al : he was the father of such as d@@ well in ten@@ ts , and of such as have c@@ attle .
this is the book of the generations of A@@ dam . in the day that God created man , in the lik@@ eness of God made he him ;
and A@@ dam lived an hundred and thirty years , and beg@@ at a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image ; and called his name S@@ eth :
and it came to pass , when men began to multi@@ ply on the face of the ear@@ th , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were born un@@ to them ,
that the sons of God saw the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wi@@ ves of all which they chose .
and God saw that the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of man was great in the ear@@ th , and that every imag@@ ination of the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart was only ev@@ il continu@@ ally .
and it re@@ pen@@ ted the Lord that he had made man on the ear@@ th , and it gri@@ ev@@ ed him at his heart .
and the Lord said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ear@@ th ; both man , and be@@ ast , and the cre@@ eping thing , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air ; for it re@@ pen@@ te@@ th me that I have made them .
make the@@ e an Ar@@ k of g@@ opher wood ; rooms s@@ halt th@@ ou make in the Ar@@ k , and s@@ halt pit@@ ch it within and without with pit@@ ch .
and this is the fashion which th@@ ou s@@ halt make it of : the length of the Ar@@ k shall be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , the b@@ read@@ th of it fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of it thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
a window s@@ halt th@@ ou make to the Ar@@ k , and in a cu@@ bit s@@ halt th@@ ou finish it above ; and the door of the Ar@@ k s@@ halt th@@ ou set in the side there@@ of ; with lower , second , and third stories s@@ halt th@@ ou make it .
and , be@@ hold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h , where@@ in is the bre@@ ath of life , from under heav@@ en ; and every thing that is in the ear@@ th shall die .
but with the@@ e will I establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt come into the Ar@@ k , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y wife , and TH@@ Y sons ' wi@@ ves with the@@ e .
and of every living thing of all f@@ les@@ h , two of every sort s@@ halt th@@ ou bring into the Ar@@ k , to keep them alive with the@@ e ; they shall be male and female .
of fo@@ w@@ ls after their kind , and of c@@ attle after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ear@@ th after his kind , two of every sort shall come un@@ to the@@ e , to keep them alive .
and take th@@ ou un@@ to the@@ e of all food that is e@@ aten , and th@@ ou s@@ halt gather it to the@@ e ; and it shall be for food for the@@ e , and for them .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the ear@@ th for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; and every living sub@@ stance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and No@@ ah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wi@@ ves with him , into the Ar@@ k , because of the waters of the flood .
and it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the ear@@ th .
in the six hund@@ red@@ th year of No@@ ah 's life , in the second month , the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , the same day were all the fo@@ un@@ tains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heav@@ en were opened .
in the sel@@ f@@ same day entered No@@ ah , and S@@ hem , and ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h , the sons of No@@ ah , and No@@ ah 's wife , and the three wi@@ ves of his sons with them , into the Ar@@ k ;
they , and every be@@ ast after his kind , and all the c@@ attle after their kind , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind , and every fo@@ w@@ l after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and they went in un@@ to No@@ ah into the Ar@@ k , two and two of all f@@ les@@ h , where@@ in is the bre@@ ath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all f@@ les@@ h , as God had comman@@ ded him : and the Lord shut him in .
and the flood was for@@ ty days upon the ear@@ th ; and the waters increased , and b@@ are up the Ar@@ k , and it was lift up above the ear@@ th .
and the waters prev@@ ailed , and were increased greatly upon the ear@@ th ; and the Ar@@ k went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prev@@ ailed exce@@ ed@@ ingly upon the ear@@ th ; and all the high hil@@ ls , that were under the whole heav@@ en , were covered .
and all f@@ les@@ h died that moved upon the ear@@ th , both of fo@@ w@@ l , and of c@@ attle , and of be@@ ast , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , and every man :
and God remember@@ ed No@@ ah , and every living thing , and all the c@@ attle that was with him in the Ar@@ k : and God made a wind to pass over the ear@@ th , and the waters ass@@ w@@ aged ;
the fo@@ un@@ tains also of the deep and the windows of heav@@ en were stopped , and the rain from heav@@ en was re@@ strained ;
and the waters returned from off the ear@@ th continu@@ ally : and after the end of the hundred and fif@@ ty days the waters were ab@@ ated .
and the Ar@@ k rested in the seventh month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , upon the mountains of Ar@@ ar@@ at .
and the waters decreased continu@@ ally until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days , that No@@ ah opened the window of the Ar@@ k which he had made :
and he sent forth a ra@@ ven , which went forth to and f@@ ro , until the waters were dri@@ ed up from off the ear@@ th .
also he sent forth a do@@ ve from him , to see if the waters were ab@@ ated from off the face of the ground ;
and the do@@ ve came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her m@@ outh was an olive le@@ af p@@ lu@@ ck@@ t off : so No@@ ah knew that the waters were ab@@ ated from off the ear@@ th .
and it came to pass in the six hund@@ red@@ th and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dri@@ ed up from off the ear@@ th : and No@@ ah removed the covering of the Ar@@ k , and looked , and , be@@ hold , the face of the ground was d@@ ry .
and in the second month , on the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , was the ear@@ th dri@@ ed .
bring forth with the@@ e every living thing that is with the@@ e , of all f@@ les@@ h , both of fo@@ w@@ l , and of c@@ attle , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th ; that they may bre@@ ed ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply upon the ear@@ th .
every be@@ ast , every cre@@ eping thing , and every fo@@ w@@ l , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , after their kinds , went forth out of the Ar@@ k .
and No@@ ah buil@@ ded an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord ; and took of every clean be@@ ast , and of every clean fo@@ w@@ l , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar .
and the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you shall be upon every be@@ ast of the ear@@ th , and upon every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , upon all that mov@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , and upon all the fis@@ hes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
and su@@ rely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every be@@ ast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you ; neither shall all f@@ les@@ h be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the ear@@ th .
I do set my bo@@ w in the cl@@ oud , and it shall be for a to@@ ken of a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , when I bring a cl@@ oud over the ear@@ th , that the bo@@ w shall be seen in the cl@@ oud :
and I will remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which is between me and you and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all f@@ les@@ h .
and the bo@@ w shall be in the cl@@ oud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between God and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h that is upon the ear@@ th .
and God said un@@ to No@@ ah , This is the to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which I have established between me and all f@@ les@@ h that is upon the ear@@ th .
and the sons of No@@ ah , that went forth of the Ar@@ k , were S@@ hem , and ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h : and ham is the father of Can@@ a@@ an .
and S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it upon both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , and went back@@ ward , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father ; and their faces were back@@ ward , and they saw not their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
now these are the generations of the sons of No@@ ah , S@@ hem , ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h : and un@@ to them were sons born after the flood .
by these were the is@@ les of the Gen@@ ti@@ les divided in their lands ; every one after his ton@@ gue , after their families , in their nations .
and the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from S@@ id@@ on , as th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to Ger@@ ar , un@@ to Gaza ; as th@@ ou go@@ est , un@@ to So@@ dom , and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ im , even un@@ to L@@ as@@ ha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their ton@@ gues , in their countries , and in their nations .
un@@ to S@@ hem also , the father of all the children of E@@ ber , the brother of Jap@@ het@@ h the el@@ der , even to him were children born .
and un@@ to E@@ ber were born two sons : the name of one was P@@ ele@@ g ; for in his days was the ear@@ th divided ; and his brother 's name was Jok@@ tan .
these are the sons of S@@ hem , after their families , after their ton@@ gues , in their lands , after their nations .
and it came to pass , as they jour@@ ne@@ yed from the east , that they found a pla@@ in in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar ; and they d@@ wel@@ t there .
and they said one to another , G@@ o to , let us make bri@@ ck , and bur@@ n them throug@@ h@@ ly . and they had bri@@ ck for stone , and sli@@ me had they for mor@@ ter .
and they said , G@@ o to , let us build us a city and a to@@ wer , whose top may reach un@@ to heav@@ en ; and let us make us a name , lest we be sc@@ at@@ tered abroad upon the face of the whole ear@@ th .
and the Lord said , be@@ hold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be re@@ strained from them , which they have imag@@ ined to do .
so the Lord sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad from th@@ ence upon the face of all the ear@@ th : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Bab@@ el ; because the Lord did there con@@ found the language of all the ear@@ th : and from th@@ ence did the Lord sc@@ at@@ ter them abroad upon the face of all the ear@@ th .
and Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took them wi@@ ves : the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai ; and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an , the father of Mil@@ ca@@ h , and the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
and Ter@@ ah took Ab@@ ram his son , and lot the son of Har@@ an his son 's son , and Sar@@ ai his daughter in law , his son Ab@@ ram 's wife ; and they went forth with them from U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and they came un@@ to Har@@ an , and d@@ wel@@ t there .
now the Lord had said un@@ to Ab@@ ram , G@@ et the@@ e out of TH@@ Y country , and from TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ red , and from TH@@ Y father 's house , un@@ to a land that I will she@@ w the@@ e :
and I will b@@ less them that b@@ less the@@ e , and cur@@ se him that cur@@ set@@ h the@@ e : and in the@@ e shall all families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
so Ab@@ ram depar@@ ted , as the Lord had spoken un@@ to him ; and lot went with him : and Ab@@ ram was sev@@ enty and five years old when he depar@@ ted out of Har@@ an .
and Ab@@ ram took Sar@@ ai his wife , and lot his brother 's son , and all their sub@@ stance that they had gathered , and the so@@ ul@@ s that they had gotten in Har@@ an ; and they went forth to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and into the land of Can@@ a@@ an they came .
and Ab@@ ram passed through the land un@@ to the place of Sic@@ hem , un@@ to the pla@@ in of Mo@@ re@@ h . and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite was then in the land .
and he removed from th@@ ence un@@ to a mountain on the east of Be@@ the@@ l , and pit@@ ched his tent , having Be@@ the@@ l on the west , and H@@ ai on the east : and there he buil@@ ded an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord , and called upon the name of the Lord .
and there was a fam@@ ine in the land : and Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; for the fam@@ ine was gri@@ ev@@ ous in the land .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said un@@ to Sar@@ ai his wife , be@@ hold now , I know that th@@ ou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall see the@@ e , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save the@@ e alive .
and it came to pass , that , when Ab@@ ram was come into Egypt , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans be@@ held the woman that she was very fair .
the pr@@ inces also of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw her , and commen@@ ded her before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : and the woman was taken into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
why sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou , S@@ he is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore be@@ hold TH@@ Y wife , take her , and go TH@@ Y way .
un@@ to the place of the alt@@ ar , which he had made there at the first : and there Ab@@ ram called on the name of the Lord .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might d@@ well together : for their sub@@ stance was great , so that they could not d@@ well together .
and there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's c@@ attle and the her@@ d@@ men of lot 's c@@ attle : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite d@@ wel@@ led then in the land .
and Ab@@ ram said un@@ to lot , Let there be no stri@@ fe , I pra@@ y the@@ e , between me and the@@ e , and between my her@@ d@@ men and TH@@ Y her@@ d@@ men ; for we be bre@@ th@@ ren .
is not the whole land before the@@ e ? separate th@@ y@@ self , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from me : if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if th@@ ou de@@ part to the right hand , then I will go to the left .
then lot chose him all the pla@@ in of Jordan ; and lot jour@@ ne@@ yed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
and the Lord said un@@ to Ab@@ ram , after that lot was separated from him , L@@ if@@ t up now th@@ ine eyes , and look from the place where th@@ ou art nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard :
and I will make TH@@ Y se@@ ed as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th : so that if a man can number the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , then shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed also be num@@ ber@@ ed .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the b@@ read@@ th of it ; for I will give it un@@ to the@@ e .
and it came to pass in the days of Am@@ ra@@ ph@@ el king of Sh@@ in@@ ar , Ari@@ o@@ ch king of El@@ las@@ ar , Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer king of E@@ lam , and ti@@ dal king of nations ;
that these made war with Ber@@ a king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ s@@ ha king of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Sh@@ ina@@ b king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and She@@ me@@ ber king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a , which is Zo@@ ar .
and they returned , and came to En @@@ -@@ @ mis@@ h@@ p@@ at , which is K@@ ade@@ sh , and smo@@ te all the country of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and also the Am@@ ori@@ tes that d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ ez@@ on @@@ -@@ @ Tam@@ ar .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Ab@@ ram the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the pla@@ in of Mam@@ re the Am@@ or@@ ite , brother of E@@ sch@@ ol , and brother of An@@ er : and these were conf@@ eder@@ ate with Ab@@ ram .
and when Ab@@ ram heard that his brother was taken cap@@ tive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and E@@ igh@@ teen , and pursu@@ ed them un@@ to Dan .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smo@@ te them , and pursu@@ ed them un@@ to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and the king of So@@ dom went out to meet him after his return from the sla@@ ughter of Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer , and of the kings that were with him , at the val@@ ley of Sha@@ ve@@ h , which is the king 's D@@ ale .
and b@@ les@@ sed be the most high God , which hat@@ h delivered th@@ ine enem@@ ies into TH@@ Y hand . and he gave him ti@@ th@@ es of all .
save only that which the young men have e@@ aten , and the portion of the men which went with me , An@@ er , E@@ sh@@ col , and Mam@@ re ; let them take their portion .
and Ab@@ ram said , be@@ hold , to me th@@ ou h@@ ast given no se@@ ed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine he@@ ir .
and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came un@@ to him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine he@@ ir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bo@@ wel@@ s shall be th@@ ine he@@ ir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Lo@@ ok now toward heav@@ en , and tell the stars , if th@@ ou be able to number them : and he said un@@ to him , S@@ o shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed be .
and he took un@@ to him all these , and divided them in the mid@@ st , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sle@@ ep fell upon Ab@@ ram ; and , lo , an hor@@ ror of great d@@ ark@@ ness fell upon him .
and it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , be@@ hold a smoking fur@@ n@@ ace , and a burning lam@@ p that passed between those pieces .
and Sar@@ ai Ab@@ ram 's wife took Hag@@ ar her ma@@ id the Egyptian , after Ab@@ ram had d@@ wel@@ t ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to her husband Ab@@ ram to be his wife .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord found her by a fo@@ un@@ tain of water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , by the fo@@ un@@ tain in the way to Sh@@ ur .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to her , I will multi@@ ply TH@@ Y se@@ ed exce@@ ed@@ ingly , that it shall not be num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to her , be@@ hold , th@@ ou art with child , and s@@ halt bear a son , and s@@ halt call his name I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el ; because the Lord hat@@ h heard TH@@ Y aff@@ li@@ ction .
neither shall TH@@ Y name any more be called Ab@@ ram , but TH@@ Y name shall be Ab@@ ra@@ ham ; for a father of many nations have I made the@@ e .
and I will make the@@ e exceeding fruit@@ ful , and I will make nations of the@@ e , and kings shall come out of the@@ e .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the@@ e and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e in their generations for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , to be a God un@@ to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e .
this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e ; Every man child among you shall be circum@@ c@@ ised .
and ye shall circum@@ c@@ ise the f@@ les@@ h of your fo@@ res@@ kin ; and it shall be a to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant bet@@ wi@@ xt me and you .
he that is born in TH@@ Y house , and he that is bought with TH@@ Y money , must needs be circum@@ c@@ ised : and my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall be in your f@@ les@@ h for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised man child whose f@@ les@@ h of his fo@@ res@@ kin is not circum@@ c@@ ised , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people ; he hat@@ h broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will b@@ less her , and give the@@ e a son also of her : ye@@ a , I will b@@ less her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
and as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard the@@ e : be@@ hold , I have b@@ les@@ sed him , and will make him fruit@@ ful , and will multi@@ ply him exce@@ ed@@ ingly ; twelve pr@@ inces shall he be@@ get , and I will make him a great nation .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's house ; and circum@@ c@@ ised the f@@ les@@ h of their fo@@ res@@ kin in the sel@@ f@@ same day , as God had said un@@ to him .
and the Lord appeared un@@ to him in the pla@@ ins of Mam@@ re : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bo@@ wed himself toward the ground ,
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham ran un@@ to the her@@ d , and f@@ et@@ cht a cal@@ f tender and good , and gave it un@@ to a young man ; and he has@@ ted to d@@ ress it .
and he took but@@ ter , and milk , and the cal@@ f which he had d@@ ressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat .
now Ab@@ ra@@ ham and Sar@@ ah were old and well stric@@ ken in age ; and it ce@@ ased to be with Sar@@ ah after the manner of women .
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come un@@ to me ; and if not , I will know .
and there came two an@@ gel@@ s to So@@ dom at even ; and lot sat in the gate of So@@ dom : and lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bo@@ wed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in un@@ to him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bak@@ e un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and they did eat .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of So@@ dom , comp@@ ass@@ ed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they smo@@ te the men that were at the door of the house with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , both small and great : so that they we@@ ar@@ ied themselves to find the door .
and while he lin@@ gered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; the Lord being mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
be@@ hold now , TH@@ Y ser@@ vant hat@@ h found grace in TH@@ Y sight , and th@@ ou h@@ ast mag@@ ni@@ fied TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to me in saving my life ; and I can@@ not escape to the mountain , lest some ev@@ il take me , and I die :
be@@ hold now , this city is near to flee un@@ to , and it is a little one : O@@ h , let me escape th@@ ither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my sou@@ l shall live .
and he over@@ threw those cities , and all the pla@@ in , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
and he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the mid@@ st of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which lot d@@ wel@@ t .
and lot went up out of Zo@@ ar , and d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters with him ; for he fear@@ ed to d@@ well in Zo@@ ar : and he d@@ wel@@ t in a cave , he and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve se@@ ed of our father .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the fir@@ st@@ born went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger ar@@ ose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
but God came to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch in a dream by night , and said to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ou art but a dead man , for the woman which th@@ ou h@@ ast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
therefore A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their e@@ ars : and the men were sor@@ e afraid .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and it came to pass , when God caused me to w@@ ander from my father 's house , that I said un@@ to her , This is TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness which th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w un@@ to me ; at every place w@@ hi@@ ther we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham called the name of his son that was born un@@ to him , whom Sar@@ ah b@@ are to him , I@@ sa@@ ac .
and she said , Wh@@ o would have said un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , that Sar@@ ah should have given children su@@ ck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was we@@ an@@ ed : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham made a great feast the same day that I@@ sa@@ ac was we@@ an@@ ed .
and God said un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , Let it not be gri@@ ev@@ ous in TH@@ Y sight because of the la@@ d , and because of TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ woman ; in all that Sar@@ ah hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , he@@ arken un@@ to her voice ; for in I@@ sa@@ ac shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed be called .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bo@@ w@@ shot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and we@@ pt .
and God heard the voice of the la@@ d ; and the an@@ gel of God called Hag@@ ar out of heav@@ en , and said un@@ to her , What ail@@ eth the@@ e , Hag@@ ar ? fear not ; for God hat@@ h heard the voice of the la@@ d where he is .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bot@@ tle with water , and gave the la@@ d drink .
and he d@@ wel@@ t in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and P@@ hic@@ hol the chief captain of his host sp@@ ake un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , God is with the@@ e in all that th@@ ou do@@ est :
thus they made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant at Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : then A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and P@@ hic@@ hol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and he said , T@@ ake now TH@@ Y son , th@@ ine only son I@@ sa@@ ac , whom th@@ ou lov@@ est , and get the@@ e into the land of Mor@@ i@@ ah ; and offer him there for a bur@@ n@@ t offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the@@ e of .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham rose up early in the morning , and s@@ add@@ led his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and cla@@ ve the wood for the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and rose up , and went un@@ to the place of which God had told him .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham built an alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar upon the wood .
and he said , lay not th@@ ine hand upon the la@@ d , neither do th@@ ou any thing un@@ to him : for now I know that th@@ ou fear@@ est God , seeing th@@ ou h@@ ast not with@@ held TH@@ Y son , th@@ ine only son from me .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold behind him a ram caught in a th@@ ic@@ ket by his hor@@ ns : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering in the stead of his son .
and said , By myself have I sworn , sa@@ ith the Lord , for because th@@ ou h@@ ast done this thing , and h@@ ast not with@@ held TH@@ Y son , th@@ ine only son :
that in b@@ les@@ sing I will b@@ less the@@ e , and in multi@@ plying I will multi@@ ply TH@@ Y se@@ ed as the stars of the heav@@ en , and as the s@@ and which is upon the sea shore ; and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies ;
and it came to pass after these things , that it was told Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , be@@ hold , Mil@@ ca@@ h , she hat@@ h also born children un@@ to TH@@ Y brother N@@ ah@@ or ;
and Sar@@ ah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old : these were the years of the life of Sar@@ ah .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham stood up , and bo@@ wed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of H@@ eth .
and he commun@@ ed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and in@@ treat for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
that he may give me the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which he hat@@ h , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place am@@ on@@ g@@ st you .
and E@@ ph@@ ron d@@ wel@@ t among the children of H@@ eth : and E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ron ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , current money with the mer@@ chan@@ t .
and after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re : the same is He@@ br@@ on in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the field , and the cave that is there@@ in , were made sure un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place by the sons of H@@ eth .
and I will make the@@ e swe@@ ar by the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , and the God of the ear@@ th , that th@@ ou s@@ halt not take a wife un@@ to my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I d@@ well :
and if the woman will not be willing to follow the@@ e , then th@@ ou s@@ halt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son th@@ ither again .
and the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls of the ca@@ me@@ ls of his master , and depar@@ ted ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , un@@ to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and he made his ca@@ me@@ ls to k@@ ne@@ el down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
be@@ hold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel , son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher upon her sho@@ ul@@ der .
and the dam@@ sel was very fair to look upon , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
and the man won@@ dering at her held his peace , to w@@ it whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
and it came to pass , as the ca@@ me@@ ls had done drinking , that the man took a golden ear@@ ring of half a sh@@ ek@@ el weight , and two brac@@ ele@@ ts for her hands of ten sh@@ ek@@ els weight of gold ;
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who hat@@ h not left de@@ stitute my master of his mer@@ cy and his truth : I being in the way , the Lord led me to the house of my master 's bre@@ th@@ ren .
and the man came into the house : and he un@@ gir@@ ded his ca@@ me@@ ls , and gave stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for the ca@@ me@@ ls , and water to was@@ h his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hat@@ h given him f@@ loc@@ ks , and her@@ ds , and silver , and gold , and men@@ servants , and ma@@ id@@ servants , and ca@@ me@@ ls , and ass@@ es .
and Sar@@ ah my master 's wife b@@ are a son to my master when she was old : and un@@ to him hat@@ h he given all that he hat@@ h .
and he said un@@ to me , The Lord , before whom I walk , will send his an@@ gel with the@@ e , and prosp@@ er TH@@ Y way ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt take a wife for my son of my kin@@ d@@ red , and of my father 's house :
then s@@ halt th@@ ou be clear from this my oath , when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to my kin@@ d@@ red ; and if they give not the@@ e one , th@@ ou s@@ halt be clear from my oath .
be@@ hold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the vir@@ gin co@@ me@@ th forth to draw water , and I say to her , Gi@@ ve me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a little water of TH@@ Y pit@@ cher to drink ;
and she say to me , Bo@@ th drink th@@ ou , and I will also draw for TH@@ Y ca@@ me@@ ls : let the same be the woman whom the Lord hat@@ h appointed out for my master 's son .
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came forth with her pit@@ cher on her sho@@ ul@@ der ; and she went down un@@ to the well , and drew water : and I said un@@ to her , Let me drink , I pra@@ y the@@ e .
and she made has@@ te , and let down her pit@@ cher from her sho@@ ul@@ der , and said , Dr@@ ink , and I will give TH@@ Y ca@@ me@@ ls drink also : so I d@@ rank , and she made the ca@@ me@@ ls drink also .
and I asked her , and said , whose daughter art th@@ ou ? and she said , The daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel , N@@ ah@@ or 's son , whom Mil@@ ca@@ h b@@ are un@@ to him : and I put the ear@@ ring upon her face , and the brac@@ ele@@ ts upon her hands .
and I bo@@ wed down my head , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord , and b@@ les@@ sed the Lord God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter un@@ to his son .
be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah is before the@@ e , take her , and go , and let her be TH@@ Y master 's son 's wife , as the Lord hat@@ h spoken .
and it came to pass , that , when Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's ser@@ vant heard their words , he wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord , bo@@ wing himself to the ear@@ th .
and the ser@@ vant brought forth je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother pre@@ ci@@ ous things .
and they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tar@@ ried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , S@@ end me away un@@ to my master .
and they sent away Re@@ bek@@ ah their sister , and her nur@@ se , and Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's ser@@ vant , and his men .
and they b@@ les@@ sed Re@@ bek@@ ah , and said un@@ to her , T@@ ho@@ u art our sister , be th@@ ou the mother of thousands of millions , and let TH@@ Y se@@ ed poss@@ ess the gate of those which h@@ ate them .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah ar@@ ose , and her dam@@ sels , and they ro@@ de upon the ca@@ me@@ ls , and followed the man : and the ser@@ vant took Re@@ bek@@ ah , and went his way .
and I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the ev@@ enti@@ de : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , the ca@@ me@@ ls were coming .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw I@@ sa@@ ac , she ligh@@ ted off the C@@ ame@@ l .
but un@@ to the sons of the conc@@ ub@@ ines , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham had , Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave gifts , and sent them away from I@@ sa@@ ac his son , while he yet lived , eas@@ tw@@ ard , un@@ to the east country .
and these are the days of the years of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's life which he lived , an hundred thre@@ es@@ core and fif@@ teen years .
then Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave up the gh@@ ost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and his sons I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ;
and it came to pass after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , that God b@@ les@@ sed his son I@@ sa@@ ac ; and I@@ sa@@ ac d@@ wel@@ t by the well La@@ hai @@@ -@@ @ roi .
now these are the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham :
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ a@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ ed@@ ar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
these are the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their c@@ ast@@ les ; twelve pr@@ inces according to their nations .
and these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the gh@@ ost and died ; and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah to wife , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , the sister to Lab@@ an the Syrian .
and the children strugg@@ led together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? and she went to inqu@@ ire of the Lord .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on E@@ sa@@ u 's he@@ el ; and his name was called Jac@@ o@@ b : and I@@ sa@@ ac was thre@@ es@@ core years old when she b@@ are them .
and there was a fam@@ ine in the land , bes@@ ide the first fam@@ ine that was in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham . and I@@ sa@@ ac went un@@ to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines un@@ to Ger@@ ar .
So@@ jour@@ n in this land , and I will be with the@@ e , and will b@@ less the@@ e ; for un@@ to the@@ e , and un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sw@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham TH@@ Y father ;
and I will make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to multi@@ ply as the stars of heav@@ en , and will give un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed all these countries ; and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , be@@ hold , I@@ sa@@ ac was spor@@ ting with Re@@ bek@@ ah his wife .
for all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them , and filled them with ear@@ th .
and I@@ sa@@ ac dig@@ ged again the wel@@ ls of water , which they had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father ; for the phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
and they rose up be@@ times in the morning , and sw@@ are one to another : and I@@ sa@@ ac sent them away , and they depar@@ ted from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dig@@ ged , and said un@@ to him , We have found water .
and E@@ sa@@ u was for@@ ty years old when he took to wife Judi@@ th the daughter of Be@@ eri the H@@ itti@@ te , and B@@ ash@@ em@@ ath the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te :
and it came to pass , that when I@@ sa@@ ac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called E@@ sa@@ u his el@@ dest son , and said un@@ to him , My son : and he said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , here am I@@ .
now therefore take , I pra@@ y the@@ e , TH@@ Y weapons , TH@@ Y qu@@ i@@ ver and TH@@ Y bo@@ w , and go out to the field , and take me some ven@@ ison ;
and make me sav@@ our@@ y meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my sou@@ l may b@@ less the@@ e before I die .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah heard when I@@ sa@@ ac sp@@ ake to E@@ sa@@ u his son . and E@@ sa@@ u went to the field to hunt for ven@@ ison , and to bring it .
go now to the flock , and f@@ et@@ ch me from th@@ ence two good kids of the go@@ ats ; and I will make them sav@@ our@@ y meat for TH@@ Y father , such as he lov@@ eth :
and he went , and f@@ et@@ ched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made sav@@ our@@ y meat , such as his father lov@@ ed .
and Re@@ bek@@ ah took good@@ ly ra@@ im@@ ent of her el@@ dest son E@@ sa@@ u , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jac@@ o@@ b her younger son :
and she put the sk@@ ins of the kids of the go@@ ats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his nec@@ k :
and she gave the sav@@ our@@ y meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jac@@ o@@ b .
and Jac@@ o@@ b went near un@@ to I@@ sa@@ ac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jac@@ o@@ b 's voice , but the hands are the hands of E@@ sa@@ u .
and he said , Br@@ ing it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my sou@@ l may b@@ less the@@ e . and he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he d@@ rank .
and he came near , and k@@ is@@ sed him : and he s@@ mel@@ led the s@@ me@@ ll of his ra@@ im@@ ent , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and said , Se@@ e , the s@@ me@@ ll of my son is as the s@@ me@@ ll of a field which the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed :
let people serve the@@ e , and nations bo@@ w down to the@@ e : be lor@@ d over TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and let TH@@ Y mother 's sons bo@@ w down to the@@ e : Cur@@ sed be every one that cur@@ set@@ h the@@ e , and b@@ les@@ sed be he that b@@ les@@ set@@ h the@@ e .
and it came to pass , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b was yet scar@@ ce gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
and when E@@ sa@@ u heard the words of his father , he cri@@ ed with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said un@@ to his father , b@@ less me , even me also , O my father .
and I@@ sa@@ ac his father answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling shall be the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th , and of the dew of heav@@ en from above ;
and by TH@@ Y s@@ word s@@ halt th@@ ou live , and s@@ halt serve TH@@ Y brother ; and it shall come to pass when th@@ ou s@@ halt have the domin@@ ion , that th@@ ou s@@ halt break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
and these words of E@@ sa@@ u her el@@ der son were told to Re@@ bek@@ ah : and she sent and called Jac@@ o@@ b her younger son , and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y brother E@@ sa@@ u , as tou@@ ching the@@ e , do@@ th comfor@@ t himself , pur@@ posing to kill the@@ e .
and I@@ sa@@ ac called Jac@@ o@@ b , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and charged him , and said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not take a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an .
arise , go to P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , to the house of B@@ eth@@ uel TH@@ Y mother 's father ; and take the@@ e a wife from th@@ ence of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Lab@@ an TH@@ Y mother 's brother .
then went E@@ sa@@ u un@@ to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took un@@ to the wi@@ ves which he had Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , the sister of N@@ eb@@ a@@ jo@@ th , to be his wife .
and he ligh@@ ted upon a certain place , and tar@@ ried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pil@@ lows , and lay down in that place to sle@@ ep .
and he dre@@ amed , and be@@ hold a la@@ d@@ der set up on the ear@@ th , and the top of it reached to heav@@ en : and be@@ hold the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on it .
and , be@@ hold , the Lord stood above it , and said , I am the Lord God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham TH@@ Y father , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac : the land where@@ on th@@ ou li@@ est , to the@@ e will I give it , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed ;
and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall be as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and th@@ ou s@@ halt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in the@@ e and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
and , be@@ hold , I am with the@@ e , and will keep the@@ e in all places w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , and will bring the@@ e again into this land ; for I will not leave the@@ e , until I have done that which I have spoken to the@@ e of .
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pil@@ lows , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Be@@ the@@ l : but the name of that city was called L@@ uz at the first .
and Jac@@ o@@ b vowed a vo@@ w , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and ra@@ im@@ ent to put on ,
and this stone , which I have set for a pil@@ lar , shall be God 's house : and of all that th@@ ou s@@ halt give me I will su@@ rely give the tenth un@@ to the@@ e .
and he looked , and be@@ hold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep lying by it ; for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ loc@@ ks : and a great stone was upon the well 's m@@ outh .
and th@@ ither were all the f@@ loc@@ ks gathered : and they rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the she@@ ep , and put the stone again upon the well 's m@@ outh in his place .
and it came to pass , when Jac@@ o@@ b saw R@@ ach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , and the she@@ ep of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , that Jac@@ o@@ b went near , and rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
and Jac@@ o@@ b told R@@ ach@@ el that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Re@@ bek@@ ah 's son : and she ran and told her father .
and it came to pass , when Lab@@ an heard the ti@@ dings of Jac@@ o@@ b his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embrac@@ ed him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Lab@@ an all these things .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in un@@ to her .
and she conce@@ ived again , and b@@ are a son ; and said , Bec@@ ause the Lord hat@@ h heard that I was ha@@ ted , he hat@@ h therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
and Le@@ ah said , God hat@@ h given me my h@@ ire , because I have given my ma@@ iden to my husband : and she called his name Is@@ sac@@ har .
and it came to pass , when R@@ ach@@ el had born Joseph , that Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to Lab@@ an , S@@ end me away , that I may go un@@ to mine own place , and to my country .
give me my wi@@ ves and my children , for whom I have served the@@ e , and let me go : for th@@ ou know@@ est my service which I have done the@@ e .
for it was little which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st before I came , and it is now increased un@@ to a multi@@ tude ; and the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e since my coming : and now when shall I provide for mine own house also ?
I will pass through all TH@@ Y flock to day , removing from th@@ ence all the spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted c@@ attle , and all the bro@@ wn c@@ attle among the she@@ ep , and the spot@@ ted and spec@@ k@@ led among the go@@ ats : and of such shall be my h@@ ire .
and he removed that day the he go@@ ats that were r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked and spot@@ ted , and all the she go@@ ats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the bro@@ wn among the she@@ ep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and Jac@@ o@@ b took him ro@@ ds of green pop@@ lar , and of the haz@@ el and ches@@ n@@ ut tree ; and pil@@ led white str@@ akes in them , and made the white appear which was in the ro@@ ds .
and he set the ro@@ ds which he had pil@@ led before the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering t@@ rough@@ s when the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink , that they should conce@@ ive when they came to drink .
and Jac@@ o@@ b did separate the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , and all the bro@@ wn in the flock of Lab@@ an ; and he put his own f@@ loc@@ ks by themselves , and put them not un@@ to Lab@@ an 's c@@ attle .
and it came to pass , wh@@ en@@ so@@ ever the stronger c@@ attle did conce@@ ive , that Jac@@ o@@ b laid the ro@@ ds before the eyes of the c@@ attle in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conce@@ ive among the ro@@ ds .
and Jac@@ o@@ b be@@ held the coun@@ tenance of Lab@@ an , and , be@@ hold , it was not toward him as before .
and it came to pass at the time that the c@@ attle conce@@ ived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , be@@ hold , the r@@ ams which le@@ ap@@ ed upon the c@@ attle were r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gr@@ is@@ led .
and he said , L@@ if@@ t up now th@@ ine eyes , and see , all the r@@ ams which le@@ ap upon the c@@ attle are r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gr@@ is@@ led : for I have seen all that Lab@@ an do@@ eth un@@ to the@@ e .
I am the God of Be@@ the@@ l , where th@@ ou ano@@ in@@ ted@@ st the pil@@ lar , and where th@@ ou vo@@ w@@ ed@@ st a vo@@ w un@@ to me : now arise , get the@@ e out from this land , and return un@@ to the land of TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ red .
for all the ri@@ ches which God hat@@ h taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever God hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , do .
and he carried away all his c@@ attle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the c@@ attle of his getting , which he had gotten in P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , for to go to I@@ sa@@ ac his father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and Jac@@ o@@ b st@@ ole away un@@ awar@@ es to Lab@@ an the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou flee away secre@@ tly , and ste@@ al away from me ; and di@@ d@@ st not tell me , that I might have sent the@@ e away with mir@@ th , and with songs , with tab@@ ret , and with har@@ p ?
and h@@ ast not suffered me to k@@ is@@ s my sons and my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ? th@@ ou h@@ ast now done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly in so doing .
and now , though th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest needs be gone , because th@@ ou sor@@ e long@@ ed@@ st after TH@@ Y father 's house , yet where@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou stolen my go@@ ds ?
and Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , and into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the two ma@@ id@@ servants ' ten@@ ts ; but he found them not . then went he out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
now R@@ ach@@ el had taken the images , and put them in the C@@ ame@@ l 's furniture , and sat upon them . and Lab@@ an searched all the tent , but found them not .
and she said to her father , Let it not disp@@ le@@ ase my lor@@ d that I can@@ not rise up before the@@ e ; for the cust@@ om of women is upon me . and he searched , but found not the images .
this twenty years have I been with the@@ e ; TH@@ Y e@@ w@@ es and TH@@ Y she go@@ ats have not cast their young , and the r@@ ams of TH@@ Y flock have I not e@@ aten .
that which was torn of be@@ asts I brought not un@@ to the@@ e ; I b@@ are the loss of it ; of my hand di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
now therefore come th@@ ou , let us make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , I and th@@ ou ; and let it be for a witness between me and the@@ e .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt aff@@ lic@@ t my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , or if th@@ ou s@@ halt take other wi@@ ves bes@@ ide my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness bet@@ wi@@ xt me and the@@ e .
this he@@ ap be witness , and this pil@@ lar be witness , that I will not pass over this he@@ ap to the@@ e , and that th@@ ou s@@ halt not pass over this he@@ ap and this pil@@ lar un@@ to me , for harm .
the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of N@@ ah@@ or , the God of their father , judge bet@@ wi@@ xt us . and Jac@@ o@@ b sw@@ are by the fear of his father I@@ sa@@ ac .
then Jac@@ o@@ b offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his bre@@ th@@ ren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tar@@ ried all night in the mount .
and early in the morning Lab@@ an rose up , and k@@ is@@ sed his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and b@@ les@@ sed them : and Lab@@ an depar@@ ted , and returned un@@ to his place .
then Jac@@ o@@ b was greatly afraid and dist@@ ressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the f@@ loc@@ ks , and her@@ ds , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , into two bands ;
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the mer@@ cies , and of all the truth , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every dro@@ ve by themselves ; and said un@@ to his servants , Pas@@ s over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ xt dro@@ ve and dro@@ ve .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt say , They be TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b 's ; it is a present sent un@@ to my lor@@ d E@@ sa@@ u : and , be@@ hold , also he is behind us .
and so comman@@ ded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the dro@@ ves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak un@@ to E@@ sa@@ u , when ye find him .
and say ye moreover , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b is behind us . for he said , I will appe@@ ase him with the present that go@@ eth before me , and after@@ ward I will see his face ; per@@ ad@@ venture he will accept of me .
and when he saw that he prev@@ ailed not against him , he touched the hol@@ low of his th@@ igh ; and the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sin@@ ew which sh@@ rank , which is upon the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , un@@ to this day : because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew that sh@@ rank .
and Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children un@@ to Le@@ ah , and un@@ to R@@ ach@@ el , and un@@ to the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
and he passed over before them , and bo@@ wed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and Le@@ ah also with her children came near , and bo@@ wed themselves : and after came Joseph near and R@@ ach@@ el , and they bo@@ wed themselves .
take , I pra@@ y the@@ e , my b@@ les@@ sing that is brought to the@@ e ; because God hat@@ h dealt gr@@ ac@@ iously with me , and because I have enough . and he urged him , and he took it .
let my lor@@ d , I pra@@ y the@@ e , pass over before his ser@@ vant : and I will lead on sof@@ tly , according as the c@@ attle that go@@ eth before me and the children be able to en@@ dur@@ e , until I come un@@ to my lor@@ d un@@ to Se@@ ir .
and Jac@@ o@@ b came to S@@ hal@@ em , a city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am ; and pit@@ ched his tent before the city .
and he bought a par@@ cel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for an hundred pieces of money .
and Din@@ ah the daughter of Le@@ ah , which she b@@ are un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , went out to see the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the land .
and when Sh@@ ec@@ hem the son of Ham@@ or the H@@ iv@@ ite , pr@@ ince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and def@@ iled her .
and Jac@@ o@@ b heard that he had def@@ iled Din@@ ah his daughter : now his sons were with his c@@ attle in the field : and Jac@@ o@@ b held his peace until they were come .
and make ye marri@@ ages with us , and give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to us , and take our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to you .
but in this will we consent un@@ to you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circum@@ c@@ ised ;
then will we give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to you , and we will take your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to us , and we will d@@ well with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not he@@ arken un@@ to us , to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man def@@ er@@ red not to do the thing , because he had de@@ light in Jac@@ o@@ b 's daughter : and he was more honour@@ able than all the house of his father .
and Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son came un@@ to the gate of their city , and commun@@ ed with the men of their city , saying ,
only her@@ e@@ in will the men consent un@@ to us for to d@@ well with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circum@@ c@@ ised , as they are circum@@ c@@ ised .
and un@@ to Ham@@ or and un@@ to Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son hear@@ ken@@ ed all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circum@@ c@@ ised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and they sle@@ w Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went out .
they took their she@@ ep , and their ox@@ en , and their ass@@ es , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wi@@ ves took they cap@@ tive , and sp@@ o@@ iled even all that was in the house .
and God said un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , arise , go up to Be@@ the@@ l , and d@@ well there : and make there an alt@@ ar un@@ to God , that appeared un@@ to the@@ e when th@@ ou f@@ led@@ dest from the face of E@@ sa@@ u TH@@ Y brother .
then Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to his household , and to all that were with him , P@@ ut away the st@@ range go@@ ds that are among you , and be clean , and change your gar@@ ments :
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an alt@@ ar un@@ to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b all the st@@ range go@@ ds which were in their hand , and all their ear@@ r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars ; and Jac@@ o@@ b hi@@ d them under the o@@ ak which was by Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b .
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , that is , Be@@ the@@ l , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an alt@@ ar , and called the place El @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ el : because there God appeared un@@ to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
and God said un@@ to him , Th@@ y name is Jac@@ o@@ b : TH@@ Y name shall not be called any more Jac@@ o@@ b , but Israel shall be TH@@ Y name : and he called his name Israel .
and the land which I gave Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac , to the@@ e I will give it , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e will I give the land .
and Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he talked with him , even a pil@@ lar of stone : and he p@@ oured a drink offering there@@ on , and he p@@ oured oil there@@ on .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from Be@@ the@@ l ; and there was but a little way to come to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath : and R@@ ach@@ el trav@@ ailed , and she had hard labour .
and it came to pass , as her sou@@ l was in depar@@ ting , ( for she died ) that she called his name Ben @@@ -@@ @ oni : but his father called him Benjamin .
and it came to pass , when Israel d@@ wel@@ t in that land , that Re@@ ub@@ en went and lay with Bil@@ ha@@ h his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b were twelve :
and the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah , Le@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id ; G@@ ad , and As@@ her : these are the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , which were born to him in P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am .
and I@@ sa@@ ac gave up the gh@@ ost , and died , and was gathered un@@ to his people , being old and full of days : and his sons E@@ sa@@ u and Jac@@ o@@ b buried him .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an ; A@@ da@@ h the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te , and Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on the H@@ iv@@ ite ;
and Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah b@@ are Je@@ ush , and Ja@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah : these are the sons of E@@ sa@@ u , which were born un@@ to him in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves , and his sons , and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and all the persons of his house , and his c@@ attle , and all his be@@ asts , and all his sub@@ stance , which he had got in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jac@@ o@@ b .
for their ri@@ ches were more than that they might d@@ well together ; and the land where@@ in they were st@@ ran@@ gers could not bear them because of their c@@ attle .
these are the names of E@@ sa@@ u 's sons ; Eli@@ p@@ haz the son of A@@ da@@ h the wife of E@@ sa@@ u , Re@@ uel the son of B@@ ash@@ em@@ ath the wife of E@@ sa@@ u .
and these were the sons of Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah , the daughter of An@@ ah the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife : and she b@@ are to E@@ sa@@ u Je@@ ush , and Ja@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah .
these were duk@@ es of the sons of E@@ sa@@ u : the sons of Eli@@ p@@ haz the fir@@ st@@ born son of E@@ sa@@ u ; Duk@@ e Tem@@ an , Duk@@ e O@@ mar , Duk@@ e Z@@ ep@@ ho , Duk@@ e Ken@@ az ,
Duk@@ e Kor@@ ah , Duk@@ e G@@ at@@ am , and Duk@@ e A@@ mal@@ ek : these are the duk@@ es that came of Eli@@ p@@ haz in the land of E@@ dom ; these were the sons of A@@ da@@ h .
and these are the sons of Re@@ uel E@@ sa@@ u 's son ; Duk@@ e N@@ ah@@ ath , Duk@@ e Zer@@ ah , Duk@@ e Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h , Duk@@ e M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the duk@@ es that came of Re@@ uel in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of B@@ ash@@ em@@ ath E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .
and these are the sons of Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah E@@ sa@@ u 's wife ; Duk@@ e Je@@ ush , Duk@@ e Ja@@ al@@ am , Duk@@ e Kor@@ ah : these were the duk@@ es that came of Ah@@ ol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .
and Dis@@ h@@ on , and E@@ zer , and Dis@@ han : these are the duk@@ es of the H@@ ori@@ tes , the children of Se@@ ir in the land of E@@ dom .
and these are the children of Zi@@ be@@ on ; both Aj@@ ah , and An@@ ah : this was that An@@ ah that found the mu@@ les in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , as he f@@ ed the ass@@ es of Zi@@ be@@ on his father .
Duk@@ e Dis@@ h@@ on , Duk@@ e E@@ zer , Duk@@ e Dis@@ han : these are the duk@@ es that came of H@@ ori , among their duk@@ es in the land of Se@@ ir .
and these are the kings that re@@ ig@@ ned in the land of E@@ dom , before there re@@ ig@@ ned any king over the children of Israel .
and Hus@@ ham died , and Had@@ ad the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , who smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
and Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ han@@ an the son of A@@ ch@@ bor died , and Had@@ ar re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pa@@ u ; and his wife 's name was Meh@@ et@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Mez@@ a@@ ha@@ b .
and these are the names of the duk@@ es that came of E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duk@@ e Tim@@ n@@ ah , Duk@@ e Al@@ v@@ ah , Duk@@ e J@@ eth@@ eth ,
for , be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and , lo , my she@@ af ar@@ ose , and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and , be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es stood round about , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to my she@@ af .
and his bre@@ th@@ ren said to him , S@@ halt th@@ ou indeed reign over us ? or s@@ halt th@@ ou indeed have domin@@ ion over us ? and they ha@@ ted him yet the more for his dre@@ ams , and for his words .
and a certain man found him , and , be@@ hold , he was w@@ and@@ ering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seek@@ est th@@ ou ?
come now therefore , and let us s@@ lay him , and cast him into some p@@ it , and we will say , Some ev@@ il be@@ ast hat@@ h dev@@ oured him : and we shall see what will become of his dre@@ ams .
and Re@@ ub@@ en said un@@ to them , shed no blood , but cast him into this p@@ it that is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his co@@ at , his co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a p@@ it : and the p@@ it was empty , there was no water in it .
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , be@@ hold , a company of I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes came from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad with their ca@@ me@@ ls bearing sp@@ ic@@ ery and bal@@ m and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the p@@ it , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Re@@ ub@@ en returned un@@ to the p@@ it ; and , be@@ hold , Joseph was not in the p@@ it ; and he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and they sent the co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be TH@@ Y son 's co@@ at or no .
and all his sons and all his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters rose up to comfor@@ t him ; but he refused to be comfor@@ ted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave un@@ to my son mourning . thus his father we@@ pt for him .
and it came to pass at that time , that Ju@@ da@@ h went down from his bre@@ th@@ ren , and turned in to a certain Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , whose name was H@@ ira@@ h .
and Ju@@ da@@ h saw there a daughter of a certain Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , whose name was Sh@@ u@@ ah ; and he took her , and went in un@@ to her .
and she yet again conce@@ ived , and b@@ are a son ; and called his name She@@ lah : and he was at C@@ he@@ zi@@ b , when she b@@ are him .
and O@@ nan knew that the se@@ ed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in un@@ to his brother 's wife , that he sp@@ il@@ led it on the ground , lest that he should give se@@ ed to his brother .
and in process of time the daughter of Sh@@ u@@ ah Ju@@ da@@ h 's wife died ; and Ju@@ da@@ h was comfor@@ ted , and went up un@@ to his she@@ ep@@ s@@ hear@@ ers to Tim@@ n@@ ath , he and his friend H@@ ira@@ h the Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite .
and she ar@@ ose , and went away , and laid by her v@@ ail from her , and put on the gar@@ ments of her wi@@ do@@ who@@ od .
and it came to pass in the time of her trav@@ ail , that , be@@ hold , tw@@ ins were in her w@@ om@@ b .
and it came to pass , when she trav@@ ailed , that the one put out his hand : and the mid@@ wife took and bound upon his hand a scar@@ let thre@@ ad , saying , This came out first ,
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , which had brought him down th@@ ither .
and the Lord was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and his master saw that the Lord was with him , and that the Lord made all that he did to prosp@@ er in his hand .
and Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him over@@ se@@ er over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
and he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . and Joseph was a good@@ ly person , and well favoured .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Li@@ e with me .
and it came to pass , as she sp@@ ake to Joseph day by day , that he hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his gar@@ ment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she sp@@ ake un@@ to him according to these words , saying , The H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ser@@ vant , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought un@@ to us , came in un@@ to me to mo@@ ck me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , After this manner did TH@@ Y ser@@ vant to me ; that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
but the Lord was with Joseph , and she@@ wed him mer@@ cy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keep@@ er of the prison .
and the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they did there , he was the do@@ er of it .
the keep@@ er of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the Lord was with him , and that which he did , the Lord made it to prosp@@ er .
and it came to pass after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Bak@@ er had off@@ ended their lor@@ d the king of Egypt .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was wro@@ th against two of his officers , against the chief of the but@@ lers , and against the chief of the Bak@@ ers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
and they dre@@ amed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the Butler and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and Joseph came in un@@ to them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , be@@ hold , they were sad .
and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , be@@ hold , a v@@ ine was before me ;
and in the v@@ ine were three branches : and it was as though it bud@@ ded , and her b@@ los@@ s@@ oms shot forth ; and the clu@@ sters there@@ of brought forth ri@@ pe grap@@ es :
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand : and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up th@@ ine head , and restore the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y place : and th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , after the former manner when th@@ ou w@@ ast his Butler .
but think on me when it shall be well with the@@ e , and she@@ w kin@@ d@@ ness , I pra@@ y the@@ e , un@@ to me , and make mention of me un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up TH@@ Y head from off the@@ e , and shall han@@ g the@@ e on a tree ; and the birds shall eat TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h from off the@@ e .
and it came to pass the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast un@@ to all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h dre@@ amed : and , be@@ hold , he stood by the river .
and , be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven well favoured k@@ ine and fat@@ fle@@ shed ; and they f@@ ed in a Me@@ ad@@ ow .
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed ; and stood by the other k@@ ine upon the br@@ ink of the river .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt , and all the wise men there@@ of : and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpre@@ t them un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and we dre@@ amed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dre@@ amed each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream .
and there was there with us a young man , an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpre@@ t .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored un@@ to mine office , and him he han@@ ged .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent and called Joseph , and they brought him has@@ ti@@ ly out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and he sha@@ ved himself , and changed his ra@@ im@@ ent , and came in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to Joseph , I have dre@@ amed a dream , and there is none that can interpre@@ t it : and I have heard say of the@@ e , that th@@ ou can@@ st understand a dream to interpre@@ t it .
and , be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven k@@ ine , fat@@ fle@@ shed and well favoured ; and they f@@ ed in a Me@@ ad@@ ow :
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for bad@@ ness :
and when they had e@@ aten them up , it could not be known that they had e@@ aten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I aw@@ oke .
and the th@@ in e@@ ars dev@@ oured the seven good e@@ ars : and I told this un@@ to the mag@@ ic@@ ians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and the seven th@@ in and ill favoured k@@ ine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty e@@ ars b@@ lasted with the east wind shall be seven years of fam@@ ine .
this is the thing which I have spoken un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : what God is about to do he she@@ w@@ eth un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and there shall arise after them seven years of fam@@ ine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt ; and the fam@@ ine shall consum@@ e the land ;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that fam@@ ine following ; for it shall be very gri@@ ev@@ ous .
and for that the dream was doubled un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up cor@@ n under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land per@@ ish not through the fam@@ ine .
and the thing was good in the eyes of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the eyes of all his servants .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be over my house , and according un@@ to TH@@ Y word shall all my people be ruled : only in the th@@ r@@ one will I be greater than th@@ ou .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to Joseph , Se@@ e , I have set the@@ e over all the land of Egypt .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in ves@@ tures of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ;
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h called Joseph 's name Zap@@ hn@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ pa@@ an@@ e@@ ah ; and he gave him to wife A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Po@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah pri@@ est of On . and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
and un@@ to Joseph were born two sons before the years of fam@@ ine came , which A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Po@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah pri@@ est of On b@@ are un@@ to him .
and the seven years of plen@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of de@@ ar@@ th began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the de@@ ar@@ th was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and the fam@@ ine was over all the face of the ear@@ th : and Joseph opened all the sto@@ re@@ houses , and sold un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and the fam@@ ine wa@@ xed sor@@ e in the land of Egypt .
and he said , be@@ hold , I have heard that there is cor@@ n in Egypt : get you down th@@ ither , and buy for us from th@@ ence ; that we may live , and not die .
and Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren came , and bo@@ wed down themselves before him with their faces to the ear@@ th .
if ye be true men , let one of your bre@@ th@@ ren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry cor@@ n for the fam@@ ine of your houses :
and he turned himself about from them , and we@@ pt ; and returned to them again , and commun@@ ed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph comman@@ ded to fill their s@@ acks with cor@@ n , and to restore every man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he un@@ to them .
and as one of them opened his s@@ ack to give his ass pro@@ ven@@ der in the In@@ n , he es@@ p@@ ied his money ; for , be@@ hold , it was in his s@@ ack 's m@@ outh .
and they came un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b their father un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and told him all that be@@ fell un@@ to them ; saying ,
the man , who is the lor@@ d of the land , sp@@ ake roughly to us , and took us for sp@@ ies of the country .
and the man , the lor@@ d of the country , said un@@ to us , Her@@ e@@ by shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your bre@@ th@@ ren here with me , and take food for the fam@@ ine of your households , and be gone :
and bring your youngest brother un@@ to me : then shall I know that ye are no sp@@ ies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffic@@ k in the land .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , be@@ hold , every man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
and it came to pass , when they had e@@ aten up the cor@@ n which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said un@@ to them , G@@ o again , buy us a little food .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not send him , we will not go down : for the man said un@@ to us , Y@@ e shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and Ju@@ da@@ h said un@@ to Israel his father , S@@ end the la@@ d with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and th@@ ou , and also our little ones .
I will be su@@ re@@ ty for him ; of my hand s@@ halt th@@ ou require him : if I bring him not un@@ to the@@ e , and set him before the@@ e , then let me bear the blame for ever :
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the m@@ outh of your s@@ acks , carry it again in your hand ; per@@ ad@@ venture it was an over@@ sight :
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they commun@@ ed with him at the door of the house ,
and it came to pass , when we came to the In@@ n , that we opened our s@@ acks , and , be@@ hold , every man 's money was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they was@@ hed their feet ; and he gave their ass@@ es pro@@ ven@@ der .
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bo@@ wed themselves to him to the ear@@ th .
and Joseph made has@@ te ; for his bo@@ wel@@ s did ye@@ ar@@ n upon his brother : and he sought where to we@@ ep ; and he entered into his chamber , and we@@ pt there .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans might not eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ; for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and they sat before him , the fir@@ st@@ born according to his birth@@ right , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men mar@@ v@@ elled one at another .
and he took and sent mes@@ ses un@@ to them from before him : but Benjamin 's mes@@ s was five times so much as any of the@@ ir@@ s . and they d@@ rank , and were mer@@ ry with him .
and he comman@@ ded the ste@@ ward of his house , saying , fill the men 's s@@ acks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in his s@@ ack 's m@@ outh .
and put my c@@ up , the silver c@@ up , in the s@@ ack 's m@@ outh of the youngest , and his cor@@ n money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their ass@@ es .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again un@@ to the@@ e out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we ste@@ al out of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house silver or gold ?
and he searched , and began at the el@@ dest , and left at the youngest : and the c@@ up was found in Benjamin 's s@@ ack .
and Ju@@ da@@ h and his bre@@ th@@ ren came to Joseph 's house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and he said , God for@@ bid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the c@@ up is found , he shall be my ser@@ vant ; and as for you , get you up in peace un@@ to your father .
then Ju@@ da@@ h came near un@@ to him , and said , O@@ h my lor@@ d , let TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak a word in my lor@@ d 's e@@ ars , and let not th@@ ine an@@ ger bur@@ n against TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : for th@@ ou art even as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and it came to pass when we came up un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant my father , we told him the words of my lor@@ d .
and we said , We can@@ not go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down : for we may not see the man 's face , except our youngest brother be with us .
and the one went out from me , and I said , su@@ rely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let TH@@ Y ser@@ vant abide instead of the la@@ d a bon@@ d@@ man to my lor@@ d ; and let the la@@ d go up with his bre@@ th@@ ren .
for how shall I go up to my father , and the la@@ d be not with me ? lest per@@ ad@@ venture I see the ev@@ il that shall come on my father .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cri@@ ed , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren .
now therefore be not gri@@ ev@@ ed , nor angry with yo@@ ur@@ selves , that ye sold me hi@@ ther : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hat@@ h the fam@@ ine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be ear@@ ing nor har@@ v@@ est .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a poster@@ ity in the ear@@ th , and to save your lives by a great deliver@@ ance .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hat@@ h made me a father to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lor@@ d of all his house , and a ru@@ ler throughout all the land of Egypt .
has@@ te ye , and go up to my father , and say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith TH@@ Y son Joseph , God hat@@ h made me lor@@ d of all Egypt : come down un@@ to me , tar@@ ry not :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be near un@@ to me , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y children , and TH@@ Y children 's children , and TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks , and TH@@ Y her@@ ds , and all that th@@ ou h@@ ast :
and ye shall tell my father of all my gl@@ ory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall has@@ te and bring down my father hi@@ ther .
and the f@@ ame there@@ of was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren are come : and it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said un@@ to Joseph , S@@ ay un@@ to TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , This do ye ; la@@ de your be@@ asts , and go , get you un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
and take your father and your households , and come un@@ to me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the f@@ at of the land .
now th@@ ou art comman@@ ded , this do ye ; take you w@@ ag@@ ons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wi@@ ves , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them w@@ ag@@ ons , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of ra@@ im@@ ent ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of ra@@ im@@ ent .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten ass@@ es la@@ den with the good things of Egypt , and ten she ass@@ es la@@ den with cor@@ n and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his bre@@ th@@ ren away , and they depar@@ ted : and he said un@@ to them , Se@@ e that ye fall not out by the way .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said un@@ to them : and when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b their father revi@@ ved :
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : and the sons of Israel carried Jac@@ o@@ b their father , and their little ones , and their wi@@ ves , in the w@@ ag@@ ons which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had sent to carry him .
and they took their c@@ attle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and came into Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b , and all his se@@ ed with him :
and these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b and his sons : Re@@ ub@@ en , Jac@@ o@@ b 's fir@@ st@@ born .
and the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h ; E@@ R , and O@@ nan , and She@@ lah , and P@@ har@@ ez , and Zer@@ ah : but E@@ R and O@@ nan died in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . and the sons of P@@ har@@ ez were H@@ ez@@ ron and Ham@@ ul .
these be the sons of Le@@ ah , which she b@@ are un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b in P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , with his daughter Din@@ ah : all the so@@ ul@@ s of his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were thirty and three .
these are the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah , whom Lab@@ an gave to Le@@ ah his daughter , and these she b@@ are un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , even six@@ teen so@@ ul@@ s .
and un@@ to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Po@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah pri@@ est of On b@@ are un@@ to him .
these are the sons of Bil@@ ha@@ h , which Lab@@ an gave un@@ to R@@ ach@@ el his daughter , and she b@@ are these un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b : all the so@@ ul@@ s were seven .
all the so@@ ul@@ s that came with Jac@@ o@@ b into Egypt , which came out of his lo@@ ins , besides Jac@@ o@@ b 's sons ' wi@@ ves , all the so@@ ul@@ s were thre@@ es@@ core and six ;
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s : all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , which came into Egypt , were thre@@ es@@ core and ten .
and he sent Ju@@ da@@ h before him un@@ to Joseph , to direct his face un@@ to Gos@@ h@@ en ; and they came into the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
and Joseph made ready his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ h@@ en , and presented himself un@@ to him ; and he fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
and Joseph said un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and un@@ to his father 's house , I will go up , and she@@ w P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and say un@@ to him , My bre@@ th@@ ren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , are come un@@ to me ;
and the men are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , for their trade hat@@ h been to fe@@ ed c@@ attle ; and they have brought their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , and all that they have .
that ye shall say , Th@@ y servants ' trade hat@@ h been about c@@ attle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fa@@ thers : that ye may d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; for every she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
then Joseph came and told P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said , My father and my bre@@ th@@ ren , and their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and , be@@ hold , they are in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
they said moreover un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , For to so@@ jour@@ n in the land are we come ; for TH@@ Y servants have no pas@@ ture for their f@@ loc@@ ks ; for the fam@@ ine is sor@@ e in the land of Can@@ a@@ an : now therefore , we pra@@ y the@@ e , let TH@@ Y servants d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
and Joseph placed his father and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very sor@@ e , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the cor@@ n which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
and when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans came un@@ to Joseph , and said , Gi@@ ve us bread : for why should we die in TH@@ Y presence ? for the money fail@@ eth .
and they brought their c@@ attle un@@ to Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for hor@@ ses , and for the f@@ loc@@ ks , and for the c@@ attle of the her@@ ds , and for the ass@@ es : and he f@@ ed them with bread for all their c@@ attle for that year .
and as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end there@@ of .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and four parts shall be your own , for se@@ ed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt un@@ to this day , that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h should have the fifth part ; except the land of the pri@@ ests only , which became not P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's .
and Israel d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Egypt , in the country of Gos@@ h@@ en ; and they had pos@@ sessions there@@ in , and grew , and multi@@ p@@ lied exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
but I will lie with my fa@@ thers , and th@@ ou s@@ halt carry me out of Egypt , and bur@@ y me in their bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place . and he said , I will do as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
and said un@@ to me , be@@ hold , I will make the@@ e fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply the@@ e , and I will make of the@@ e a multi@@ tude of people ; and will give this land to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e for an ever@@ lasting possession .
and now TH@@ Y two sons , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which were born un@@ to the@@ e in the land of Egypt before I came un@@ to the@@ e into Egypt , are mine ; as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and TH@@ Y issue , which th@@ ou beg@@ et@@ test after them , shall be th@@ ine , and shall be called after the name of their bre@@ th@@ ren in their inher@@ it@@ ance .
and as for me , when I came from P@@ adan , R@@ ach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come un@@ to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath : and I buried her there in the way of E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath ; the same is B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near un@@ to him ; and he k@@ is@@ sed them , and embrac@@ ed them .
and Joseph brought them out from between his k@@ ne@@ es , and he bo@@ wed himself with his face to the ear@@ th .
and Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near un@@ to him .
and Israel stret@@ ched out his right hand , and laid it upon E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , gui@@ ding his hands wit@@ t@@ ingly ; for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , it disp@@ le@@ ased him : and he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head un@@ to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head .
moreover I have given to the@@ e one portion above TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , which I took out of the hand of the Am@@ or@@ ite with my s@@ word and with my bo@@ w .
unstable as water , th@@ ou s@@ halt not exc@@ el ; because th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test up to TH@@ Y father 's bed ; then def@@ il@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou it : he went up to my cou@@ ch .
O my sou@@ l , come not th@@ ou into their secret ; un@@ to their assembly , mine honour , be not th@@ ou united : for in their an@@ ger they sle@@ w a man , and in their sel@@ f@@ will they dig@@ ged down a wall .
Cur@@ sed be their an@@ ger , for it was fierce ; and their wr@@ ath , for it was cru@@ el : I will divide them in Jac@@ o@@ b , and sc@@ at@@ ter them in Israel .
Ju@@ da@@ h , th@@ ou art he whom TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren shall praise : TH@@ Y hand shall be in the nec@@ k of th@@ ine enem@@ ies ; TH@@ Y father 's children shall bo@@ w down before the@@ e .
Ju@@ da@@ h is a lion 's whel@@ p : from the pre@@ y , my son , th@@ ou art gone up : he sto@@ op@@ ed down , he cou@@ ched as a lion , and as an old lion ; who shall ro@@ use him up ?
binding his fo@@ al un@@ to the v@@ ine , and his ass 's col@@ t un@@ to the choice v@@ ine ; he was@@ hed his gar@@ ments in wine , and his clo@@ th@@ es in the blood of grap@@ es :
Ze@@ bul@@ un shall d@@ well at the ha@@ ven of the sea ; and he shall be for an ha@@ ven of ships ; and his border shall be un@@ to Z@@ id@@ on .
but his bo@@ w abo@@ de in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty God of Jac@@ o@@ b ; ( from th@@ ence is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel : )
even by the God of TH@@ Y father , who shall help the@@ e ; and by the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , who shall b@@ less the@@ e with b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of heav@@ en above , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the deep that li@@ eth under , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the bre@@ asts , and of the w@@ om@@ b :
the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of TH@@ Y father have prev@@ ailed above the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of my pro@@ gen@@ itors un@@ to the ut@@ most bound of the ever@@ lasting hil@@ ls : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the cro@@ wn of the head of him that was separate from his bre@@ th@@ ren .
all these are the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : and this is it that their father sp@@ ake un@@ to them , and b@@ les@@ sed them ; every one according to his b@@ les@@ sing he b@@ les@@ sed them .
and when Jac@@ o@@ b had made an end of comman@@ ding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yi@@ elded up the gh@@ ost , and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and for@@ ty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are em@@ bal@@ med : and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans mour@@ ned for him thre@@ es@@ core and ten days .
and when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph sp@@ ake un@@ to the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pra@@ y you , in the e@@ ars of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying ,
and Joseph went up to bur@@ y his father : and with him went up all the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , the el@@ ders of his house , and all the el@@ ders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , they left in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
and they came to the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of A@@ ta@@ d , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mour@@ ned with a great and very sor@@ e lament@@ ation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place of E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that went up with him to bur@@ y his father , after he had buried his father .
but as for you , ye thought ev@@ il against me ; but God meant it un@@ to good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
and Joseph saw E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's children of the third generation : the children also of Mac@@ hir the son Man@@ as@@ se@@ h were brought up upon Joseph 's k@@ ne@@ es .
so Joseph died , being an hundred and ten years old : and they em@@ bal@@ med him , and he was put in a co@@ ff@@ in in Egypt .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jac@@ o@@ b .
and all the so@@ ul@@ s that came out of the lo@@ ins of Jac@@ o@@ b were sev@@ enty so@@ ul@@ s : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
and the children of Israel were fruit@@ ful , and increased ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and multi@@ p@@ lied , and wa@@ xed exceeding m@@ igh@@ ty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they aff@@ lic@@ ted them , the more they multi@@ p@@ lied and grew . and they were gri@@ ev@@ ed because of the children of Israel .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bon@@ da@@ ge , in mor@@ ter , and in bri@@ ck , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , where@@ in they made them serve , was with ri@@ g@@ our .
and the king of Egypt sp@@ ake to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of which the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah :
and he said , When ye do the office of a mid@@ wife to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women , and see them upon the sto@@ ols ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
and there went a man of the house of L@@ evi , and took to wife a daughter of L@@ evi .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an Ar@@ k of bul@@ rus@@ hes , and da@@ ub@@ ed it with sli@@ me and with pit@@ ch , and put the child there@@ in ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's br@@ ink .
and the daughter of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h came down to was@@ h her@@ self at the river ; and her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ar@@ k among the flags , she sent her ma@@ id to f@@ et@@ ch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , be@@ hold , the bab@@ e we@@ pt . and she had comp@@ as@@ sion on him , and said , This is one of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ' children .
and it came to pass in those days , when Mos@@ es was grown , that he went out un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and looked on their bur@@ den@@ s : and he sp@@ ied an Egyptian s@@ mit@@ ing an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he sle@@ w the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to s@@ lay Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
now the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian had seven da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and they came and drew water , and filled the t@@ rough@@ s to water their father 's flock .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed by reason of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up un@@ to God by reason of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
now Mos@@ es kept the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro his father in law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian : and he led the flock to the back@@ side of the de@@ sert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Ho@@ re@@ b .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord appeared un@@ to him in a fla@@ me of fire out of the mid@@ st of a b@@ ush : and he looked , and , be@@ hold , the b@@ ush burned with fire , and the b@@ ush was not consu@@ med .
moreover he said , I am the God of TH@@ Y father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . and Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and the Lord said , I have su@@ rely seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters ; for I know their sor@@ ro@@ ws ;
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to bring them up out of that land un@@ to a good land and a large , un@@ to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ; un@@ to the place of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites .
now therefore , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel is come un@@ to me : and I have also seen the op@@ pression where@@ with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
come now therefore , and I will send the@@ e un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to God , Wh@@ o am I , that I should go un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to God , be@@ hold , when I come un@@ to the children of Israel , and shall say un@@ to them , The God of your fa@@ thers hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say un@@ to them ?
and God said moreover un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to the children of Israel , The Lord God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial un@@ to all generations .
go , and gather the el@@ ders of Israel together , and say un@@ to them , The Lord God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , of I@@ sa@@ ac , and of Jac@@ o@@ b , appeared un@@ to me , saying , I have su@@ rely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the aff@@ li@@ ction of Egypt un@@ to the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , un@@ to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
and I will stretch out my hand , and sm@@ ite Egypt with all my won@@ ders which I will do in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and after that he will let you go .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall bor@@ row of her neighbour , and of her that so@@ journ@@ eth in her house , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and ye shall sp@@ oil the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , P@@ ut forth th@@ ine hand , and take it by the ta@@ il . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a ro@@ d in his hand :
and the Lord said furthermore un@@ to him , P@@ ut now th@@ ine hand into TH@@ Y bos@@ om . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om : and when he took it out , be@@ hold , his hand was le@@ pro@@ us as snow .
and he said , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand into TH@@ Y bos@@ om again . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om again ; and p@@ lu@@ cked it out of his bos@@ om , and , be@@ hold , it was turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe the@@ e , neither he@@ arken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither he@@ arken un@@ to TH@@ Y voice , that th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the water of the river , and p@@ our it upon the d@@ ry land : and the water which th@@ ou tak@@ est out of the river shall become blood upon the d@@ ry land .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to him , and put words in his m@@ outh : and I will be with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and with his m@@ outh , and will te@@ ach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be TH@@ Y spokesman un@@ to the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to the@@ e instead of a m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be to him instead of God .
and Mos@@ es took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Mos@@ es took the ro@@ d of God in his hand .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , When th@@ ou go@@ est to return into Egypt , see that th@@ ou do all those won@@ ders before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , which I have put in th@@ ine hand : but I will har@@ den his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their aff@@ li@@ ction , then they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people went out , and their officers , and they sp@@ ake to the people , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , I will not give you stra@@ w .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have ye not fulfilled your task in making bri@@ ck both yes@@ ter@@ day and to day , as her@@ et@@ o@@ fore ?
there is no stra@@ w given un@@ to TH@@ Y servants , and they say to us , Mak@@ e bri@@ ck : and , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants are beaten ; but the fault is in th@@ ine own people .
and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in ev@@ il case , after it was said , Y@@ e shall not min@@ ish ought from your bri@@ cks of your daily task .
then the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Now s@@ halt th@@ ou see what I will do to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age , where@@ in they were st@@ ran@@ gers .
and I have also heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge ; and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and I will bring you in un@@ to the land , concerning the which I did swe@@ ar to give it to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , and gave them a charge un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these be the heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses : the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en the fir@@ st@@ born of Israel ; Han@@ o@@ ch , and Pal@@ lu , H@@ ez@@ ron , and Car@@ mi : these be the families of Re@@ ub@@ en .
and the sons of Simeon ; J@@ em@@ uel , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and these are the names of the sons of L@@ evi according to their generations ; Ger@@ sh@@ on , and Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari : and the years of the life of L@@ evi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
and the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h ; Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el : and the years of the life of Ko@@ hat@@ h were an hundred thirty and three years .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to wife ; and she b@@ are him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took him one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el to wife ; and she b@@ are him Ph@@ ine@@ has : these are the heads of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Mos@@ es , to whom the Lord said , Br@@ ing out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which sp@@ ake to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt speak all that I command the@@ e : and Aaron TH@@ Y brother shall speak un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall not he@@ arken un@@ to you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judg@@ ments .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall speak un@@ to you , saying , She@@ w a mir@@ acle for you : then th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to Aaron , T@@ ake TH@@ Y ro@@ d , and cast it before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and it shall become a ser@@ p@@ ent .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and they did so as the Lord had comman@@ ded : and Aaron cast down his ro@@ d before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and before his servants , and it became a ser@@ p@@ ent .
get the@@ e un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in the morning ; lo , he go@@ eth out un@@ to the water ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt stand by the river 's br@@ ink against he come ; and the ro@@ d which was turned to a ser@@ p@@ ent s@@ halt th@@ ou take in th@@ ine hand .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , In this th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord : be@@ hold , I will sm@@ ite with the ro@@ d that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and the fish that is in the river shall die , and the river shall st@@ ink ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall lo@@ the to drink of the water of the river .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron did so , as the Lord comman@@ ded ; and he lifted up the ro@@ d , and smo@@ te the waters that were in the river , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stan@@ k , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt did so with their en@@ chan@@ tments : and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart was har@@ dened , neither did he he@@ arken un@@ to them ; as the Lord had said .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans dig@@ ged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and the river shall bring forth fro@@ gs ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , which shall go up and come into th@@ ine house , and into TH@@ Y bed@@ chamber , and upon TH@@ Y bed , and into the house of TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people , and into th@@ ine ov@@ ens , and into TH@@ Y k@@ ne@@ ad@@ ing@@ t@@ rough@@ s :
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , S@@ ay un@@ to Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with TH@@ Y ro@@ d over the stre@@ ams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the fro@@ gs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
and the fro@@ gs shall de@@ part from the@@ e , and from TH@@ Y houses , and from TH@@ Y servants , and from TH@@ Y people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and the fro@@ gs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and they did so ; for Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand with his ro@@ d , and smo@@ te the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and it became lice in man , and in be@@ ast ; all the d@@ ust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the mag@@ ic@@ ians did so with their en@@ chan@@ tments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon be@@ ast .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; lo , he co@@ me@@ th forth to the water ; and say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not let my people go , be@@ hold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies upon the@@ e , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people , and into TH@@ Y houses : and the houses of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
and I will sever in that day the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , in which my people d@@ well , that no s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies shall be there ; to the end th@@ ou may@@ est know that I am the Lord in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th .
and the Lord did so ; and there came a gri@@ ev@@ ous s@@ warm of f@@ lies into the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was cor@@ rupted by reason of the s@@ warm of f@@ lies .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
be@@ hold , the hand of the Lord is upon TH@@ Y c@@ attle which is in the field , upon the hor@@ ses , upon the ass@@ es , upon the ca@@ me@@ ls , upon the ox@@ en , and upon the she@@ ep : there shall be a very gri@@ ev@@ ous mur@@ rain .
and the Lord shall sever between the c@@ attle of Israel and the c@@ attle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and the Lord did that thing on the mor@@ row , and all the c@@ attle of Egypt died : but of the c@@ attle of the children of Israel died not one .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not one of the c@@ attle of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . and the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was har@@ dened , and he did not let the people go .
and it shall become small d@@ ust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a bo@@ il breaking forth with bla@@ ins upon man , and upon be@@ ast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they took ashes of the fur@@ n@@ ace , and stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; and Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it up toward heav@@ en ; and it became a bo@@ il breaking forth with bla@@ ins upon man , and upon be@@ ast .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for I will at this time send all my plagu@@ es upon th@@ ine heart , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know that there is none like me in all the ear@@ th .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may sm@@ ite the@@ e and TH@@ Y people with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be cut off from the ear@@ th .
and in very de@@ ed for this cause have I raised the@@ e up , for to she@@ w in the@@ e my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the ear@@ th .
be@@ hold , to mor@@ row about this time I will cause it to rain a very gri@@ ev@@ ous ha@@ il , such as hat@@ h not been in Egypt since the foundation there@@ of even until now .
he that fear@@ ed the word of the Lord among the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h made his servants and his c@@ attle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his c@@ attle in the field .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand toward heav@@ en , that there may be ha@@ il in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon be@@ ast , and upon every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d toward heav@@ en : and the Lord sent Th@@ under and ha@@ il , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord ra@@ ined ha@@ il upon the land of Egypt .
so there was ha@@ il , and fire min@@ g@@ led with the ha@@ il , very gri@@ ev@@ ous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the ha@@ il smo@@ te throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and be@@ ast ; and the ha@@ il smo@@ te every her@@ b of the field , and br@@ ake every tree of the field .
only in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , where the children of Israel were , was there no ha@@ il .
In@@ treat the Lord ( for it is enough ) that there be no more m@@ igh@@ ty th@@ under@@ ings and ha@@ il ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands un@@ to the Lord ; and the Th@@ under shall ce@@ ase , neither shall there be any more ha@@ il ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know how that the ear@@ th is the Lord 's .
and Mos@@ es went out of the city from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and spread abroad his hands un@@ to the Lord : and the th@@ unders and ha@@ il ce@@ ased , and the rain was not p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ o in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h : for I have har@@ dened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might she@@ w these my signs before him :
and that th@@ ou may@@ est tell in the e@@ ars of TH@@ Y son , and of TH@@ Y son 's son , what things I have w@@ rought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron came in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , Ho@@ w long w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou refuse to hum@@ ble th@@ y@@ self before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if th@@ ou refuse to let my people go , be@@ hold , to mor@@ row will I bring the loc@@ ust@@ s into TH@@ Y coast :
and they shall cover the face of the ear@@ th , that one can@@ not be able to see the ear@@ th : and they shall eat the resi@@ due of that which is escaped , which remain@@ eth un@@ to you from the ha@@ il , and shall eat every tree which grow@@ eth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill TH@@ Y houses , and the houses of all TH@@ Y servants , and the houses of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; which neither TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , nor TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ' fa@@ thers have seen , since the day that they were upon the ear@@ th un@@ to this day . and he turned himself , and went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and Mos@@ es said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , with our f@@ loc@@ ks and with our her@@ ds will we go ; for we must hold a feast un@@ to the Lord .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand over the land of Egypt for the loc@@ ust@@ s , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the ha@@ il hat@@ h left .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the loc@@ ust@@ s .
and the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very gri@@ ev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
and the Lord turned a m@@ igh@@ ty strong west wind , which took away the loc@@ ust@@ s , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one loc@@ ust in all the co@@ asts of Egypt .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his hand toward heav@@ en ; and there was a th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness in all the land of Egypt three days :
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Y@@ et will I bring one pla@@ gue more upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall su@@ rely th@@ rust you out hence altogether .
speak now in the e@@ ars of the people , and let every man bor@@ row of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . moreover the man Mos@@ es was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h that sit@@ te@@ th upon his th@@ r@@ one , even un@@ to the fir@@ st@@ born of the ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant that is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of be@@ asts .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a do@@ g move his ton@@ gue , against man or be@@ ast : that ye may know how that the Lord do@@ th put a difference between the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and Israel .
and all these TH@@ Y servants shall come down un@@ to me , and bo@@ w down themselves un@@ to me , saying , G@@ et the@@ e out , and all the people that follow the@@ e : and after that I will go out . and he went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in a great an@@ ger .
speak ye un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , a lam@@ b for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lam@@ b , let him and his neighbour next un@@ to his house take it according to the number of the so@@ ul@@ s ; every man according to his e@@ ating shall make your count for the lam@@ b .
your lam@@ b shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the she@@ ep , or from the go@@ ats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the up@@ per door post of the houses , where@@ in they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the f@@ les@@ h in that night , ro@@ ast with fire , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; and with bitter her@@ bs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor so@@ dden at all with water , but ro@@ ast with fire ; his head with his leg@@ s , and with the pur@@ tenance there@@ of .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remain@@ eth of it until the morning ye shall bur@@ n with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your lo@@ ins gir@@ ded , your sho@@ es on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in has@@ te : it is the Lord 's pass@@ over .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will sm@@ ite all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and be@@ ast ; and against all the go@@ ds of Egypt I will exec@@ ute judgment : I am the Lord .
seven days shall ye eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away le@@ av@@ en out of your houses : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever e@@ ate@@ th le@@ av@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this sel@@ f@@ same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
seven days shall there be no le@@ av@@ en found in your houses : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever e@@ ate@@ th that which is le@@ av@@ ened , even that sou@@ l shall be cut off from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , whether he be a st@@ ran@@ ger , or born in the land .
and ye shall take a bun@@ ch of hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ on , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ on ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
for the Lord will pass through to sm@@ ite the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and when he se@@ eth the blood upon the lin@@ tel , and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destro@@ yer to come in un@@ to your houses to sm@@ ite you .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hat@@ h promised , that ye shall keep this service .
that ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lord 's pass@@ over , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smo@@ te the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and delivered our houses . and the people bo@@ wed the head and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es and Aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smo@@ te all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ o@@ ah that sat on his th@@ r@@ one un@@ to the fir@@ st@@ born of the cap@@ tive that was in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of c@@ attle .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and he called for Mos@@ es and Aaron by night , and said , R@@ ise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the Lord , as ye have said .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in has@@ te ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the children of Israel did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and they borro@@ wed of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent :
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , so that they l@@ ent un@@ to them such things as they required . and they sp@@ o@@ iled the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not le@@ av@@ ened ; because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
now the so@@ jour@@ ning of the children of Israel , who d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the sel@@ f@@ same day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed un@@ to the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
but every man 's ser@@ vant that is bought for money , when th@@ ou h@@ ast circum@@ c@@ ised him , then shall he eat there@@ of .
in one house shall it be e@@ aten ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not carry forth ought of the f@@ les@@ h abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone there@@ of .
and it came to pass the sel@@ f@@ same day , that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Re@@ member this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place : there shall no le@@ av@@ ened bread be e@@ aten .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring the@@ e into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers to give the@@ e , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , that th@@ ou s@@ halt keep this service in this month .
Un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten seven days ; and there shall no le@@ av@@ ened bread be seen with the@@ e , neither shall there be le@@ av@@ en seen with the@@ e in all TH@@ Y quarters .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w TH@@ Y son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the Lord did un@@ to me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be for a sign un@@ to the@@ e upon th@@ ine hand , and for a memorial between th@@ ine eyes , that the Lord 's law may be in TH@@ Y m@@ outh : for with a strong hand hat@@ h the Lord brought the@@ e out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring the@@ e into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , as he sw@@ are un@@ to the@@ e and to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , and shall give it the@@ e ,
that th@@ ou s@@ halt set apart un@@ to the Lord all that open@@ eth the mat@@ ri@@ x , and every fir@@ st@@ ling that co@@ me@@ th of a be@@ ast which th@@ ou h@@ ast ; the mal@@ es shall be the Lord 's .
and every fir@@ st@@ ling of an ass th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ de@@ em with a lam@@ b ; and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not re@@ de@@ em it , then th@@ ou s@@ halt break his nec@@ k : and all the fir@@ st@@ born of man among TH@@ Y children s@@ halt th@@ ou re@@ de@@ em .
and it shall be when TH@@ Y son ask@@ eth the@@ e in time to come , saying , What is this ? that th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to him , By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge :
but God led the people about , through the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up har@@ n@@ essed out of the land of Egypt .
and they took their journey from Suc@@ co@@ th , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Eth@@ am , in the edge of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and the Lord went before them by day in a pil@@ lar of a cl@@ oud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
he took not away the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud by day , nor the pil@@ lar of fire by night , from before the people .
and I will har@@ den P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his host ; that the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans may know that I am the Lord . and they did so .
and the Lord har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
and when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew n@@ igh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans mar@@ ched after them ; and they were sor@@ e afraid : and the children of Israel cri@@ ed out un@@ to the Lord .
and they said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Bec@@ ause there were no graves in Egypt , h@@ ast th@@ ou taken us away to die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ? where@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell the@@ e in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , than that we should die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Fe@@ ar ye not , stand still , and see the sal@@ vation of the Lord , which he will she@@ w to you to day : for the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
but lift th@@ ou up TH@@ Y ro@@ d , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on d@@ ry ground through the mid@@ st of the sea .
and I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his host , upon his char@@ i@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ se@@ men .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea d@@ ry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea upon the d@@ ry ground : and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed , and went in after them to the mid@@ st of the sea , even all P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hor@@ ses , his char@@ i@@ ots , and his hor@@ se@@ men .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked un@@ to the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans through the pil@@ lar of fire and of the cl@@ oud , and troubled the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it ; and the Lord over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
and the waters returned , and covered the char@@ i@@ ots , and the hor@@ se@@ men , and all the host of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h that came into the sea after them ; there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked upon d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus the Lord sav@@ ed Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and Israel saw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans dead upon the sea shore .
then san@@ g Mos@@ es and the children of Israel this song un@@ to the Lord , and sp@@ ake , saying , I will sing un@@ to the Lord , for he hat@@ h tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously : the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der hat@@ h he thrown into the sea .
the Lord is my strength and song , and he is become my sal@@ vation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habi@@ tation ; my father 's God , and I will ex@@ alt him .
and in the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy th@@ ou h@@ ast over@@ thrown them that rose up against the@@ e : th@@ ou sen@@ test forth TH@@ Y wr@@ ath , which consu@@ med them as st@@ ub@@ ble .
and with the blast of TH@@ Y nos@@ tr@@ ils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood u@@ pri@@ ght as an he@@ ap , and the dep@@ ths were con@@ ge@@ aled in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , I will pursue , I will over@@ take , I will divide the sp@@ oil ; my l@@ ust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my s@@ word , my hand shall destroy them .
T@@ ho@@ u in TH@@ Y mer@@ cy h@@ ast led forth the people which th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed : th@@ ou h@@ ast gui@@ ded them in TH@@ Y strength un@@ to TH@@ Y hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
then the duk@@ es of E@@ dom shall be amaz@@ ed ; the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Mo@@ a@@ b , tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Can@@ a@@ an shall mel@@ t away .
fear and dre@@ ad shall fall upon them ; by the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; ti@@ ll TH@@ Y people pass over , O Lord , ti@@ ll the people pass over , which th@@ ou h@@ ast purchased .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , in the place , O Lord , which th@@ ou h@@ ast made for the@@ e to d@@ well in , in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , O Lord , which TH@@ Y hands have established .
for the hor@@ se of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h went in with his char@@ i@@ ots and with his hor@@ se@@ men into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the sister of Aaron , took a tim@@ bre@@ l in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tim@@ bre@@ ls and with dan@@ ces .
so Mos@@ es brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Sh@@ ur ; and they went three days in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and found no water .
and he cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord ; and the Lord she@@ wed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made swe@@ et : there he made for them a statute and an ordin@@ ance , and there he proved them ,
and they took their journey from E@@ lim , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel came un@@ to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , which is between E@@ lim and S@@ ina@@ i , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the second month after their depar@@ ting out of the land of Egypt .
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and Aaron in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness :
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron said un@@ to all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the Lord hat@@ h brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the gl@@ ory of the Lord ; for that he he@@ aret@@ h your mur@@ mur@@ ings against the Lord : and what are we , that ye mur@@ mur against us ?
and it came to pass , as Aaron sp@@ ake un@@ to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the cl@@ oud .
I have heard the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel : speak un@@ to them , saying , At even ye shall eat f@@ les@@ h , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God .
and it came to pass , that at even the qu@@ ails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , be@@ hold , upon the face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness there lay a small round thing , as small as the ho@@ ar F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
this is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , G@@ ather of it every man according to his e@@ ating , an O@@ mer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his ten@@ ts .
and when they did M@@ ete it with an O@@ mer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to Mos@@ es ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and stan@@ k : and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with them .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for one man : and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation came and told Mos@@ es .
and they laid it up ti@@ ll the morning , as Mos@@ es b@@ ade : and it did not st@@ ink , neither was there any wor@@ m there@@ in .
and it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
see , for that the Lord hat@@ h given you the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , therefore he gi@@ vet@@ h you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the house of Israel called the name there@@ of Man@@ na : and it was like cor@@ i@@ ander se@@ ed , white ; and the tas@@ te of it was like w@@ af@@ ers made with hon@@ ey .
and the children of Israel did eat man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat man@@ na , until they came un@@ to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , after their jour@@ neys , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , and pit@@ ched in Rep@@ hi@@ dim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
and the people thir@@ s@@ ted there for water ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es , and said , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore is this that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our c@@ attle with thir@@ st ?
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ o on before the people , and take with the@@ e of the el@@ ders of Israel ; and TH@@ Y ro@@ d , where@@ with th@@ ou smo@@ test the river , take in th@@ ine hand , and go .
be@@ hold , I will stand before the@@ e there upon the rock in Ho@@ re@@ b ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Mos@@ es did so in the sight of the el@@ ders of Israel .
so Jos@@ hua did as Mos@@ es had said to him , and fought with A@@ mal@@ ek : and Mos@@ es , Aaron , and H@@ ur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed : and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , W@@ r@@ ite this for a memorial in a book , and re@@ hear@@ se it in the e@@ ars of Jos@@ hua : for I will ut@@ ter@@ ly put out the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of A@@ mal@@ ek from under heav@@ en .
when J@@ eth@@ ro , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , Mos@@ es ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Mos@@ es , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife un@@ to Mos@@ es into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where he en@@ camp@@ ed at the mount of God :
and Mos@@ es went out to meet his father in law , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and k@@ is@@ sed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Mos@@ es told his father in law all that the Lord had done un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and J@@ eth@@ ro re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the Go@@ od@@ ness which the Lord had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and J@@ eth@@ ro said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , who hat@@ h delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , who hat@@ h delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God : and Aaron came , and all the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father in law before God .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Mos@@ es sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Mos@@ es from the morning un@@ to the evening .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ il@@ t su@@ rely wear away , both th@@ ou , and this people that is with the@@ e : for this thing is too heavy for the@@ e ; th@@ ou art not able to perform it th@@ y@@ self alone .
Hear@@ ken now un@@ to my voice , I will give the@@ e coun@@ sel , and God shall be with the@@ e : be th@@ ou for the people to God@@ ward , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring the causes un@@ to God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt te@@ ach them ord@@ inan@@ ces and laws , and s@@ halt she@@ w them the way where@@ in they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover th@@ ou s@@ halt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , h@@ ating c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and place such over them , to be rul@@ ers of thousands , and rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens :
and let them judge the people at all se@@ as@@ ons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring un@@ to the@@ e , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for th@@ y@@ self , and they shall bear the burden with the@@ e .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt do this thing , and God command the@@ e so , then th@@ ou s@@ halt be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
and Mos@@ es chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rul@@ ers of thousands , rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
for they were depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and were come to the de@@ sert of S@@ ina@@ i , and had pit@@ ched in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel camp@@ ed before the mount .
and Mos@@ es went up un@@ to God , and the Lord called un@@ to him out of the mountain , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel ;
Y@@ e have seen what I did un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and how I b@@ are you on e@@ ag@@ les ' w@@ ings , and brought you un@@ to myself .
now therefore , if ye will obe@@ y my voice indeed , and keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , then ye shall be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure un@@ to me above all people : for all the ear@@ th is mine :
and Mos@@ es came and called for the el@@ ders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord comman@@ ded him .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set bo@@ unds un@@ to the people round about , saying , T@@ ake heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth the mount shall be su@@ rely put to death :
and Mos@@ es brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the ne@@ ther part of the mount .
and when the voice of the tr@@ ump@@ et so@@ unded long , and wa@@ xed l@@ ou@@ der and l@@ ou@@ der , Mos@@ es sp@@ ake , and God answ@@ ered him by a voice .
and the Lord came down upon mount S@@ ina@@ i , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Mos@@ es up to the top of the mount ; and Mos@@ es went up .
and the Lord said un@@ to him , away , get the@@ e down , and th@@ ou s@@ halt come up , th@@ ou , and Aaron with the@@ e : but let not the pri@@ ests and the people break through to come up un@@ to the Lord , lest he break forth upon them .
I am the Lord TH@@ Y God , which have brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make un@@ to the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not bo@@ w down th@@ y@@ self to them , nor serve them : for I the Lord TH@@ Y God am a Je@@ al@@ ous God , visiting the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers upon the children un@@ to the third and fourth generation of them that h@@ ate me ;
but the seventh day is the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath of the Lord TH@@ Y God : in it th@@ ou s@@ halt not do any work , th@@ ou , nor TH@@ Y son , nor TH@@ Y daughter , TH@@ Y man@@ ser@@ vant , nor TH@@ Y ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , nor TH@@ Y c@@ attle , nor TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ ger that is within TH@@ Y gates :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt not c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's wife , nor his man@@ ser@@ vant , nor his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , nor his o@@ x , nor his ass , nor any thing that is TH@@ Y neighbour 's .
and all the people saw the th@@ under@@ ings , and the ligh@@ t@@ nings , and the no@@ ise of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood af@@ ar off .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ us th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to the children of Israel , Y@@ e have seen that I have talked with you from heav@@ en .
an alt@@ ar of ear@@ th th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to me , and s@@ halt sacrifice there@@ on TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and TH@@ Y peace offer@@ ings , TH@@ Y she@@ ep , and th@@ ine ox@@ en : in all places where I record my name I will come un@@ to the@@ e , and I will b@@ less the@@ e .
and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t make me an alt@@ ar of stone , th@@ ou s@@ halt not build it of he@@ wn stone : for if th@@ ou lift up TH@@ Y tool upon it , th@@ ou h@@ ast pollu@@ ted it .
if he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
if she ple@@ ase not her master , who hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her un@@ to a st@@ range nation he shall have no power , seeing he hat@@ h dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully with her .
and if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint the@@ e a place w@@ hi@@ ther he shall flee .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smo@@ te him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly he@@ aled .
and if a man sm@@ ite his ser@@ vant , or his ma@@ id , with a ro@@ d , and he die under his hand ; he shall be su@@ rely punished .
and if a man sm@@ ite the eye of his ser@@ vant , or the eye of his ma@@ id , that it per@@ ish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
and if he sm@@ ite out his man@@ ser@@ vant 's to@@ o@@ th , or his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant 's to@@ o@@ th ; he shall let him go free for his to@@ o@@ th 's sake .
if an o@@ x G@@ ore a man or a woman , that they die : then the o@@ x shall be su@@ rely st@@ oned , and his f@@ les@@ h shall not be e@@ aten ; but the owner of the o@@ x shall be quit .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ran@@ so@@ m of his life wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is laid upon him .
whether he have go@@ red a son , or have go@@ red a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done un@@ to him .
the owner of the p@@ it shall make it good , and give money un@@ to the owner of them ; and the dead be@@ ast shall be his .
and if one man 's o@@ x hurt another 's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live o@@ x , and divide the money of it ; and the dead o@@ x also they shall divide .
or if it be known that the o@@ x hat@@ h used to push in time past , and his owner hat@@ h not kept him in ; he shall su@@ rely pay o@@ x for o@@ x ; and the dead shall be his own .
if fire break out , and catch in thor@@ ns , so that the st@@ acks of cor@@ n , or the standing cor@@ n , or the field , be consu@@ med there@@ with ; he that kin@@ d@@ led the fire shall su@@ rely make restitution .
if a man shall deliver un@@ to his neighbour money or stu@@ ff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man 's house ; if the th@@ i@@ ef be found , let him pay double .
if the th@@ i@@ ef be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought un@@ to the judges , to see whether he have put his hand un@@ to his neighbour 's goods .
if a man deliver un@@ to his neighbour an ass , or an o@@ x , or a she@@ ep , or any be@@ ast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , no man seeing it :
then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both , that he hat@@ h not put his hand un@@ to his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept there@@ of , and he shall not make it good .
and if a man bor@@ row ought of his neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner there@@ of being not with it , he shall su@@ rely make it good .
if th@@ ou aff@@ lic@@ t them in any wise , and they cry at all un@@ to me , I will su@@ rely hear their cry ;
and my wr@@ ath shall wa@@ x hot , and I will kill you with the s@@ word ; and your wi@@ ves shall be wi@@ dows , and your children fa@@ ther@@ less .
if th@@ ou lend money to any of my people that is poor by the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be to him as an usu@@ rer , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou lay upon him us@@ ury .
if th@@ ou at all take TH@@ Y neighbour 's ra@@ im@@ ent to pledge , th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver it un@@ to him by that the sun go@@ eth down :
for that is his covering only , it is his ra@@ im@@ ent for his s@@ kin : where@@ in shall he sle@@ ep ? and it shall come to pass , when he cri@@ eth un@@ to me , that I will hear ; for I am gr@@ ac@@ ious .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not delay to offer the first of TH@@ Y ri@@ pe fru@@ its , and of TH@@ Y liqu@@ ors : the fir@@ st@@ born of TH@@ Y sons s@@ halt th@@ ou give un@@ to me .
likewise s@@ halt th@@ ou do with th@@ ine ox@@ en , and with TH@@ Y she@@ ep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day th@@ ou s@@ halt give it me .
six days th@@ ou s@@ halt do TH@@ Y work , and on the seventh day th@@ ou s@@ halt rest : that th@@ ine o@@ x and th@@ ine ass may rest , and the son of TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id , and the st@@ ran@@ ger , may be ref@@ res@@ hed .
and in all things that I have said un@@ to you be circum@@ sp@@ ect : and make no mention of the name of other go@@ ds , neither let it be heard out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt keep the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : ( th@@ ou s@@ halt eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days , as I comman@@ ded the@@ e , in the time appointed of the month A@@ bi@@ b ; for in it th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st out from Egypt : and none shall appear before me empty : )
the first of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of TH@@ Y land th@@ ou s@@ halt bring into the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God . T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not se@@ e@@ the a k@@ id in his mother 's milk .
be@@ hold , I send an Angel before the@@ e , to keep the@@ e in the way , and to bring the@@ e into the place which I have prepared .
but if th@@ ou s@@ halt indeed obe@@ y his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy un@@ to th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and an ad@@ versary un@@ to th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries .
for mine Angel shall go before the@@ e , and bring the@@ e in un@@ to the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites : and I will cut them off .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not bo@@ w down to their go@@ ds , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but th@@ ou s@@ halt ut@@ ter@@ ly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall b@@ less TH@@ Y bread , and TH@@ Y water ; and I will take si@@ ck@@ ness away from the mid@@ st of the@@ e .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be bar@@ ren , in TH@@ Y land : the number of TH@@ Y days I will fulfil .
I will send my fear before the@@ e , and will destroy all the people to whom th@@ ou s@@ halt come , and I will make all th@@ ine enem@@ ies turn their backs un@@ to the@@ e .
and I will send hor@@ n@@ ets before the@@ e , which shall drive out the H@@ iv@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , from before the@@ e .
and I will set TH@@ Y bo@@ unds from the Red sea even un@@ to the sea of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from the de@@ sert un@@ to the river : for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt drive them out before the@@ e .

and he gave un@@ to Mos@@ es , when he had made an end of commun@@ ing with him upon mount S@@ ina@@ i , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the fin@@ ger of God .
and Aaron said un@@ to them , Bre@@ ak off the golden ear@@ r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them un@@ to me .
and all the people br@@ ake off the golden ear@@ r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars , and brought them un@@ to Aaron .
and he received them at their hand , and fas@@ hi@@ oned it with a gra@@ ving tool , after he had made it a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : and they said , These be TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Israel , which brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
and they rose up early on the mor@@ row , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and brought peace offer@@ ings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I comman@@ ded them : they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shi@@ pped it , and have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there@@ un@@ to , and said , These be TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Israel , which have brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
and Mos@@ es bes@@ ought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why do@@ th TH@@ Y wr@@ ath wa@@ x hot against TH@@ Y people , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans speak , and say , For mis@@ chief did he bring them out , to s@@ lay them in the mountains , and to consum@@ e them from the face of the ear@@ th ? turn from TH@@ Y fierce wr@@ ath , and rep@@ ent of this ev@@ il against TH@@ Y people .
and Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , Gra@@ ven upon the tables .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that sh@@ out for mas@@ tery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the no@@ ise of them that sing do I hear .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came n@@ igh un@@ to the camp , that he saw the cal@@ f , and the dan@@ cing : and Mos@@ es ' an@@ ger wa@@ xed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and br@@ ake them ben@@ e@@ ath the mount .
and he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it in the fire , and ground it to pow@@ der , and stra@@ wed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said un@@ to me , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
and I said un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this cal@@ f .
then Mos@@ es stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Wh@@ o is on the Lord 's side ? let him come un@@ to me . and all the sons of L@@ evi gathered themselves together un@@ to him .
and he said un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , P@@ ut every man his s@@ word by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and s@@ lay every man his brother , and every man his compan@@ ion , and every man his neighbour .
and the children of L@@ evi did according to the word of Mos@@ es : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Y@@ e have sin@@ ned a great sin : and now I will go up un@@ to the Lord ; per@@ ad@@ venture I shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for your sin .
yet now , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t for@@ give their sin@@ -- ; and if not , blo@@ t me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of TH@@ Y book which th@@ ou h@@ ast written .
therefore now go , lead the people un@@ to the place of which I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : be@@ hold , mine Angel shall go before the@@ e : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , de@@ part , and go up hence , th@@ ou and the people which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought up out of the land of Egypt , un@@ to the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed will I give it :
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es went out un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Mos@@ es , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Mos@@ es entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar des@@ cen@@ ded , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the Lord talked with Mos@@ es .
and all the people saw the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar stand at the tab@@ ern@@ acle door : and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ pped , every man in his tent door .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es face to face , as a man speak@@ eth un@@ to his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his ser@@ vant Jos@@ hua , the son of nun , a young man , depar@@ ted not out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , if I have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , she@@ w me now TH@@ Y way , that I may know the@@ e , that I may find grace in TH@@ Y sight : and consider that this nation is TH@@ Y people .
and he said , I will make all my Go@@ od@@ ness pass before the@@ e , and I will procla@@ im the name of the Lord before the@@ e ; and will be gr@@ ac@@ ious to whom I will be gr@@ ac@@ ious , and will she@@ w mer@@ cy on whom I will she@@ w mer@@ cy .
and it shall come to pass , while my gl@@ ory pass@@ eth by , that I will put the@@ e in a cli@@ ft of the rock , and will cover the@@ e with my hand while I pass by :
and I will take away mine hand , and th@@ ou s@@ halt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , H@@ ew the@@ e two tables of stone like un@@ to the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning un@@ to mount S@@ ina@@ i , and present th@@ y@@ self there to me in the top of the mount .
and he he@@ wed two tables of stone like un@@ to the first ; and Mos@@ es rose up early in the morning , and went up un@@ to mount S@@ ina@@ i , as the Lord had comman@@ ded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
observe th@@ ou that which I command the@@ e this day : be@@ hold , I drive out before the@@ e the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
take heed to th@@ y@@ self , lest th@@ ou make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e :
L@@ est th@@ ou make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds , and do sacrifice un@@ to their go@@ ds , and one call the@@ e , and th@@ ou eat of his sacrifice ;
and th@@ ou take of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to TH@@ Y sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds , and make TH@@ Y sons go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds .
the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread s@@ halt th@@ ou keep . seven days th@@ ou s@@ halt eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , as I comman@@ ded the@@ e , in the time of the month A@@ bi@@ b : for in the month A@@ bi@@ b th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st out from Egypt .
but the fir@@ st@@ ling of an ass th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ de@@ em with a lam@@ b : and if th@@ ou re@@ de@@ em him not , then s@@ halt th@@ ou break his nec@@ k . all the fir@@ st@@ born of TH@@ Y sons th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ de@@ em . and none shall appear before me empty .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe the feast of weeks , of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of wheat har@@ v@@ est , and the feast of ing@@ a@@ ther@@ ing at the year 's end .
for I will cast out the nations before the@@ e , and en@@ large TH@@ Y borders : neither shall any man desire TH@@ Y land , when th@@ ou s@@ halt go up to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God th@@ ri@@ ce in the year .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with le@@ av@@ en ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the pass@@ over be left un@@ to the morning .
the first of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of TH@@ Y land th@@ ou s@@ halt bring un@@ to the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God . T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not se@@ e@@ the a k@@ id in his mother 's milk .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es came down from mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tables of testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Mos@@ es w@@ ist not that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one while he talked with him .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come n@@ igh him .
and after@@ ward all the children of Israel came n@@ igh : and he gave them in comman@@ d@@ ment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount S@@ ina@@ i .
but when Mos@@ es went in before the Lord to speak with him , he took the v@@ ail off , until he came out . and he came out , and sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel that which he was comman@@ ded .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Mos@@ es , that the s@@ kin of Mos@@ es ' face sh@@ one : and Mos@@ es put the v@@ ail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Mos@@ es gathered all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel together , and said un@@ to them , These are the words which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , that ye should do them .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an hol@@ y day , a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath of rest to the Lord : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth work there@@ in shall be put to death .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord comman@@ ded , saying ,
and the incen@@ se alt@@ ar , and his st@@ aves , and the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and the swe@@ et incen@@ se , and the han@@ ging for the door at the entering in of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,
the clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the hol@@ y place , the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office .
and they came , every one whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord 's offering to the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for all his service , and for the hol@@ y gar@@ ments .
and every man , with whom was found blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine lin@@ en , and go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir , and red sk@@ ins of r@@ ams , and bad@@ gers ' sk@@ ins , brought them .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and br@@ ass brought the Lord 's offering : and every man , with whom was found sh@@ it@@ tim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hear@@ ted did sp@@ in with their hands , and brought that which they had sp@@ un , both of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine lin@@ en .
and the rul@@ ers brought ony@@ x stones , and stones to be set , for the ep@@ ho@@ d , and for the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te ;
the children of Israel brought a willing offering un@@ to the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had comman@@ ded to be made by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and he hat@@ h filled him with the spirit of God , in wis@@ dom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of work@@ manship ;
and in the cutting of stones , to set them , and in car@@ ving of wood , to make any manner of c@@ un@@ ning work .
and he hat@@ h put in his heart that he may te@@ ach , both he , and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan .
and Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise hear@@ ted man , in whose heart the Lord had put wis@@ dom , even every one whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come un@@ to the work to do it :
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the Lord comman@@ ded to make .
and every wise hear@@ ted man among them that w@@ rought the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle made ten cur@@ tains of fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en , and blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let : with ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms of c@@ un@@ ning work made he them .
the length of one cur@@ tain was twenty and eight cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th of one cur@@ tain four cu@@ bi@@ ts : the cur@@ tains were all of one size .
and he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling : likewise he made in the ut@@ ter@@ most side of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .
fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in one cur@@ tain , and fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in the edge of the cur@@ tain which was in the cou@@ pling of the second : the lo@@ ops held one cur@@ tain to another .

and for@@ ty so@@ c@@ kets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two so@@ c@@ kets under one board for his two ten@@ ons , and two so@@ c@@ kets under another board for his two ten@@ ons .
and he over@@ laid the boards with gold , and made their r@@ ings of gold to be places for the bars , and over@@ laid the bars with gold .

and the silver of them that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the Con@@ gre@@ gation was an hundred tal@@ ents , and a thousand seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and fif@@ teen sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
and of the thousand seven hundred sev@@ enty and five sh@@ ek@@ els he made ho@@ oks for the pil@@ lars , and over@@ laid their chap@@ it@@ ers , and fil@@ le@@ ted them .
and of the blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , they made clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the hol@@ y place , and made the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and they did beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , and in the pur@@ ple , and in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , with c@@ un@@ ning work .
they made sho@@ ul@@ der@@ pieces for it , to couple it together : by the two ed@@ ges was it coup@@ led together .
and the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of his ep@@ ho@@ d , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work there@@ of ; of gold , blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and they w@@ rought ony@@ x stones inc@@ los@@ ed in ou@@ ches of gold , Gra@@ ven , as sign@@ ets are Gra@@ ven , with the names of the children of Israel .
and he put them on the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the ep@@ ho@@ d , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he made the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of c@@ un@@ ning work , like the work of the ep@@ ho@@ d ; of gold , blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en .
and they set in it four ro@@ ws of stones : the first row was a sar@@ di@@ us , a top@@ az , and a car@@ bun@@ cle : this was the first row .
and the fourth row , a ber@@ y@@ l , an ony@@ x , and a j@@ as@@ per : they were inc@@ los@@ ed in ou@@ ches of gold in their inc@@ los@@ ings .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , every one with his name , according to the twelve tri@@ bes .
and the two ends of the two w@@ re@@ a@@ then cha@@ ins they fas@@ tened in the two ou@@ ches , and put them on the sho@@ ul@@ der@@ pieces of the ep@@ ho@@ d , before it .
and they made two r@@ ings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d in@@ ward .
and they made two other golden r@@ ings , and put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part of it , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and they did bin@@ d the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te by his r@@ ings un@@ to the r@@ ings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a la@@ ce of blue , that it might be above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te might not be lo@@ os@@ ed from the ep@@ ho@@ d ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and there was an hol@@ e in the mid@@ st of the ro@@ be , as the hol@@ e of an haber@@ ge@@ on , with a band round about the hol@@ e , that it should not ren@@ d .
and they made the pla@@ te of the hol@@ y cro@@ wn of p@@ ure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , H@@ OL@@ IN@@ ESS TO the Lord .
thus was all the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation finished : and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so did they .
and Mos@@ es did look upon all the work , and , be@@ hold , they have done it as the Lord had comman@@ ded , even so had they done it : and Mos@@ es b@@ les@@ sed them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put there@@ in the Ar@@ k of the testimony , and cover the Ar@@ k with the v@@ ail .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the cand@@ le@@ stick , and light the lam@@ ps there@@ of .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set the alt@@ ar of gold for the incen@@ se before the Ar@@ k of the testimony , and put the han@@ ging of the door to the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering before the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .

and th@@ ou s@@ halt take the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and ano@@ int the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and all that is there@@ in , and s@@ halt hal@@ low it , and all the vessels there@@ of : and it shall be hol@@ y .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ano@@ int the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and all his vessels , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy the alt@@ ar : and it shall be an alt@@ ar most hol@@ y .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring Aaron and his sons un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and was@@ h them with water .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put upon Aaron the hol@@ y gar@@ ments , and ano@@ int him , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy him ; that he may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ano@@ int them , as th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st ano@@ int their father , that they may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office : for their ano@@ in@@ ting shall su@@ rely be an ever@@ lasting pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od throughout their generations .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up .
and Mos@@ es re@@ ar@@ ed up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and fas@@ tened his so@@ c@@ kets , and set up the boards there@@ of , and put in the bars there@@ of , and re@@ ar@@ ed up his pil@@ lars .
and he spread abroad the tent over the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he took and put the testimony into the Ar@@ k , and set the st@@ aves on the Ar@@ k , and put the mer@@ cy seat above upon the Ar@@ k :
and he brought the Ar@@ k into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and set up the v@@ ail of the covering , and covered the Ar@@ k of the testimony ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .

and ye shall not go out of the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation in seven days , until the days of your consec@@ ration be at an end : for seven days shall he consec@@ rate you .
as he hat@@ h done this day , so the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded to do , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for you .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that Mos@@ es called Aaron and his sons , and the el@@ ders of Israel ;
and un@@ to the children of Israel th@@ ou s@@ halt speak , saying , T@@ ake ye a k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering ; and a cal@@ f and a lam@@ b , both of the first year , without ble@@ mis@@ h , for a bur@@ n@@ t offering ;
and they brought that which Mos@@ es comman@@ ded before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation drew near and stood before the Lord .
and the sons of Aaron brought the blood un@@ to him : and he di@@ pped his fin@@ ger in the blood , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar , and p@@ oured out the blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar :
but the f@@ at , and the kid@@ neys , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver of the sin offering , he bur@@ n@@ t upon the alt@@ ar ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and they presented the bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to him , with the pieces there@@ of , and the head : and he bur@@ n@@ t them upon the alt@@ ar .
and he brought the people 's offering , and took the go@@ at , which was the sin offering for the people , and sle@@ w it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
he sle@@ w also the bul@@ lock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented un@@ to him the blood , which he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon the alt@@ ar round about ,
and the f@@ at of the bul@@ lock and of the ram , the rum@@ p , and that which cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the kid@@ neys , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver :
and Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and b@@ les@@ sed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and peace offer@@ ings .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and came out , and b@@ les@@ sed the people : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to all the people .
and there came a fire out from before the Lord , and consu@@ med upon the alt@@ ar the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the f@@ at : which when all the people saw , they sh@@ ou@@ ted , and fell on their faces .
and Nad@@ a@@ b and A@@ bi@@ hu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his cen@@ ser , and put fire there@@ in , and put incen@@ se there@@ on , and offered st@@ range fire before the Lord , which he comman@@ ded them not .
then Mos@@ es said un@@ to Aaron , This is it that the Lord sp@@ ake , saying , I will be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them that come n@@ igh me , and before all the people I will be gl@@ ori@@ fied . and Aaron held his peace .
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , lest ye die : for the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of the Lord is upon you . and they did according to the word of Mos@@ es .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , th@@ ou , nor TH@@ Y sons with the@@ e , when ye go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and that ye may te@@ ach the children of Israel all the stat@@ utes which the Lord hat@@ h spoken un@@ to them by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to Ele@@ azar and un@@ to I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , his sons that were left , T@@ ake the meat offering that remain@@ eth of the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , and eat it without le@@ av@@ en bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar : for it is most hol@@ y :
and ye shall eat it in the hol@@ y place , because it is TH@@ Y due , and TH@@ Y sons ' due , of the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of the Lord made by fire : for so I am comman@@ ded .
be@@ hold , the blood of it was not brought in within the hol@@ y place : ye should indeed have e@@ aten it in the hol@@ y place , as I comman@@ ded .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , These are the be@@ asts which ye shall eat among all the be@@ asts that are on the ear@@ th .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever par@@ te@@ th the ho@@ of , and is cl@@ ov@@ en@@ fo@@ oted , and che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , among the be@@ asts , that shall ye eat .

and the sw@@ ine , though he divide the ho@@ of , and be cl@@ ov@@ en@@ fo@@ oted , yet he che@@ w@@ eth not the cu@@ d ; he is un@@ clean to you .
these shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h fin@@ s and scal@@ es in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
and all that have not fin@@ s and scal@@ es in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you :
they shall be even an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you ; ye shall not eat of their f@@ les@@ h , but ye shall have their car@@ cases in ab@@ omin@@ ation .
and these are they which ye shall have in ab@@ omin@@ ation among the fo@@ w@@ ls ; they shall not be e@@ aten , they are an ab@@ omin@@ ation : the e@@ ag@@ le , and the os@@ si@@ fra@@ ge , and the os@@ pra@@ y ,
yet these may ye eat of every flying cre@@ eping thing that go@@ eth upon all four , which have leg@@ s above their feet , to le@@ ap with@@ al upon the ear@@ th ;

wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon the bel@@ ly , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon all four , or wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h more feet among all cre@@ eping things that cre@@ ep upon the ear@@ th , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
Y@@ e shall not make yo@@ ur@@ selves ab@@ omin@@ able with any cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth , neither shall ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ clean with them , that ye should be def@@ iled there@@ by .
for I am the Lord your God : ye shall therefore sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , and ye shall be hol@@ y ; for I am hol@@ y : neither shall ye def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with any manner of cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .

and every thing that she li@@ eth upon in her separation shall be un@@ clean : every thing also that she sit@@ te@@ th upon shall be un@@ clean .
and if it be on her bed , or on any thing where@@ on she sit@@ te@@ th , when he tou@@ ch@@ eth it , he shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be un@@ clean seven days ; and all the bed where@@ on he li@@ eth shall be un@@ clean .
every bed where@@ on she li@@ eth all the days of her issue shall be un@@ to her as the bed of her separation : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she sit@@ te@@ th upon shall be un@@ clean , as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of her separation .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth those things shall be un@@ clean , and shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and on the eighth day she shall take un@@ to her two tur@@ t@@ les , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , and bring them un@@ to the pri@@ est , to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the pri@@ est shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering ; and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for her before the Lord for the issue of her un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
he shall put on the hol@@ y lin@@ en co@@ at , and he shall have the lin@@ en bre@@ eches upon his f@@ les@@ h , and shall be gir@@ ded with a lin@@ en gir@@ dle , and with the lin@@ en Mit@@ re shall he be at@@ ti@@ red : these are hol@@ y gar@@ ments ; therefore shall he was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h in water , and so put them on .
and he shall take the two go@@ ats , and present them before the Lord at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two go@@ ats ; one lot for the Lord , and the other lot for the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at .
and Aaron shall bring the go@@ at upon which the Lord 's lot fell , and offer him for a sin offering .
but the go@@ at , on which the lot fell to be the s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement with him , and to let him go for a s@@ cap@@ e@@ go@@ at into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Aaron shall bring the bul@@ lock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bul@@ lock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a cen@@ ser full of burning co@@ als of fire from off the alt@@ ar before the Lord , and his hands full of swe@@ et incen@@ se beaten small , and bring it within the v@@ ail :
and he shall put the incen@@ se upon the fire before the Lord , that the cl@@ oud of the incen@@ se may cover the mer@@ cy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :

and he shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the hol@@ y place , because of the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of the children of Israel , and because of their trans@@ gres@@ sions in all their sin@@ s : and so shall he do for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that remain@@ eth among them in the mid@@ st of their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess .
and there shall be no man in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation when he go@@ eth in to make an At@@ on@@ ement in the hol@@ y place , until he come out , and have made an At@@ on@@ ement for himself , and for his household , and for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
and he shall go out un@@ to the alt@@ ar that is before the Lord , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for it ; and shall take of the blood of the bul@@ lock , and of the blood of the go@@ at , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar round about .
and he shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the blood upon it with his fin@@ ger seven times , and cleans@@ e it , and hal@@ low it from the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of the children of Israel .
and when he hat@@ h made an end of reconc@@ iling the hol@@ y place , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and the alt@@ ar , he shall bring the live go@@ at :
and the go@@ at shall bear upon him all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities un@@ to a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the go@@ at in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Aaron shall come into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall put off the lin@@ en gar@@ ments , which he put on when he went into the hol@@ y place , and shall leave them there :

and the bul@@ lock for the sin offering , and the go@@ at for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make At@@ on@@ ement in the hol@@ y place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall bur@@ n in the fire their sk@@ ins , and their f@@ les@@ h , and their D@@ ung .
and he that bur@@ net@@ h them shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp .
and this shall be a statute for ever un@@ to you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall aff@@ lic@@ t your so@@ ul@@ s , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among you :
for on that day shall the pri@@ est make an At@@ on@@ ement for you , to cleans@@ e you , that ye may be clean from all your sin@@ s before the Lord .
and the pri@@ est , whom he shall ano@@ int , and whom he shall consec@@ rate to minister in the pri@@ est 's office in his father 's stead , shall make the At@@ on@@ ement , and shall put on the lin@@ en clo@@ th@@ es , even the hol@@ y gar@@ ments :

speak un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to his sons , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them ; This is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying ,
what man so@@ ever there be of the house of Israel , that kil@@ le@@ th an o@@ x , or lam@@ b , or go@@ at , in the camp , or that kil@@ le@@ th it out of the camp ,
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer an offering un@@ to the Lord before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; blood shall be imp@@ uted un@@ to that man ; he hat@@ h shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :

and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers which so@@ jour@@ n among you , that offer@@ eth a bur@@ n@@ t offering of sacrifice ,
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer it un@@ to the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n among you , that e@@ ate@@ th any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that sou@@ l that e@@ ate@@ th blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
for the life of the f@@ les@@ h is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the alt@@ ar to make an At@@ on@@ ement for your so@@ ul@@ s : for it is the blood that mak@@ eth an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n among you , which hun@@ te@@ th and cat@@ ch@@ eth any be@@ ast or fo@@ w@@ l that may be e@@ aten ; he shall even p@@ our out the blood there@@ of , and cover it with d@@ ust .

Y@@ e shall therefore keep my stat@@ utes , and my judg@@ ments : which if a man do , he shall live in them : I am the Lord .
the nak@@ edn@@ ess of TH@@ Y father , or the nak@@ edn@@ ess of TH@@ Y mother , s@@ halt th@@ ou not un@@ cover : she is TH@@ Y mother ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess .

T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not un@@ cover the nak@@ edn@@ ess of a woman and her daughter , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; for they are her near k@@ ins@@ women : it is w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
neither s@@ halt th@@ ou take a wife to her sister , to ve@@ x her , to un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess , bes@@ ide the other in her life time .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not let any of TH@@ Y se@@ ed pass through the fire to Mo@@ le@@ ch , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou prof@@ ane the name of TH@@ Y God : I am the Lord .
Y@@ e shall therefore keep my stat@@ utes and my judg@@ ments , and shall not commit any of these ab@@ omin@@ ations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among you :
( for all these ab@@ omin@@ ations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is def@@ iled ; )
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall commit any of these ab@@ omin@@ ations , even the so@@ ul@@ s that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordin@@ ance , that ye commit not any one of these ab@@ omin@@ able customs , which were committed before you , and that ye def@@ ile not yo@@ ur@@ selves there@@ in : I am the Lord your God .
speak un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Y@@ e shall be hol@@ y : for I the Lord your God am hol@@ y .
and if it be e@@ aten at all on the third day , it is ab@@ omin@@ able ; it shall not be accepted .
therefore every one that e@@ ate@@ th it shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because he hat@@ h prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ low@@ ed thing of the Lord : and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not wh@@ ol@@ ly re@@ ap the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather the g@@ le@@ an@@ ings of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not g@@ le@@ an TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather every gra@@ pe of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard ; th@@ ou s@@ halt leave them for the poor and st@@ ran@@ ger : I am the Lord your God .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not def@@ ra@@ ud TH@@ Y neighbour , neither ro@@ b him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with the@@ e all night until the morning .

T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not go up and down as a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er among TH@@ Y people : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou stand against the blood of TH@@ Y neighbour : I am the Lord .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not av@@ en@@ ge , nor bear any gru@@ dge against the children of TH@@ Y people , but th@@ ou s@@ halt love TH@@ Y neighbour as th@@ y@@ self : I am the Lord .
Y@@ e shall keep my stat@@ utes . T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not let TH@@ Y c@@ attle gender with a di@@ verse kind : th@@ ou s@@ halt not so@@ w TH@@ Y field with min@@ g@@ led se@@ ed : neither shall a gar@@ ment min@@ g@@ led of lin@@ en and wo@@ ol@@ len come upon the@@ e .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever li@@ eth car@@ n@@ ally with a woman , that is a bon@@ d@@ ma@@ id , bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed to an husband , and not at all re@@ deemed , nor freedom given her ; she shall be s@@ cour@@ ged ; they shall not be put to death , because she was not free .
and he shall bring his t@@ res@@ pass offering un@@ to the Lord , un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , even a ram for a t@@ res@@ pass offering .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him with the ram of the t@@ res@@ pass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hat@@ h done : and the sin which he hat@@ h done shall be for@@ given him .
and when ye shall come into the land , and shall have plan@@ ted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit there@@ of as un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised : three years shall it be as un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised un@@ to you : it shall not be e@@ aten of .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit there@@ of , that it may yield un@@ to you the increase there@@ of : I am the Lord your God .
Y@@ e shall not make any cut@@ t@@ ings in your f@@ les@@ h for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the Lord .
do not pro@@ stitute TH@@ Y daughter , to cause her to be a wh@@ ore ; lest the land fall to wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the land become full of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
but the st@@ ran@@ ger that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th with you shall be un@@ to you as one born among you , and th@@ ou s@@ halt love him as th@@ y@@ self ; for ye were st@@ ran@@ gers in the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
just balan@@ ces , just we@@ ights , a just ep@@ ha@@ h , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
again , th@@ ou s@@ halt say to the children of Israel , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be of the children of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n in Israel , that gi@@ vet@@ h any of his se@@ ed un@@ to Mo@@ le@@ ch ; he shall su@@ rely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
and I will set my face against that man , and will cut him off from among his people ; because he hat@@ h given of his se@@ ed un@@ to Mo@@ le@@ ch , to def@@ ile my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he gi@@ vet@@ h of his se@@ ed un@@ to Mo@@ le@@ ch , and kill him not :
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a wh@@ oring after him , to commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with Mo@@ le@@ ch , from among their people .
and the sou@@ l that tur@@ net@@ h after such as have familiar spir@@ its , and after w@@ iz@@ ards , to go a wh@@ oring after them , I will even set my face against that sou@@ l , and will cut him off from among his people .
and the man that li@@ eth with his father 's wife hat@@ h uncovered his father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess : both of them shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall su@@ rely be put to death : they have w@@ rought conf@@ usion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with man@@ kind , as he li@@ eth with a woman , both of them have committed an ab@@ omin@@ ation : they shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with a be@@ ast , he shall su@@ rely be put to death : and ye shall s@@ lay the be@@ ast .
and if a woman approach un@@ to any be@@ ast , and lie down there@@ to , th@@ ou s@@ halt kill the woman , and the be@@ ast : they shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her si@@ ck@@ ness , and shall un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; he hat@@ h discovered her fo@@ un@@ tain , and she hat@@ h uncovered the fo@@ un@@ tain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not un@@ cover the nak@@ edn@@ ess of TH@@ Y mother 's sister , nor of TH@@ Y father 's sister : for he un@@ cover@@ eth his near kin : they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an un@@ clean thing : he hat@@ h uncovered his brother 's nak@@ edn@@ ess ; they shall be ch@@ ild@@ less .
and ye shall not walk in the man@@ ners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I ab@@ hor@@ red them .
but I have said un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall inher@@ it their land , and I will give it un@@ to you to poss@@ ess it , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey : I am the Lord your God , which have separated you from other people .
Y@@ e shall therefore put difference between clean be@@ asts and un@@ clean , and between un@@ clean fo@@ w@@ ls and clean : and ye shall not make your so@@ ul@@ s ab@@ omin@@ able by be@@ ast , or by fo@@ w@@ l , or by any manner of living thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth on the ground , which I have separated from you as un@@ clean .
and for his sister a vir@@ gin , that is n@@ igh un@@ to him , which hat@@ h had no husband ; for her may he be def@@ iled .
they shall not make bal@@ d@@ ness upon their head , neither shall they s@@ have off the cor@@ ner of their be@@ ard , nor make any cut@@ t@@ ings in their f@@ les@@ h .
they shall be hol@@ y un@@ to their God , and not prof@@ ane the name of their God : for the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be hol@@ y .
they shall not take a wife that is a wh@@ ore , or prof@@ ane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is hol@@ y un@@ to his God .
and he that is the high pri@@ est among his bre@@ th@@ ren , upon whose head the ano@@ in@@ ting oil was p@@ oured , and that is consec@@ rated to put on the gar@@ ments , shall not un@@ cover his head , nor ren@@ d his clo@@ th@@ es ;
neither shall he go out of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , nor prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of his God ; for the cro@@ wn of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
a wi@@ dow , or a div@@ or@@ ced woman , or prof@@ ane , or an har@@ lot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a vir@@ gin of his own people to wife .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man he be that hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h , he shall not approach : a b@@ lin@@ d man , or a la@@ me , or he that hat@@ h a flat n@@ ose , or any thing super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous ,
or cro@@ ok@@ back@@ t , or a d@@ war@@ f , or that hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h in his eye , or be s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , or sc@@ ab@@ bed , or hat@@ h his stones broken ;
only he shall not go in un@@ to the v@@ ail , nor come n@@ igh un@@ to the alt@@ ar , because he hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h ; that he prof@@ ane not my sanc@@ tu@@ aries : for I the Lord do sanc@@ ti@@ fy them .
speak un@@ to Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , and that they prof@@ ane not my hol@@ y name in those things which they hal@@ low un@@ to me : I am the Lord .
say un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be of all your se@@ ed among your generations , that go@@ eth un@@ to the hol@@ y things , which the children of Israel hal@@ low un@@ to the Lord , having his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess upon him , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from my presence : I am the Lord .
or wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth any cre@@ eping thing , where@@ by he may be made un@@ clean , or a man of whom he may take un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess he hat@@ h ;
the sou@@ l which hat@@ h touched any such shall be un@@ clean until even , and shall not eat of the hol@@ y things , unless he was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h with water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall after@@ ward eat of the hol@@ y things ; because it is his food .
there shall no st@@ ran@@ ger eat of the hol@@ y thing : a so@@ jour@@ ner of the pri@@ est , or an hired ser@@ vant , shall not eat of the hol@@ y thing .
but if the pri@@ est buy any sou@@ l with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the pri@@ est 's daughter also be married un@@ to a st@@ ran@@ ger , she may not eat of an offering of the hol@@ y things .
and if a man eat of the hol@@ y thing un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , then he shall put the fifth part there@@ of un@@ to it , and shall give it un@@ to the pri@@ est with the hol@@ y thing .
and they shall not prof@@ ane the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , which they offer un@@ to the Lord ;
but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
b@@ lin@@ d , or broken , or ma@@ imed , or having a W@@ en , or s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , or sc@@ ab@@ bed , ye shall not offer these un@@ to the Lord , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord .
Y@@ e shall not offer un@@ to the Lord that which is bru@@ ised , or cr@@ us@@ hed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering there@@ of in your land .
neither from a st@@ ran@@ ger 's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and ble@@ mis@@ hes be in them : they shall not be accepted for you .
on the same day it shall be e@@ aten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the mor@@ row : I am the Lord .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , concerning the fe@@ asts of the Lord , which ye shall procla@@ im to be hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ations , even these are my fe@@ asts .
and on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the same month is the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread un@@ to the Lord : seven days ye must eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord seven days : in the seventh day is an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye be come into the land which I give un@@ to you , and shall re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est there@@ of , then ye shall bring a she@@ af of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of your har@@ v@@ est un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and he shall wave the she@@ af before the Lord , to be accepted for you : on the mor@@ row after the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath the pri@@ est shall wave it .
and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the she@@ af an he lam@@ b without ble@@ mis@@ h of the first year for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor par@@ ched cor@@ n , nor green e@@ ars , until the sel@@ f@@ same day that ye have brought an offering un@@ to your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your d@@ wel@@ lings .
and ye shall count un@@ to you from the mor@@ row after the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , from the day that ye brought the she@@ af of the wave offering ; seven sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths shall be complete :
and ye shall offer with the bread seven lam@@ bs without ble@@ mis@@ h of the first year , and one young bul@@ lock , and two r@@ ams : they shall be for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord , with their meat offering , and their drink offer@@ ings , even an offering made by fire , of swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
then ye shall sacrifice one k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering , and two lam@@ bs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings .
and the pri@@ est shall wave them with the bread of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its for a wave offering before the Lord , with the two lam@@ bs : they shall be hol@@ y to the Lord for the pri@@ est .
and ye shall procla@@ im on the sel@@ f@@ same day , that it may be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in : it shall be a statute for ever in all your d@@ wel@@ lings throughout your generations .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not make clean rid@@ dance of the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field when th@@ ou re@@ ap@@ est , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather any g@@ le@@ an@@ ing of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est : th@@ ou s@@ halt leave them un@@ to the poor , and to the st@@ ran@@ ger : I am the Lord your God .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , In the seventh month , in the first day of the month , shall ye have a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , a memorial of b@@ low@@ ing of tr@@ ump@@ ets , an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation .
also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of At@@ on@@ ement : it shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you ; and ye shall aff@@ lic@@ t your so@@ ul@@ s , and offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of At@@ on@@ ement , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for you before the Lord your God .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sou@@ l it be that shall not be aff@@ lic@@ ted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sou@@ l it be that do@@ eth any work in that same day , the same sou@@ l will I destroy from among his people .
it shall be un@@ to you a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath of rest , and ye shall aff@@ lic@@ t your so@@ ul@@ s : in the ninth day of the month at even , from even un@@ to even , shall ye celebrate your sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : on the eighth day shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : it is a so@@ lem@@ n assembly ; and ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in .

this is the service of the families of the sons of Mer@@ ari , according to all their service , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .
and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty .
these were they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , which Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fa@@ thers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , whom Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .

even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , were eight thousand and five hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score .
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they def@@ ile not their camps , in the mid@@ st where@@ of I d@@ well .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall conf@@ ess their sin which they have done : and he shall re@@ compen@@ se his t@@ res@@ pass with the principal there@@ of , and add un@@ to it the fifth part there@@ of , and give it un@@ to him against whom he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed .
and every offering of all the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , which they bring un@@ to the pri@@ est , shall be his .
and a man lie with her car@@ n@@ ally , and it be hi@@ d from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be def@@ iled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
and the spirit of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y come upon him , and he be Je@@ al@@ ous of his wife , and she be def@@ iled : or if the spirit of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y come upon him , and he be Je@@ al@@ ous of his wife , and she be not def@@ iled :
and the pri@@ est shall take hol@@ y water in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel ; and of the d@@ ust that is in the floor of the tab@@ ern@@ acle the pri@@ est shall take , and put it into the water :
and the pri@@ est shall set the woman before the Lord , and un@@ cover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y offering : and the pri@@ est shall have in his hand the bitter water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se :
but if th@@ ou h@@ ast gone aside to another instead of TH@@ Y husband , and if th@@ ou be def@@ iled , and some man have la@@ in with the@@ e bes@@ ide th@@ ine husband :

and this water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se shall go into TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , to make TH@@ Y bel@@ ly to s@@ well , and TH@@ Y th@@ igh to ro@@ t : and the woman shall say , A@@ men , amen .
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se : and the water that ca@@ us@@ eth the cur@@ se shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the pri@@ est shall take the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the alt@@ ar :
and the pri@@ est shall take an hand@@ ful of the offering , even the memorial there@@ of , and bur@@ n it upon the alt@@ ar , and after@@ ward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not def@@ iled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conce@@ ive se@@ ed .
or when the spirit of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y co@@ me@@ th upon him , and he be Je@@ al@@ ous over his wife , and shall set the woman before the Lord , and the pri@@ est shall exec@@ ute upon her all this law .
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink , and shall drink no vin@@ eg@@ ar of wine , or vin@@ eg@@ ar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liqu@@ or of grap@@ es , nor eat mo@@ ist grap@@ es , or dri@@ ed .
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the v@@ ine tree , from the ker@@ n@@ els even to the hus@@ k .
all the days of the vo@@ w of his separation there shall no ras@@ or come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separ@@ ate@@ th himself un@@ to the Lord , he shall be hol@@ y , and shall let the loc@@ ks of the ha@@ ir of his head grow .
he shall not make himself un@@ clean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consec@@ ration of his God is upon his head .
and if any man die very su@@ d@@ den@@ ly by him , and he hat@@ h def@@ iled the head of his consec@@ ration ; then he shall s@@ have his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he s@@ have it .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two tur@@ t@@ les , or two young pi@@ ge@@ ons , to the pri@@ est , to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and the pri@@ est shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for him , for that he sin@@ ned by the dead , and shall hal@@ low his head that same day .
and he shall consec@@ rate un@@ to the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lam@@ b of the first year for a t@@ res@@ pass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was def@@ iled .
and this is the law of the N@@ azar@@ ite , when the days of his separation are fulfilled : he shall be brought un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :

and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , with the bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : the pri@@ est shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the N@@ azar@@ ite shall s@@ have the head of his separation at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall take the ha@@ ir of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings .
and it came to pass on the day that Mos@@ es had fully set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and had ano@@ in@@ ted it , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and all the instruments there@@ of , both the alt@@ ar and all the vessels there@@ of , and had ano@@ in@@ ted them , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied them ;
and four w@@ ag@@ ons and eight ox@@ en he gave un@@ to the sons of Mer@@ ari , according un@@ to their service , under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .
but un@@ to the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h he gave none : because the service of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary belonging un@@ to them was that they should bear upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
and the pr@@ inces offered for dedic@@ ating of the alt@@ ar in the day that it was ano@@ in@@ ted , even the pr@@ inces offered their offering before the alt@@ ar .
and he that offered his offering the first day was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h :

this was the dedic@@ ation of the alt@@ ar , in the day when it was ano@@ in@@ ted , by the pr@@ inces of Israel : twelve char@@ gers of silver , twelve silver bo@@ w@@ ls , twelve sp@@ o@@ ons of gold :
the golden sp@@ o@@ ons were twelve , full of incen@@ se , weigh@@ ing ten sh@@ ek@@ els ap@@ i@@ ece , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : all the gold of the sp@@ o@@ ons was an hundred and twenty sh@@ ek@@ els .
and all the ox@@ en for the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings were twenty and four bul@@ loc@@ ks , the r@@ ams six@@ ty , the he go@@ ats six@@ ty , the lam@@ bs of the first year six@@ ty . this was the dedic@@ ation of the alt@@ ar , after that it was ano@@ in@@ ted .
and this work of the cand@@ le@@ stick was of beaten gold , un@@ to the S@@ haf@@ t there@@ of , un@@ to the flowers there@@ of , was beaten work : according un@@ to the pat@@ tern which the Lord had she@@ wed Mos@@ es , so he made the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to them , to cleans@@ e them : sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le water of pur@@ ifying upon them , and let them s@@ have all their f@@ les@@ h , and let them was@@ h their clo@@ th@@ es , and so make themselves clean .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring the L@@ evi@@ tes before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and th@@ ou s@@ halt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring the L@@ evi@@ tes before the Lord : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the L@@ evi@@ tes :
and Aaron shall offer the L@@ evi@@ tes before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may exec@@ ute the service of the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bul@@ loc@@ ks : and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , un@@ to the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for the L@@ evi@@ tes .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set the L@@ evi@@ tes before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering un@@ to the Lord .
and after that shall the L@@ evi@@ tes go in to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and th@@ ou s@@ halt cleans@@ e them , and offer them for an offering .
for they are wh@@ ol@@ ly given un@@ to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every w@@ om@@ b , even instead of the fir@@ st@@ born of all the children of Israel , have I taken them un@@ to me .
for all the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel are mine , both man and be@@ ast : on the day that I smo@@ te every fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt I sanc@@ ti@@ fied them for myself .
and Mos@@ es , and Aaron , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , did to the L@@ evi@@ tes according un@@ to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so did the children of Israel un@@ to them .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes were pur@@ ified , and they was@@ hed their clo@@ th@@ es ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord ; and Aaron made an At@@ on@@ ement for them to cleans@@ e them .
and after that went the L@@ evi@@ tes in to do their service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the Lord had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so did they un@@ to them .
this is it that belon@@ get@@ h un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes : from twenty and five years old and up@@ ward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
but shall minister with their bre@@ th@@ ren in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes tou@@ ching their charge .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the ri@@ tes of it , and according to all the ceremon@@ ies there@@ of , shall ye keep it .
and they kept the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the first month at even in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i : according to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so did the children of Israel .
and there were certain men , who were def@@ iled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the pass@@ over on that day : and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said un@@ to him , We are def@@ iled by the dead body of a man : where@@ fore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
they shall leave none of it un@@ to the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the pass@@ over they shall keep it .
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and for@@ be@@ aret@@ h to keep the pass@@ over , even the same sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , name@@ ly , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cl@@ oud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cl@@ oud abo@@ de , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their ten@@ ts .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they pit@@ ched : as long as the cl@@ oud abo@@ de upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle they rested in their ten@@ ts .
and when the cl@@ oud tar@@ ried long upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not .
and so it was , when the cl@@ oud was a few days upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they abo@@ de in their ten@@ ts , and according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cl@@ oud tar@@ ried upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle , remaining there@@ on , the children of Israel abo@@ de in their ten@@ ts , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not : but when it was taken up , they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they rested in the ten@@ ts , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
make the@@ e two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver ; of a whole piece s@@ halt th@@ ou make them : that th@@ ou may@@ est use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
and if they blow but with one tr@@ ump@@ et , then the pr@@ inces , which are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves un@@ to the@@ e .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their jour@@ neys .
but when the Con@@ gre@@ gation is to be gathered together , ye shall blow , but ye shall not sound an alarm .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and ye shall be remember@@ ed before the Lord your God , and ye shall be sav@@ ed from your enem@@ ies .
and it came to pass on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
and the children of Israel took their jour@@ neys out of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i ; and the cl@@ oud rested in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their armies : and over his host was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har was N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el the son of Zu@@ ar .
and the tab@@ ern@@ acle was taken down ; and the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on and the sons of Mer@@ ari set forward , bearing the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the standard of the camp of Re@@ ub@@ en set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Eli@@ z@@ ur the son of S@@ hede@@ ur .
and the standard of the camp of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im set forward according to their armies : and over his host was E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was G@@ am@@ ali@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ah@@ z@@ ur .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i .
and over the host of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her was P@@ ag@@ i@@ el the son of O@@ cr@@ an .
thus were the jour@@ ne@@ y@@ ings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and it shall be , if th@@ ou go with us , ye@@ a , it shall be , that what Go@@ od@@ ness the Lord shall do un@@ to us , the same will we do un@@ to the@@ e .
and they depar@@ ted from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and it came to pass , when the Ar@@ k set forward , that Mos@@ es said , R@@ ise up , Lord , and let th@@ ine enem@@ ies be sc@@ at@@ tered ; and let them that h@@ ate the@@ e flee before the@@ e .
and when the people complained , it disp@@ le@@ ased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led ; and the fire of the Lord bur@@ n@@ t among them , and consu@@ med them that were in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the camp .
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , and the mel@@ ons , and the le@@ eks , and the on@@ ions , and the gar@@ lick :
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mil@@ ls , or beat it in a mort@@ ar , and bak@@ ed it in p@@ ans , and made cak@@ es of it : and the tas@@ te of it was as the tas@@ te of fresh oil .
then Mos@@ es heard the people we@@ ep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led greatly ; Mos@@ es also was disp@@ le@@ ased .
and if th@@ ou deal thus with me , kill me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of hand , if I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight ; and let me not see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edn@@ ess .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ ather un@@ to me sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of Israel , whom th@@ ou know@@ est to be the el@@ ders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that they may stand there with the@@ e .
and I will come down and talk with the@@ e there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon the@@ e , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with the@@ e , that th@@ ou bear it not th@@ y@@ self alone .
but even a whole month , until it come out at your nos@@ tr@@ ils , and it be lo@@ ath@@ some un@@ to you : because that ye have desp@@ ised the Lord which is among you , and have we@@ pt before him , saying , Wh@@ y came we forth out of Egypt ?
shall the f@@ loc@@ ks and the her@@ ds be sla@@ in for them , to su@@ ffic@@ e them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to su@@ ffic@@ e them ?
and Mos@@ es went out , and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of the people , and set them round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the Lord came down in a cl@@ oud , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it un@@ to the sev@@ enty el@@ ders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , and did not ce@@ ase .
and there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day 's journey on this side , and as it were a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cu@@ bi@@ ts high upon the face of the ear@@ th .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the qu@@ ails : he that gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , ER@@ E it was che@@ wed , the wr@@ ath of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and the Lord smo@@ te the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am and Aaron sp@@ ake against Mos@@ es because of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian woman .
( now the man Mos@@ es was very me@@ ek , above all the men which were upon the face of the ear@@ th . )
and the Lord sp@@ ake su@@ d@@ den@@ ly un@@ to Mos@@ es , and un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to Mi@@ ri@@ am , C@@ ome out ye three un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation . and they three came out .
and the Lord came down in the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am : and they both came forth .
and he said , He@@ ar now my words : if there be a pro@@ phe@@ t among you , I the Lord will make myself known un@@ to him in a vision , and will speak un@@ to him in a dream .
with him will I speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even apparently , and not in dark spe@@ eches ; and the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of the Lord shall he be@@ hold : where@@ fore then were ye not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant Mos@@ es ?
and the cl@@ oud depar@@ ted from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; and , be@@ hold , Mi@@ ri@@ am became le@@ pro@@ us , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Mi@@ ri@@ am , and , be@@ hold , she was le@@ pro@@ us .
and Aaron said un@@ to Mos@@ es , A@@ las , my lor@@ d , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , lay not the sin upon us , where@@ in we have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly , and where@@ in we have sin@@ ned .
and Mos@@ es by the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord sent them from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an : all those men were heads of the children of Israel .
of the tri@@ be of Joseph , name@@ ly , of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Gad@@ di the son of Sus@@ i .
and Mos@@ es sent them to sp@@ y out the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and said un@@ to them , G@@ et you up this way sou@@ th@@ ward , and go up into the mountain :
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they d@@ well in , whether in ten@@ ts , or in strong holds ;
and they as@@ cen@@ ded by the south , and came un@@ to He@@ br@@ on ; where Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
and they came un@@ to the Bro@@ ok of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from th@@ ence a branch with one cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es , and they b@@ are it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and of the fig@@ s .
the place was called the Bro@@ ok E@@ sh@@ col , because of the cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es which the children of Israel cut down from th@@ ence .
and they went and came to Mos@@ es , and to Aaron , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , un@@ to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an , to K@@ ade@@ sh ; and brought back word un@@ to them , and un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and she@@ wed them the fruit of the land .
the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites d@@ well in the land of the south : and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , d@@ well in the mountains : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ well by the sea , and by the coast of Jordan .
and all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said un@@ to them , Wo@@ uld God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clo@@ th@@ es :
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
if the Lord de@@ light in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is depar@@ ted from them , and the Lord is with us : fear them not .
but all the Con@@ gre@@ gation b@@ ade stone them with stones . and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before all the children of Israel .
and now , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , let the power of my Lord be great , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken , saying ,
par@@ don , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of this people according un@@ to the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , and as th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ given this people , from Egypt even until now .
because all those men which have seen my gl@@ ory , and my mir@@ ac@@ les , which I did in Egypt and in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and have temp@@ ted me now these ten times , and have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to my voice ;
su@@ rely they shall not see the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
( now the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t in the val@@ ley . ) To mor@@ row turn you , and get you into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way of the Red sea .
your car@@ cases shall fall in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and all that were num@@ ber@@ ed of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and up@@ ward , which have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,
doub@@ t@@ less ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sw@@ are to make you d@@ well there@@ in , save Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
but your little ones , which ye said should be a pre@@ y , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have desp@@ ised .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even for@@ ty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , even for@@ ty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the Lord have said , I will su@@ rely do it un@@ to all this ev@@ il Con@@ gre@@ gation , that are gathered together against me : in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they shall be consu@@ med , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Mos@@ es sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the Con@@ gre@@ gation to mur@@ mur against him , by bringing up a s@@ lan@@ der upon the land ,
but Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
and they rose up early in the morning , and g@@ at them up into the top of the mountain , saying , L@@ o , we be here , and will go up un@@ to the place which the Lord hat@@ h promised : for we have sin@@ ned .
for the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the s@@ word : because ye are turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you .
but they pre@@ sumed to go up un@@ to the hill top : nevertheless the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and Mos@@ es , depar@@ ted not out of the camp .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye be come into the land of your habi@@ tations , which I give un@@ to you ,
and will make an offering by fire un@@ to the Lord , a bur@@ n@@ t offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vo@@ w , or in a fre@@ e@@ will offering , or in your so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts , to make a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord , of the her@@ d , or of the flock :
then shall he that offer@@ eth his offering un@@ to the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
thus shall it be done for one bul@@ lock , or for one ram , or for a lam@@ b , or a k@@ id .
according to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord .
and if a st@@ ran@@ ger so@@ jour@@ n with you , or wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordin@@ ance shall be both for you of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and also for the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth with you , an ordin@@ ance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the st@@ ran@@ ger be before the Lord .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye come into the land w@@ hi@@ ther I bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord .
Y@@ e shall offer up a c@@ ake of the first of your d@@ ough for an he@@ ave offering : as ye do the he@@ ave offering of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , so shall ye he@@ ave it .
then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignor@@ ance without the knowledge of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall offer one young bul@@ lock for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and it shall be for@@ given them ; for it is ignor@@ ance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire un@@ to the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignor@@ ance :
and it shall be for@@ given all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignor@@ ance .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h ignor@@ antly , when he sin@@ net@@ h by ignor@@ ance before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him ; and it shall be for@@ given him .
Y@@ e shall have one law for him that sin@@ net@@ h through ignor@@ ance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them .
but the sou@@ l that do@@ eth ought pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a st@@ ran@@ ger , the same re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
and while the children of Israel were in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , they found a man that gathered sti@@ cks upon the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
and they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fr@@ inges in the borders of their gar@@ ments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the f@@ rin@@ ge of the borders a ri@@ b@@ band of blue :
and it shall be un@@ to you for a f@@ rin@@ ge , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a wh@@ oring :
and put fire there@@ in , and put incen@@ se in them before the Lord to mor@@ row : and it shall be that the man whom the Lord do@@ th choose , he shall be hol@@ y : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of L@@ evi .
is it a small thing that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought us up out of a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey , to kill us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , except th@@ ou make th@@ y@@ self altogether a pr@@ ince over us ?
moreover th@@ ou h@@ ast not brought us into a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey , or given us inher@@ it@@ ance of fields and v@@ ine@@ yards : w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up .
and take every man his cen@@ ser , and put incen@@ se in them , and bring ye before the Lord every man his cen@@ ser , two hundred and fif@@ ty cen@@ s@@ ers ; th@@ ou also , and Aaron , each of you his cen@@ ser .
and they took every man his cen@@ ser , and put fire in them , and laid incen@@ se there@@ on , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation with Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and Kor@@ ah gathered all the Con@@ gre@@ gation against them un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
so they g@@ at up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram came out , and stood in the door of their ten@@ ts , and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their little children .
and it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground cla@@ ve as@@ under that was under them :
and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained un@@ to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
speak un@@ to Ele@@ azar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est , that he take up the cen@@ s@@ ers out of the burning , and sc@@ at@@ ter th@@ ou the fire yon@@ der ; for they are hal@@ low@@ ed .
and it came to pass , when the Con@@ gre@@ gation was gathered against Mos@@ es and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and , be@@ hold , the cl@@ oud covered it , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , saying ,
and Aaron took as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded , and ran into the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ; and , be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue was begun among the people : and he put on incen@@ se , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the people .
now they that died in the pla@@ gue were fo@@ ur@@ teen thousand and seven hundred , bes@@ ide them that died about the matter of Kor@@ ah .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a ro@@ d according to the house of their fa@@ thers , of all their pr@@ inces according to the house of their fa@@ thers twelve ro@@ ds : write th@@ ou every man 's name upon his ro@@ d .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt write Aaron 's name upon the ro@@ d of L@@ evi : for one ro@@ d shall be for the head of the house of their fa@@ thers .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt lay them up in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's ro@@ d , whom I shall choose , shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m : and I will make to ce@@ ase from me the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel , where@@ by they mur@@ mur against you .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , and every one of their pr@@ inces gave him a ro@@ d ap@@ i@@ ece , for each pr@@ ince one , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , even twelve ro@@ ds : and the ro@@ d of Aaron was among their ro@@ ds .
and it came to pass , that on the mor@@ row Mos@@ es went into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness ; and , be@@ hold , the ro@@ d of Aaron for the house of L@@ evi was bud@@ ded , and brought forth bu@@ ds , and blo@@ o@@ med b@@ los@@ s@@ oms , and yi@@ elded al@@ mon@@ ds .
and they shall keep TH@@ Y charge , and the charge of all the tab@@ ern@@ acle : only they shall not come n@@ igh the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the alt@@ ar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined un@@ to the@@ e , and keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , for all the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle : and a st@@ ran@@ ger shall not come n@@ igh un@@ to you .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and the charge of the alt@@ ar : that there be no wr@@ ath any more upon the children of Israel .
and I , be@@ hold , I have taken your bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Aaron , be@@ hold , I also have given the@@ e the charge of mine he@@ ave offer@@ ings of all the hal@@ low@@ ed things of the children of Israel ; un@@ to the@@ e have I given them by reason of the ano@@ in@@ ting , and to TH@@ Y sons , by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
this shall be th@@ ine of the most hol@@ y things , reserved from the fire : every ob@@ lation of the@@ ir@@ s , every meat offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every sin offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every t@@ res@@ pass offering of the@@ ir@@ s , which they shall ren@@ der un@@ to me , shall be most hol@@ y for the@@ e and for TH@@ Y sons .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of them which they shall offer un@@ to the Lord , them have I given the@@ e .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is first ri@@ pe in the land , which they shall bring un@@ to the Lord , shall be th@@ ine ; every one that is clean in th@@ ine house shall eat of it .
and those that are to be re@@ deemed from a month old s@@ halt th@@ ou re@@ de@@ em , according to th@@ ine esti@@ mation , for the money of five sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Aaron , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt have no inher@@ it@@ ance in their land , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou have any part among them : I am TH@@ Y part and th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance among the children of Israel .
and , be@@ hold , I have given the children of L@@ evi all the tenth in Israel for an inher@@ it@@ ance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
but the L@@ evi@@ tes shall do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inher@@ it@@ ance .
but the ti@@ th@@ es of the children of Israel , which they offer as an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord , I have given to the L@@ evi@@ tes to inher@@ it : therefore I have said un@@ to them , A@@ mon@@ g the children of Israel they shall have no inher@@ it@@ ance .
thus speak un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , and say un@@ to them , When ye take of the children of Israel the ti@@ th@@ es which I have given you from them for your inher@@ it@@ ance , then ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the ti@@ the .
and this your he@@ ave offering shall be rec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to you , as though it were the cor@@ n of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and as the ful@@ ness of the win@@ e@@ press .
thus ye also shall offer an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord of all your ti@@ th@@ es , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give there@@ of the Lord 's he@@ ave offering to Aaron the pri@@ est .
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every he@@ ave offering of the Lord , of all the best there@@ of , even the hal@@ low@@ ed part there@@ of out of it .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , When ye have heav@@ ed the best there@@ of from it , then it shall be counted un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes as the increase of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and as the increase of the win@@ e@@ press .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heav@@ ed from it the best of it : neither shall ye poll@@ ute the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , lest ye die .
this is the ordin@@ ance of the law which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying , Spe@@ ak un@@ to the children of Israel , that they bring the@@ e a red he@@ if@@ er without spot , where@@ in is no ble@@ mis@@ h , and upon which never came yok@@ e :
and ye shall give her un@@ to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall s@@ lay her before his face :
and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est shall take of her blood with his fin@@ ger , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le of her blood directly before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation seven times :
and one shall bur@@ n the he@@ if@@ er in his sight ; her s@@ kin , and her f@@ les@@ h , and her blood , with her D@@ ung , shall he bur@@ n :
and the pri@@ est shall take c@@ ed@@ ar wood , and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and scar@@ let , and cast it into the mid@@ st of the burning of the he@@ if@@ er .
then the pri@@ est shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and he shall ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp , and the pri@@ est shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that bur@@ net@@ h her shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es in water , and ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that gather@@ eth the ashes of the he@@ if@@ er shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even : and it shall be un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them , for a statute for ever .
he shall pur@@ ify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he pur@@ ify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth the dead body of any man that is dead , and pur@@ i@@ fi@@ eth not himself , def@@ il@@ eth the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him , he shall be un@@ clean ; his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess is yet upon him .
this is the law , when a man di@@ eth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shall be un@@ clean seven days .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth one that is sla@@ in with a s@@ word in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be un@@ clean seven days .
and for an un@@ clean person they shall take of the ashes of the bur@@ n@@ t he@@ if@@ er of pur@@ ification for sin , and running water shall be put there@@ to in a ves@@ sel :
and the clean person shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le upon the un@@ clean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall pur@@ ify himself , and was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be un@@ clean , and shall not pur@@ ify himself , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , because he hat@@ h def@@ iled the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord : the water of separation hat@@ h not been sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him ; he is un@@ clean .
and it shall be a perpet@@ ual statute un@@ to them , that he that sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le@@ th the water of separation shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es ; and he that tou@@ ch@@ eth the water of separation shall be un@@ clean until even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation , into the de@@ sert of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people abo@@ de in K@@ ade@@ sh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
and where@@ fore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in un@@ to this ev@@ il place ? it is no place of se@@ ed , or of fig@@ s , or of v@@ ines , or of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates ; neither is there any water to drink .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and they fell upon their faces : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to them .
and Mos@@ es lifted up his hand , and with his ro@@ d he smo@@ te the rock twice : and the water came out ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation d@@ rank , and their be@@ asts also .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and Aaron , Bec@@ ause ye believed me not , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this Con@@ gre@@ gation into the land which I have given them .
how our fa@@ thers went down into Egypt , and we have d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans v@@ ex@@ ed us , and our fa@@ thers :
and when we cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , he heard our voice , and sent an an@@ gel , and hat@@ h brought us forth out of Egypt : and , be@@ hold , we are in K@@ ade@@ sh , a city in the ut@@ ter@@ most of TH@@ Y border :
and the children of Israel , even the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation , jour@@ ne@@ yed from K@@ ade@@ sh , and came un@@ to mount H@@ or .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and Aaron in mount H@@ or , by the coast of the land of E@@ dom , saying ,
Aaron shall be gathered un@@ to his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given un@@ to the children of Israel , because ye rebel@@ led against my word at the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah .
and stri@@ p Aaron of his gar@@ ments , and put them upon Ele@@ azar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered un@@ to his people , and shall die there .
and Mos@@ es stri@@ pped Aaron of his gar@@ ments , and put them upon Ele@@ azar his son ; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar came down from the mount .
and when king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the sp@@ ies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from mount H@@ or by the way of the Red sea , to comp@@ ass the land of E@@ dom : and the sou@@ l of the people was much dis@@ cour@@ aged because of the way .
therefore the people came to Mos@@ es , and said , We have sin@@ ned , for we have spoken against the Lord , and against the@@ e ; pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord , that he take away the Ser@@ pen@@ ts from us . and Mos@@ es pray@@ ed for the people .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Mak@@ e the@@ e a fi@@ ery ser@@ p@@ ent , and set it upon a pol@@ e : and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bit@@ ten , when he lo@@ ok@@ eth upon it , shall live .
and Mos@@ es made a ser@@ p@@ ent of br@@ ass , and put it upon a pol@@ e , and it came to pass , that if a ser@@ p@@ ent had bit@@ ten any man , when he be@@ held the ser@@ p@@ ent of br@@ ass , he lived .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from O@@ both , and pit@@ ched at I@@ je @@@ -@@ @ ab@@ ar@@ im , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness which is before Mo@@ a@@ b , toward the sun@@ rising .
from th@@ ence they removed , and pit@@ ched on the other side of Ar@@ non , which is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness that co@@ me@@ th out of the co@@ asts of the Am@@ ori@@ tes : for Ar@@ non is the border of Mo@@ a@@ b , between Mo@@ a@@ b and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
and at the stream of the bro@@ oks that go@@ eth down to the d@@ wel@@ ling of A@@ r , and li@@ eth upon the border of Mo@@ a@@ b .
the pr@@ inces dig@@ ged the well , the no@@ bles of the people dig@@ ged it , by the direction of the law@@ gi@@ ver , with their st@@ aves . and from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they went to Mat@@ tan@@ ah :
and from B@@ am@@ o@@ th in the val@@ ley , that is in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward J@@ es@@ him@@ on .
let me pass through TH@@ Y land : we will not turn into the fields , or into the v@@ ine@@ yards ; we will not drink of the waters of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past TH@@ Y borders .
and S@@ ih@@ on would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but S@@ ih@@ on gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and he came to Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
and Israel smo@@ te him with the edge of the s@@ word , and poss@@ essed his land from Ar@@ non un@@ to J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , even un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon : for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
and Israel took all these cities : and Israel d@@ wel@@ t in all the cities of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and in all the villages there@@ of .
for H@@ es@@ h@@ bon was the city of S@@ ih@@ on the king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and taken all his land out of his hand , even un@@ to Ar@@ non .
for there is a fire gone out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , a fla@@ me from the city of S@@ ih@@ on : it hat@@ h consu@@ med A@@ r of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the lor@@ ds of the high places of Ar@@ non .
and they turned and went up by the way of B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
and Mo@@ a@@ b was sor@@ e afraid of the people , because they were many : and Mo@@ a@@ b was dist@@ ressed because of the children of Israel .
and the el@@ ders of Mo@@ a@@ b and the el@@ ders of Mi@@ dian depar@@ ted with the re@@ wards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
be@@ hold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which cover@@ eth the face of the ear@@ th : come now , cur@@ se me them ; per@@ ad@@ venture I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and Bal@@ a@@ am rose up in the morning , and said un@@ to the pr@@ inces of Bal@@ ak , G@@ et you into your land : for the Lord ref@@ us@@ eth to give me leave to go with you .
and Bal@@ a@@ am answ@@ ered and said un@@ to the servants of Bal@@ ak , If Bal@@ ak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I can@@ not go beyond the word of the Lord my God , to do less or more .
and God came un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am at night , and said un@@ to him , If the men come to call the@@ e , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say un@@ to the@@ e , that s@@ halt th@@ ou do .
and God 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led because he went : and the an@@ gel of the Lord stood in the way for an ad@@ versary against him . now he was ri@@ ding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am smo@@ te the ass , to turn her into the way .
but the an@@ gel of the Lord stood in a path of the v@@ ine@@ yards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she th@@ rust her@@ self un@@ to the wall , and cr@@ us@@ hed Bal@@ a@@ am 's fo@@ ot against the wall : and he smo@@ te her again .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she fell down under Bal@@ a@@ am : and Bal@@ a@@ am 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led , and he smo@@ te the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and he bo@@ wed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , su@@ rely now also I had sla@@ in the@@ e , and sav@@ ed her alive .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said un@@ to the an@@ gel of the Lord , I have sin@@ ned ; for I knew not that th@@ ou st@@ oo@@ dest in the way against me : now therefore , if it disp@@ le@@ ase the@@ e , I will get me back again .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , G@@ o with the men : but only the word that I shall speak un@@ to the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt speak . so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the pr@@ inces of Bal@@ ak .
and when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am was come , he went out to meet him un@@ to a city of Mo@@ a@@ b , which is in the border of Ar@@ non , which is in the ut@@ most coast .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said un@@ to Bal@@ ak , L@@ o , I am come un@@ to the@@ e : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God p@@ ut@@ te@@ th in my m@@ outh , that shall I speak .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Bal@@ ak took Bal@@ a@@ am , and brought him up into the high places of Ba@@ al , that th@@ ence he might see the ut@@ most part of the people .
for from the top of the ro@@ cks I see him , and from the hil@@ ls I be@@ hold him : lo , the people shall d@@ well alone , and shall not be rec@@ kon@@ ed among the nations .
who can count the d@@ ust of Jac@@ o@@ b , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righ@@ te@@ ous , and let my last end be like his !
he hat@@ h not be@@ held in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in Jac@@ o@@ b , neither hat@@ h he seen per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess in Israel : the Lord his God is with him , and the sh@@ out of a king is among them .
be@@ hold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the pre@@ y , and drink the blood of the sla@@ in .
and when Bal@@ a@@ am saw that it pleased the Lord to b@@ less Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for en@@ chan@@ tments , but he set his face toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Bal@@ a@@ am lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abi@@ ding in his ten@@ ts according to their tri@@ bes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
and he took up his par@@ able , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hat@@ h said , and the man whose eyes are open hat@@ h said :
as the val@@ ley@@ s are they spread forth , as gar@@ den@@ s by the river 's side , as the trees of lig@@ n alo@@ es which the Lord hat@@ h plan@@ ted , and as c@@ ed@@ ar trees bes@@ ide the waters .
he shall p@@ our the water out of his bu@@ c@@ kets , and his se@@ ed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than A@@ ga@@ g , and his k@@ ing@@ dom shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hat@@ h as it were the strength of an un@@ ic@@ or@@ n : he shall eat up the nations his enem@@ ies , and shall break their b@@ ones , and Pi@@ erce them through with his ar@@ ro@@ ws .
and Bal@@ ak 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he smo@@ te his hands together : and Bal@@ ak said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , I called the@@ e to cur@@ se mine enem@@ ies , and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast altogether b@@ les@@ sed them these three times .
and now , be@@ hold , I go un@@ to my people : come therefore , and I will adverti@@ se the@@ e what this people shall do to TH@@ Y people in the latter days .
and he took up his par@@ able , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hat@@ h said , and the man whose eyes are open hat@@ h said :
he hat@@ h said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , falling into a tr@@ ance , but having his eyes open :
and when he looked on A@@ mal@@ ek , he took up his par@@ able , and said , A@@ mal@@ ek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he per@@ ish for ever .
and he looked on the Ken@@ ites , and took up his par@@ able , and said , Str@@ ong is TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ place , and th@@ ou p@@ ut@@ test TH@@ Y n@@ est in a rock .
and ships shall come from the coast of Ch@@ it@@ tim , and shall aff@@ lic@@ t As@@ sh@@ ur , and shall aff@@ lic@@ t E@@ ber , and he also shall per@@ ish for ever .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , T@@ ake all the heads of the people , and han@@ g them up before the Lord against the sun , that the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel .
and , be@@ hold , one of the children of Israel came and brought un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren a Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman in the sight of Mos@@ es , and in the sight of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , who were we@@ eping before the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ azar , the son of Aaron the pri@@ est , saw it , he rose up from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and took a j@@ av@@ elin in his hand ;
and he shall have it , and his se@@ ed after him , even the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of an ever@@ lasting pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; because he was z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for his God , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the children of Israel .
now the name of the Isra@@ elite that was sla@@ in , even that was sla@@ in with the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman , was Z@@ im@@ ri , the son of Sal@@ u , a pr@@ ince of a chief house among the Sime@@ on@@ ites .
and the name of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman that was sla@@ in was Co@@ z@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Mi@@ dian .
Re@@ ub@@ en , the el@@ dest son of Israel : the children of Re@@ ub@@ en ; Han@@ o@@ ch , of whom co@@ me@@ th the family of the Han@@ o@@ chi@@ tes : of Pal@@ lu , the family of the Pal@@ lu@@ ites :

and the sons of Eli@@ a@@ b ; Nem@@ uel , and Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram . this is that Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram , which were famous in the Con@@ gre@@ gation , who stro@@ ve against Mos@@ es and against Aaron in the company of Kor@@ ah , when they stro@@ ve against the Lord :
and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up together with Kor@@ ah , when that company died , what time the fire dev@@ oured two hundred and fif@@ ty men : and they became a sign .

these are the families of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families : and they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were for@@ ty and five thousand and four hundred .
these were the num@@ ber@@ ed of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
to many th@@ ou s@@ halt give the more inher@@ it@@ ance , and to few th@@ ou s@@ halt give the less inher@@ it@@ ance : to every one shall his inher@@ it@@ ance be given according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of him .
and these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the L@@ evi@@ tes after their families : of Ger@@ sh@@ on , the family of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites : of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the family of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : of Mer@@ ari , the family of the Mer@@ ar@@ ites .
these are the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes : the family of the Lib@@ ni@@ tes , the family of the He@@ bron@@ ites , the family of the Mah@@ li@@ tes , the family of the Mus@@ hi@@ tes , the family of the Kor@@ ath@@ ites . and Ko@@ hat@@ h beg@@ at Am@@ ram .
and the name of Am@@ ram 's wife was Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed , the daughter of L@@ evi , whom her mother b@@ are to L@@ evi in Egypt : and she b@@ are un@@ to Am@@ ram Aaron and Mos@@ es , and Mi@@ ri@@ am their sister .
and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were twenty and three thousand , all mal@@ es from a month old and up@@ ward : for they were not num@@ ber@@ ed among the children of Israel , because there was no inher@@ it@@ ance given them among the children of Israel .
these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed by Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , who num@@ ber@@ ed the children of Israel in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but among these there was not a man of them whom Mos@@ es and Aaron the pri@@ est num@@ ber@@ ed , when they num@@ ber@@ ed the children of Israel in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
our father died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kor@@ ah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hat@@ h no son ? give un@@ to us therefore a possession among the bre@@ th@@ ren of our father .
the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had speak right : th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely give them a possession of an inher@@ it@@ ance among their father 's bre@@ th@@ ren ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause the inher@@ it@@ ance of their father to pass un@@ to them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inher@@ it@@ ance to pass un@@ to his daughter .
and if he have no daughter , then ye shall give his inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and if he have no bre@@ th@@ ren , then ye shall give his inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to his father 's bre@@ th@@ ren .
for ye rebel@@ led against my comman@@ d@@ ment in the de@@ sert of Z@@ in , in the stri@@ fe of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah in K@@ ade@@ sh in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord , saying ,
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord be not as she@@ ep which have no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt put some of th@@ ine honour upon him , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel may be obe@@ di@@ ent .
and he shall stand before Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , who shall ask coun@@ sel for him after the judgment of U@@ rim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and Mos@@ es did as the Lord comman@@ ded him : and he took Jos@@ hua , and set him before Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and before all the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es .
command the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , My offering , and my bread for my sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es made by fire , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to me , shall ye observe to offer un@@ to me in their due season .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer un@@ to the Lord ; two lam@@ bs of the first year without spot day by day , for a contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering .
the one lam@@ b s@@ halt th@@ ou offer in the morning , and the other lam@@ b s@@ halt th@@ ou offer at even ;
it is a contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , which was or@@ da@@ ined in mount S@@ ina@@ i for a swe@@ et sav@@ our , a sacrifice made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and the drink offering there@@ of shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lam@@ b : in the hol@@ y place s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the strong wine to be p@@ oured un@@ to the Lord for a drink offering .
and three tenth deals of fl@@ our for a meat offering , min@@ g@@ led with oil , for one bul@@ lock ; and two tenth deals of fl@@ our for a meat offering , min@@ g@@ led with oil , for one ram ;
and their drink offer@@ ings shall be half an hin of wine un@@ to a bul@@ lock , and the third part of an hin un@@ to a ram , and a fourth part of an hin un@@ to a lam@@ b : this is the bur@@ n@@ t offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord ; two young bul@@ loc@@ ks , and one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year : they shall be un@@ to you without ble@@ mis@@ h :
after this manner ye shall offer daily , throughout the seven days , the meat of the sacrifice made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord : it shall be offered bes@@ ide the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , and his drink offering .
also in the day of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its , when ye bring a new meat offering un@@ to the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work :
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work : it is a day of b@@ low@@ ing the tr@@ ump@@ ets un@@ to you .
but ye shall offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord for a swe@@ et sav@@ our ; one young bul@@ lock , one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year ; they shall be un@@ to you without ble@@ mis@@ h :
and ye shall offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord ; thir@@ teen young bul@@ loc@@ ks , two r@@ ams , and fo@@ ur@@ teen lam@@ bs of the first year ; they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
but ye shall offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord : one bul@@ lock , one ram , seven lam@@ bs of the first year without ble@@ mis@@ h :
their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ lock , for the ram , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
these things ye shall do un@@ to the Lord in your set fe@@ asts , bes@@ ide your vows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , for your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and for your meat offer@@ ings , and for your drink offer@@ ings , and for your peace offer@@ ings .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the heads of the tri@@ bes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded .
if a man vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , or swe@@ ar an oath to bin@@ d his sou@@ l with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proce@@ ede@@ th out of his m@@ outh .
and her father hear her vo@@ w , and her bond where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her father dis@@ allow her in the day that he he@@ aret@@ h ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l , shall stand : and the Lord shall for@@ give her , because her father dis@@ allowed her .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her husband dis@@ allowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vo@@ w which she vowed , and that which she ut@@ tered with her li@@ ps , where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l , of none effect : and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but if her husband hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly made them vo@@ id on the day he heard them ; then wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever proce@@ eded out of her li@@ ps concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her sou@@ l , shall not stand : her husband hat@@ h made them vo@@ id ; and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establis@@ het@@ h all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confir@@ me@@ th them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
these are the stat@@ utes , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father 's house .
and Mos@@ es sent them to the war , a thousand of every tri@@ be , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the hol@@ y instruments , and the tr@@ ump@@ ets to blow in his hand .
and they sle@@ w the kings of Mi@@ dian , bes@@ ide the rest of them that were sla@@ in ; name@@ ly , Evi , and Rek@@ em , and Z@@ ur , and H@@ ur , and Re@@ ba , five kings of Mi@@ dian : Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or they sle@@ w with the s@@ word .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Mi@@ dian cap@@ tives , and their little ones , and took the sp@@ oil of all their c@@ attle , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods .
and they brought the cap@@ tives , and the pre@@ y , and the sp@@ oil , un@@ to Mos@@ es , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , un@@ to the camp at the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , which are by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with the officers of the host , with the cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
be@@ hold , these caused the children of Israel , through the coun@@ sel of Bal@@ a@@ am , to commit t@@ res@@ pass against the Lord in the matter of Pe@@ or , and there was a pla@@ gue among the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hat@@ h known man by lying with him .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h killed any person , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h touched any sla@@ in , pur@@ ify both yo@@ ur@@ selves and your cap@@ tives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and pur@@ ify all your ra@@ im@@ ent , and all that is made of sk@@ ins , and all work of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir , and all things made of wood .
and ye shall was@@ h your clo@@ th@@ es on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and after@@ ward ye shall come into the camp .
take the sum of the pre@@ y that was taken , both of man and of be@@ ast , th@@ ou , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the chief fa@@ thers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and divide the pre@@ y into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and lev@@ y a tri@@ bute un@@ to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one sou@@ l of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the be@@ ev@@ es , and of the ass@@ es , and of the she@@ ep :
and the bo@@ o@@ ty , being the rest of the pre@@ y which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and sev@@ enty thousand and five thousand she@@ ep ,
and thirty and two thousand persons in all , of woman that had not known man by lying with him .
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred she@@ ep :
and Mos@@ es gave the tri@@ bute , which was the Lord 's he@@ ave offering , un@@ to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
( now the half that per@@ tained un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred she@@ ep ,
even of the children of Israel 's half , Mos@@ es took one portion of fif@@ ty , both of man and of be@@ ast , and gave them un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , which kept the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near un@@ to Mos@@ es :
and they said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ y servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there la@@ c@@ ket@@ h not one man of us .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
and Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est took the gold of the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .
now the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad had a very great multi@@ tude of c@@ attle : and when they saw the land of Jaz@@ er , and the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that , be@@ hold , the place was a place for c@@ attle ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , said they , if we have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , let this land be given un@@ to TH@@ Y servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and where@@ fore dis@@ courage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hat@@ h given them ?
for when they went up un@@ to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they dis@@ cour@@ aged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
and the Lord 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , that had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , was consu@@ med .
and , be@@ hold , ye are risen up in your fa@@ thers ' stead , an increase of s@@ inf@@ ul men , to a@@ ug@@ ment yet the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord toward Israel .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them un@@ to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the f@@ enced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return un@@ to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inher@@ it@@ ance .
and the land be sub@@ du@@ ed before the Lord : then after@@ ward ye shall return , and be guil@@ t@@ less before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
so concerning them Mos@@ es comman@@ ded Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the chief fa@@ thers of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel :
and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en answ@@ ered , saying , As the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to TH@@ Y servants , so will we do .
and Mos@@ es gave un@@ to them , even to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and un@@ to half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , the k@@ ing@@ dom of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the land , with the cities there@@ of in the co@@ asts , even the cities of the country round about .
and the children of G@@ ad built Di@@ bon , and A@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and A@@ ro@@ er ,
and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en built H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , and Kir@@ j@@ ath@@ aim ,
and the children of Mac@@ hir the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h went to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and took it , and dis@@ poss@@ essed the Am@@ or@@ ite which was in it .
these are the jour@@ neys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and Mos@@ es wrote their go@@ ings out according to their jour@@ neys by the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord : and these are their jour@@ neys according to their go@@ ings out .
and they depar@@ ted from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the mor@@ row after the pass@@ over the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and they depar@@ ted from Suc@@ co@@ th , and pit@@ ched in Eth@@ am , which is in the edge of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and they removed from Eth@@ am , and turned again un@@ to P@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , which is before Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ z@@ ep@@ h@@ on : and they pit@@ ched before Mig@@ dol .
and they depar@@ ted from before P@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , and passed through the mid@@ st of the sea into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and went three days ' journey in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Eth@@ am , and pit@@ ched in Mar@@ ah .
and they removed from Mar@@ ah , and came un@@ to E@@ lim : and in E@@ lim were twelve fo@@ un@@ tains of water , and thre@@ es@@ core and ten pal@@ m trees ; and they pit@@ ched there .
and they took their journey out of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , and en@@ camp@@ ed in D@@ oph@@ k@@ ah .
and they removed from K@@ ade@@ sh , and pit@@ ched in mount H@@ or , in the edge of the land of E@@ dom .
and Aaron the pri@@ est went up into mount H@@ or at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , and died there , in the for@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their m@@ ol@@ ten images , and quite p@@ lu@@ ck down all their high places :
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pri@@ cks in your eyes , and thor@@ ns in your sides , and shall ve@@ x you in the land where@@ in ye d@@ well .
moreover it shall come to pass , that I shall do un@@ to you , as I thought to do un@@ to them .
command the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; ( this is the land that shall fall un@@ to you for an inher@@ it@@ ance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an with the co@@ asts there@@ of : )
then your south quarter shall be from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in along by the coast of E@@ dom , and your south border shall be the out@@ most coast of the salt sea eas@@ tw@@ ard :
and your border shall turn from the south to the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass on to Z@@ in : and the going forth there@@ of shall be from the south to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea , and shall go on to Hazar @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , and pass on to Az@@ mon :
and the border shall f@@ et@@ ch a comp@@ ass from Az@@ mon un@@ to the river of Egypt , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the sea .
from mount H@@ or ye shall point out your border un@@ to the entrance of Ham@@ ath ; and the go@@ ings forth of the border shall be to Z@@ ed@@ ad :
and the border shall go on to Z@@ ip@@ h@@ ron , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at Hazar @@@ -@@ @ en@@ an : this shall be your north border .
and the coast shall go down from S@@ hep@@ ham to R@@ ib@@ lah , on the east side of A@@ in ; and the border shall des@@ cen@@ d , and shall reach un@@ to the side of the sea of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard :
for the tri@@ be of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en according to the house of their fa@@ thers , and the tri@@ be of the children of G@@ ad according to the house of their fa@@ thers , have received their inher@@ it@@ ance ; and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have received their inher@@ it@@ ance :
and the pr@@ ince of the tri@@ be of the children of Dan , Buk@@ ki the son of Jo@@ g@@ li .
the pr@@ ince of the children of Joseph , for the tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , H@@ anni@@ el the son of E@@ pho@@ d .
and the pr@@ ince of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Kem@@ uel the son of Shi@@ ph@@ tan .
and the pr@@ ince of the tri@@ be of the children of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Eli@@ z@@ ap@@ han the son of Par@@ n@@ ach .
and the pr@@ ince of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her , A@@ hi@@ h@@ ud the son of S@@ hel@@ om@@ i .
command the children of Israel , that they give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes of the inher@@ it@@ ance of their possession cities to d@@ well in ; and ye shall give also un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes subur@@ bs for the cities round about them .
and the cities shall they have to d@@ well in ; and the subur@@ bs of them shall be for their c@@ attle , and for their goods , and for all their be@@ asts .
and the subur@@ bs of the cities , which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall reach from the wall of the city and ou@@ tw@@ ard a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes there shall be six cities for ref@@ uge , which ye shall appoint for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , that he may flee th@@ ither : and to them ye shall add for@@ ty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be for@@ ty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their subur@@ bs .
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of ref@@ uge for you ; that the S@@ lay@@ er may flee th@@ ither , which kil@@ le@@ th any person at un@@ awar@@ es .
Y@@ e shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which shall be cities of ref@@ uge .
these six cities shall be a ref@@ uge , both for the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger , and for the so@@ jour@@ ner among them : that every one that kil@@ le@@ th any person un@@ awar@@ es may flee th@@ ither .
or in en@@ mity sm@@ ite him with his hand , that he die : he that smo@@ te him shall su@@ rely be put to death ; for he is a mur@@ der@@ er : the reven@@ ger of blood shall s@@ lay the mur@@ der@@ er , when he me@@ ete@@ th him .
or with any stone , where@@ with a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
and the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall deliver the S@@ lay@@ er out of the hand of the reven@@ ger of blood , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall restore him to the city of his ref@@ uge , w@@ hi@@ ther he was fled : and he shall abide in it un@@ to the death of the high pri@@ est , which was ano@@ in@@ ted with the hol@@ y oil .
but if the S@@ lay@@ er shall at any time come without the border of the city of his ref@@ uge , w@@ hi@@ ther he was fled ;
and the reven@@ ger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his ref@@ uge , and the reven@@ ger of blood kill the S@@ lay@@ er ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his ref@@ uge until the death of the high pri@@ est : but after the death of the high pri@@ est the S@@ lay@@ er shall return into the land of his possession .
W@@ hos@@ o kil@@ le@@ th any person , the mur@@ der@@ er shall be put to death by the m@@ outh of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a mur@@ der@@ er , which is guilty of death : but he shall be su@@ rely put to death .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his ref@@ uge , that he should come again to d@@ well in the land , until the death of the pri@@ est .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it def@@ il@@ eth the land : and the land can@@ not be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed there@@ in , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and the chief fa@@ thers of the families of the children of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and sp@@ ake before Mos@@ es , and before the pr@@ inces , the chief fa@@ thers of the children of Israel :
and they said , The Lord comman@@ ded my lor@@ d to give the land for an inher@@ it@@ ance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lor@@ d was comman@@ ded by the Lord to give the inher@@ it@@ ance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother un@@ to his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and when the j@@ ub@@ ile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inher@@ it@@ ance be put un@@ to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be where@@ un@@ to they are received : so shall their inher@@ it@@ ance be taken away from the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of our fa@@ thers .
this is the thing which the Lord do@@ th command concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them mar@@ ry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tri@@ be of their father shall they mar@@ ry .
so shall not the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Israel remove from tri@@ be to tri@@ be : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of his fa@@ thers .
and every daughter , that poss@@ ess@@ eth an inher@@ it@@ ance in any tri@@ be of the children of Israel , shall be wife un@@ to one of the family of the tri@@ be of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inher@@ it@@ ance of his fa@@ thers .
neither shall the inher@@ it@@ ance remove from one tri@@ be to another tri@@ be ; but every one of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inher@@ it@@ ance .
and they were married into the families of the sons of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , and their inher@@ it@@ ance remained in the tri@@ be of the family of their father .
these are the comman@@ d@@ ments and the judg@@ ments , which the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es un@@ to the children of Israel in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and it came to pass in the for@@ ti@@ eth year , in the ele@@ venth month , on the first day of the month , that Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , according un@@ to all that the Lord had given him in comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to them ;
be@@ hold , I have set the land before you : go in and poss@@ ess the land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b , to give un@@ to them and to their se@@ ed after them .
the Lord your God hat@@ h multi@@ p@@ lied you , and , be@@ hold , ye are this day as the stars of heav@@ en for multi@@ tude .
( the Lord God of your fa@@ thers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and b@@ less you , as he hat@@ h promised you ! )
and I said un@@ to you , Y@@ e are come un@@ to the mountain of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which the Lord our God do@@ th give un@@ to us .
and they turned and went up into the mountain , and came un@@ to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and searched it out .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down un@@ to us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God do@@ th give us .
and ye mur@@ mu@@ red in your ten@@ ts , and said , Bec@@ ause the Lord ha@@ ted us , he hat@@ h brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to destroy us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to she@@ w you by what way ye should go , and in a cl@@ oud by day .
but Jos@@ hua the son of nun , which stan@@ de@@ th before the@@ e , he shall go in th@@ ither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inher@@ it it .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a pre@@ y , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and ev@@ il , they shall go in th@@ ither , and un@@ to them will I give it , and they shall poss@@ ess it .
and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t in that mountain , came out against you , and ch@@ ased you , as be@@ es do , and destroyed you in Se@@ ir , even un@@ to Hor@@ ma@@ h .
then we turned , and took our journey into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way of the Red sea , as the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to me : and we comp@@ ass@@ ed mount Se@@ ir many days .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to me , saying ,
and command th@@ ou the people , saying , Y@@ e are to pass through the coast of your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore :
Y@@ e shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
and when we passed by from our bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ wel@@ t in Se@@ ir , through the way of the pla@@ in from E@@ la@@ th , and from E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ g@@ ab@@ er , we turned and passed by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Mo@@ a@@ b .
for indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consu@@ med .
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consu@@ med and dead from among the people ,
and the Av@@ ims which d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ er@@ im , even un@@ to Az@@ z@@ ah , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ ims , which came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead . )
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Ar@@ non : be@@ hold , I have given into th@@ ine hand S@@ ih@@ on the Am@@ or@@ ite , king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and his land : begin to poss@@ ess it , and conten@@ d with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dre@@ ad of the@@ e and the fear of the@@ e upon the nations that are under the whole heav@@ en , who shall hear report of the@@ e , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and be in an@@ gu@@ ish because of the@@ e .
let me pass through TH@@ Y land : I will go along by the high way , I will neither turn un@@ to the right hand nor to the left .
and we took all his cities at that time , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
only the c@@ attle we took for a pre@@ y un@@ to ourselves , and the sp@@ oil of the cities which we took .
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the br@@ ink of the river of Ar@@ non , and from the city that is by the river , even un@@ to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , there was not one city too strong for us : the Lord our God delivered all un@@ to us :
only un@@ to the land of the children of Am@@ mon th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st not , nor un@@ to any place of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , nor un@@ to the cities in the mountains , nor un@@ to wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God for@@ bad us .
then we turned , and went up the way to B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , Fe@@ ar him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into TH@@ Y hand ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt do un@@ to him as th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st un@@ to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t at H@@ es@@ h@@ bon .
so the Lord our God delivered into our hands O@@ g also , the king of B@@ ash@@ an , and all his people : and we smo@@ te him until none was left to him remaining .
and we took all his cities at that time , there was not a city which we took not from them , thre@@ es@@ core cities , all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g in B@@ ash@@ an .
but all the c@@ attle , and the sp@@ oil of the cities , we took for a pre@@ y to ourselves .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon ;
and this land , which we poss@@ essed at that time , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the river Ar@@ non , and half mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and the cities there@@ of , gave I un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes .
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , being the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , with all B@@ ash@@ an , which was called the land of gi@@ ants .
and un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and un@@ to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even un@@ to the river Ar@@ non half the val@@ ley , and the border even un@@ to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
the pla@@ in also , and Jordan , and the coast there@@ of , from Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth even un@@ to the sea of the pla@@ in , even the salt sea , under Ash@@ do@@ th @@@ -@@ @ p@@ is@@ ga@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and I comman@@ ded you at that time , saying , The Lord your God hat@@ h given you this land to poss@@ ess it : ye shall pass over armed before your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel , all that are meet for the war .
and I comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua at that time , saying , Th@@ ine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hat@@ h done un@@ to these two kings : so shall the Lord do un@@ to all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou pass@@ est .
O Lord God , th@@ ou h@@ ast begun to she@@ w TH@@ Y ser@@ vant TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand : for what God is there in heav@@ en or in ear@@ th , that can do according to TH@@ Y works , and according to TH@@ Y might ?
get the@@ e up into the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and lift up th@@ ine eyes w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and be@@ hold it with th@@ ine eyes : for th@@ ou s@@ halt not go over this Jordan .
Y@@ e shall not add un@@ to the word which I command you , neither shall ye dimin@@ ish ought from it , that ye may keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God which I command you .
your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : for all the men that followed Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h destroyed them from among you .
but ye that did cle@@ ave un@@ to the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day .
for what nation is there so great , who hat@@ h God so n@@ igh un@@ to them , as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for ?
only take heed to th@@ y@@ self , and keep TH@@ Y sou@@ l dil@@ ig@@ ently , lest th@@ ou forget the things which th@@ ine eyes have seen , and lest they de@@ part from TH@@ Y heart all the days of TH@@ Y life : but te@@ ach them TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y sons ' sons ;
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you out of the mid@@ st of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no si@@ milit@@ u@@ de ; only ye heard a voice .
and he declared un@@ to you his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which he comman@@ ded you to perform , even ten comman@@ d@@ ments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
and the Lord comman@@ ded me at that time to te@@ ach you stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , that ye might do them in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go over to poss@@ ess it .
take ye therefore good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves ; for ye saw no manner of si@@ milit@@ u@@ de on the day that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you in Ho@@ re@@ b out of the mid@@ st of the fire :
but the Lord hat@@ h taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron fur@@ n@@ ace , even out of Egypt , to be un@@ to him a people of inher@@ it@@ ance , as ye are this day .
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sak@@ es , and sw@@ are that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in un@@ to that good land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance :
take heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest ye forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a Gra@@ ven image , or the lik@@ eness of any thing , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h for@@ bid@@ den the@@ e .
and the Lord shall sc@@ at@@ ter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord shall lead you .
and there ye shall serve go@@ ds , the work of men 's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor s@@ me@@ ll .
but if from th@@ ence th@@ ou s@@ halt seek the Lord TH@@ Y God , th@@ ou s@@ halt find him , if th@@ ou seek him with all TH@@ Y heart and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
when th@@ ou art in tri@@ bu@@ lation , and all these things are come upon the@@ e , even in the latter days , if th@@ ou turn to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and s@@ halt be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to his voice ;
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a mer@@ ci@@ ful God ; ) he will not for@@ sake the@@ e , neither destroy the@@ e , nor forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers which he sw@@ are un@@ to them .
out of heav@@ en he made the@@ e to hear his voice , that he might instruc@@ t the@@ e : and upon ear@@ th he she@@ wed the@@ e his great fire ; and th@@ ou hear@@ dest his words out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
and because he lov@@ ed TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , therefore he chose their se@@ ed after them , and brought the@@ e out in his sight with his m@@ igh@@ ty power out of Egypt ;
that the S@@ lay@@ er might flee th@@ ither , which should kill his neighbour un@@ awar@@ es , and ha@@ ted him not in times past ; and that fle@@ eing un@@ to one of these cities he might live :
name@@ ly , B@@ ez@@ er in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in the pla@@ in country , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites ; and Ram@@ o@@ th in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , of the G@@ adi@@ tes ; and G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an , of the Man@@ as@@ sites .
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
and they poss@@ essed his land , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which were on this side Jordan toward the sun@@ rising ;
and Mos@@ es called all Israel , and said un@@ to them , He@@ ar , O Israel , the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which I speak in your e@@ ars this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
the Lord made not this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with our fa@@ thers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to she@@ w you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the waters ben@@ e@@ ath the ear@@ th :
and remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord TH@@ Y God brought the@@ e out th@@ ence through a m@@ igh@@ ty hand and by a stret@@ ched out arm : therefore the Lord TH@@ Y God comman@@ ded the@@ e to keep the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
honour TH@@ Y father and TH@@ Y mother , as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e ; that TH@@ Y days may be prol@@ on@@ ged , and that it may go well with the@@ e , in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e .
neither s@@ halt th@@ ou desire TH@@ Y neighbour 's wife , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's house , his field , or his man@@ ser@@ vant , or his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , his o@@ x , or his ass , or any thing that is TH@@ Y neighbour 's .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the mid@@ st of the d@@ ark@@ ness , ( for the mountain did bur@@ n with fire , ) that ye came near un@@ to me , even all the heads of your tri@@ bes , and your el@@ ders ;
and ye said , be@@ hold , the Lord our God hat@@ h she@@ wed us his gl@@ ory and his gre@@ at@@ ness , and we have heard his voice out of the mid@@ st of the fire : we have seen this day that God do@@ th talk with man , and he li@@ vet@@ h .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consum@@ e us : if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all f@@ les@@ h , that hat@@ h heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the mid@@ st of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
go th@@ ou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak th@@ ou un@@ to us all that the Lord our God shall speak un@@ to the@@ e ; and we will hear it , and do it .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye sp@@ ake un@@ to me ; and the Lord said un@@ to me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : they have well said all that they have spoken .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
Y@@ e shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hat@@ h comman@@ ded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
Y@@ e shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hat@@ h comman@@ ded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prol@@ ong your days in the land which ye shall poss@@ ess .
now these are the comman@@ d@@ ments , the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which the Lord your God comman@@ ded to te@@ ach you , that ye might do them in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it :
that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test fear the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep all his stat@@ utes and his comman@@ d@@ ments , which I command the@@ e , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y son 's son , all the days of TH@@ Y life ; and that TH@@ Y days may be prol@@ on@@ ged .
hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with the@@ e , and that ye may increase m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly , as the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers hat@@ h promised the@@ e , in the land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , and with all TH@@ Y might .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to TH@@ Y children , and s@@ halt talk of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , and when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a Je@@ al@@ ous God among you ) lest the an@@ ger of the Lord TH@@ Y God be kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and destroy the@@ e from off the face of the ear@@ th .
Y@@ e shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , and his testimon@@ ies , and his stat@@ utes , which he hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with the@@ e , and that th@@ ou may@@ est go in and poss@@ ess the good land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ,
and when TH@@ Y son ask@@ eth the@@ e in time to come , saying , What mean the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which the Lord our God hat@@ h comman@@ ded you ?
then th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to TH@@ Y son , We were P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's bon@@ d@@ men in Egypt ; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand :
and the Lord she@@ wed signs and won@@ ders , great and sor@@ e , upon Egypt , upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and he brought us out from th@@ ence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sw@@ are un@@ to our fa@@ thers .
and the Lord comman@@ ded us to do all these stat@@ utes , to fear the Lord our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
and when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver them before the@@ e ; th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite them , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them ; th@@ ou s@@ halt make no C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , nor she@@ w mer@@ cy un@@ to them :
neither s@@ halt th@@ ou make marri@@ ages with them ; TH@@ Y daughter th@@ ou s@@ halt not give un@@ to his son , nor his daughter s@@ halt th@@ ou take un@@ to TH@@ Y son .
for they will turn away TH@@ Y son from following me , that they may serve other go@@ ds : so will the an@@ ger of the Lord be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and destroy the@@ e su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their al@@ tar@@ s , and break down their images , and cut down their gro@@ ves , and bur@@ n their Gra@@ ven images with fire .
for th@@ ou art an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to be a special people un@@ to himself , above all people that are upon the face of the ear@@ th .
the Lord did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fe@@ west of all people :
but because the Lord lov@@ ed you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn un@@ to your fa@@ thers , hat@@ h the Lord brought you out with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bon@@ d@@ men , from the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt .
know therefore that the Lord TH@@ Y God , he is God , the fa@@ ith@@ ful God , which keep@@ eth C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and mer@@ cy with them that love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments to a thousand generations ;
and re@@ pay@@ eth them that h@@ ate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be S@@ lack to him that ha@@ te@@ th him , he will repay him to his face .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it shall come to pass , if ye he@@ arken to these judg@@ ments , and keep , and do them , that the Lord TH@@ Y God shall keep un@@ to the@@ e the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and the mer@@ cy which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers :
and the Lord will take away from the@@ e all si@@ ck@@ ness , and will put none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which th@@ ou know@@ est , upon the@@ e ; but will lay them upon all them that h@@ ate the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt consum@@ e all the people which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver the@@ e ; th@@ ine eye shall have no p@@ ity upon them : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou serve their go@@ ds ; for that will be a sn@@ are un@@ to the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not be afraid of them : but s@@ halt well remember what the Lord TH@@ Y God did un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and un@@ to all Egypt ;
moreover the Lord TH@@ Y God will send the hor@@ net among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from the@@ e , be destroyed .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will put out those nations before the@@ e by little and little : th@@ ou may@@ est not consum@@ e them at once , lest the be@@ asts of the field increase upon the@@ e .
and he shall deliver their kings into th@@ ine hand , and th@@ ou s@@ halt destroy their name from under heav@@ en : there shall no man be able to stand before the@@ e , until th@@ ou have destroyed them .
all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multi@@ ply , and go in and poss@@ ess the land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also consider in th@@ ine heart , that , as a man ch@@ as@@ ten@@ eth his son , so the Lord TH@@ Y God ch@@ as@@ ten@@ eth the@@ e .
a land of wheat , and bar@@ ley , and v@@ ines , and fi@@ g trees , and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates ; a land of oil olive , and hon@@ ey ;
a land where@@ in th@@ ou s@@ halt eat bread without scar@@ cen@@ ess , th@@ ou s@@ halt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hil@@ ls th@@ ou may@@ est di@@ g br@@ ass .
when th@@ ou h@@ ast e@@ aten and art full , then th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ less the Lord TH@@ Y God for the good land which he hat@@ h given the@@ e .
be@@ w@@ are that th@@ ou forget not the Lord TH@@ Y God , in not keeping his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his judg@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , which I command the@@ e this day :
L@@ est when th@@ ou h@@ ast e@@ aten and art full , and h@@ ast built good@@ ly houses , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in ;
and when TH@@ Y her@@ ds and TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks multi@@ ply , and TH@@ Y silver and TH@@ Y gold is multi@@ p@@ lied , and all that th@@ ou h@@ ast is multi@@ p@@ lied ;
then th@@ ine heart be lifted up , and th@@ ou forget the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
who led the@@ e through that great and ter@@ ri@@ ble w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where@@ in were fi@@ ery Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought the@@ e forth water out of the rock of F@@ lin@@ t ;
who f@@ ed the@@ e in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with man@@ na , which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers knew not , that he might hum@@ ble the@@ e , and that he might prove the@@ e , to do the@@ e good at TH@@ Y latter end ;
but th@@ ou s@@ halt remember the Lord TH@@ Y God : for it is he that gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e power to get wealth , that he may establish his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , as it is this day .
and it shall be , if th@@ ou do at all forget the Lord TH@@ Y God , and walk after other go@@ ds , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall su@@ rely per@@ ish .
as the nations which the Lord destro@@ yet@@ h before your face , so shall ye per@@ ish ; because ye would not be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to the voice of the Lord your God .
a people great and t@@ all , the children of the An@@ ak@@ ims , whom th@@ ou know@@ est , and of whom th@@ ou h@@ ast heard say , Wh@@ o can stand before the children of An@@ ak !
remember , and forget not , how th@@ ou provok@@ ed@@ st the Lord TH@@ Y God to wr@@ ath in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : from the day that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st de@@ part out of the land of Egypt , until ye came un@@ to this place , ye have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against the Lord .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which the Lord made with you , then I abo@@ de in the mount for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the Lord delivered un@@ to me two tables of stone written with the fin@@ ger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the Lord sp@@ ake with you in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , arise , get the@@ e down quickly from hence ; for TH@@ Y people which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of Egypt have cor@@ rupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I comman@@ ded them ; they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten image .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant were in my two hands .
and I looked , and , be@@ hold , ye had sin@@ ned against the Lord your God , and had made you a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had comman@@ ded you .
and I took the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and br@@ ake them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the an@@ ger and hot disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , where@@ with the Lord was wro@@ th against you to destroy you . but the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me at that time also .
thus I fell down before the Lord for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , as I fell down at the first ; because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
I pray@@ ed therefore un@@ to the Lord , and said , O Lord God , destroy not TH@@ Y people and th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed through TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand .
remember TH@@ Y servants , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b ; look not un@@ to the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of this people , nor to their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor to their sin :
L@@ est the land wh@@ ence th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test us out say , Bec@@ ause the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he ha@@ ted them , he hat@@ h brought them out to s@@ lay them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est , and th@@ ou s@@ halt put them in the Ar@@ k .
and I made an Ar@@ k of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and he@@ wed two tables of stone like un@@ to the first , and went up into the mount , having the two tables in mine hand .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments , which the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gave them un@@ to me .
and I turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tables in the Ar@@ k which I had made ; and there they be , as the Lord comman@@ ded me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his stead .
and I stayed in the mount , according to the first time , for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; and the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me at that time also , and the Lord would not destroy the@@ e .
be@@ hold , the heav@@ en and the heav@@ en of heav@@ ens is the Lord 's TH@@ Y God , the ear@@ th also , with all that there@@ in is .
only the Lord had a de@@ light in TH@@ Y fa@@ thers to love them , and he chose their se@@ ed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
for the Lord your God is God of go@@ ds , and Lord of lor@@ ds , a great God , a m@@ igh@@ ty , and a ter@@ ri@@ ble , which regar@@ de@@ th not persons , nor tak@@ eth reward :
he is TH@@ Y praise , and he is TH@@ Y God , that hat@@ h done for the@@ e these great and ter@@ ri@@ ble things , which th@@ ine eyes have seen .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God , and keep his charge , and his stat@@ utes , and his judg@@ ments , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , al@@ way .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of the Lord your God , his gre@@ at@@ ness , his m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and his stret@@ ched out arm ,
and his mir@@ ac@@ les , and his acts , which he did in the mid@@ st of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h the king of Egypt , and un@@ to all his land ;
and what he did un@@ to the army of Egypt , un@@ to their hor@@ ses , and to their char@@ i@@ ots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to over@@ flow them as they pursu@@ ed after you , and how the Lord hat@@ h destroyed them un@@ to this day ;
therefore shall ye keep all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and poss@@ ess the land , w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it ;
and that ye may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers to give un@@ to them and to their se@@ ed , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
for the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est in to poss@@ ess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from wh@@ ence ye came out , where th@@ ou so@@ w@@ ed@@ st TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and water@@ ed@@ st it with TH@@ Y fo@@ ot , as a gar@@ den of her@@ bs :
but the land , w@@ hi@@ ther ye go to poss@@ ess it , is a land of hil@@ ls and val@@ ley@@ s , and drin@@ ket@@ h water of the rain of heav@@ en :
a land which the Lord TH@@ Y God c@@ aret@@ h for : the eyes of the Lord TH@@ Y God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even un@@ to the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that th@@ ou may@@ est gather in TH@@ Y cor@@ n , and TH@@ Y wine , and th@@ ine oil .
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that your heart be not dec@@ e@@ ived , and ye turn aside , and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
and then the Lord 's wr@@ ath be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he shut up the heav@@ en , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye per@@ ish quickly from off the good land which the Lord gi@@ vet@@ h you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l , and bin@@ d them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as fron@@ t@@ lets between your eyes .
and ye shall te@@ ach them your children , speaking of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
for if ye shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep all these comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you , to do them , to love the Lord your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cle@@ ave un@@ to him ;
every place where@@ on the so@@ les of your feet shall tre@@ ad shall be yo@@ urs : from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , even un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall tre@@ ad upon , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to you .
a b@@ les@@ sing , if ye obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day :
and a cur@@ se , if ye will not obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h brought the@@ e in un@@ to the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it , that th@@ ou s@@ halt put the b@@ les@@ sing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se upon mount E@@ bal .
are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun go@@ eth down , in the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , which d@@ well in the champ@@ a@@ ign over against G@@ ilg@@ al , bes@@ ide the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ re@@ h ?
for ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess the land which the Lord your God gi@@ vet@@ h you , and ye shall poss@@ ess it , and d@@ well there@@ in .
these are the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it , all the days that ye live upon the ear@@ th .
Y@@ e shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all the places , where@@ in the nations which ye shall poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , upon the high mountains , and upon the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow their al@@ tar@@ s , and break their pil@@ lars , and bur@@ n their gro@@ ves with fire ; and ye shall he@@ w down the Gra@@ ven images of their go@@ ds , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
but un@@ to the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tri@@ bes to put his name there , even un@@ to his habi@@ tation shall ye seek , and th@@ ither th@@ ou s@@ halt come :
and th@@ ither ye shall bring your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and your ti@@ th@@ es , and he@@ ave offer@@ ings of your hand , and your vows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ lings of your her@@ ds and of your f@@ loc@@ ks :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that ye put your hand un@@ to , ye and your households , where@@ in the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e .
Y@@ e shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is right in his own eyes .
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inher@@ it@@ ance , which the Lord your God gi@@ vet@@ h you .
but when ye go over Jordan , and d@@ well in the land which the Lord your God gi@@ vet@@ h you to inher@@ it , and when he gi@@ vet@@ h you rest from all your enem@@ ies round about , so that ye d@@ well in safety ;
then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to d@@ well there ; th@@ ither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , your ti@@ th@@ es , and the he@@ ave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord :
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of TH@@ Y tri@@ bes , there th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there th@@ ou s@@ halt do all that I command the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u may@@ est not eat within TH@@ Y gates the ti@@ the of TH@@ Y cor@@ n , or of TH@@ Y wine , or of TH@@ Y oil , or the fir@@ st@@ lings of TH@@ Y her@@ ds or of TH@@ Y flock , nor any of TH@@ Y vows which th@@ ou vo@@ west , nor TH@@ Y fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , or he@@ ave offering of th@@ ine hand :
when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall en@@ large TH@@ Y border , as he hat@@ h promised the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt say , I will eat f@@ les@@ h , because TH@@ Y sou@@ l lon@@ get@@ h to eat f@@ les@@ h ; th@@ ou may@@ est eat f@@ les@@ h , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y sou@@ l lus@@ te@@ th after .
if the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen to put his name there be too far from the@@ e , then th@@ ou s@@ halt kill of TH@@ Y her@@ d and of TH@@ Y flock , which the Lord hat@@ h given the@@ e , as I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat in TH@@ Y gates wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y sou@@ l lus@@ te@@ th after .
only be sure that th@@ ou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and th@@ ou may@@ est not eat the life with the f@@ les@@ h .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not eat it ; that it may go well with the@@ e , and with TH@@ Y children after the@@ e , when th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
only TH@@ Y hol@@ y things which th@@ ou h@@ ast , and TH@@ Y vows , th@@ ou s@@ halt take , and go un@@ to the place which the Lord shall choose :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , the f@@ les@@ h and the blood , upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God : and the blood of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be p@@ oured out upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the f@@ les@@ h .
when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall cut off the nations from before the@@ e , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess them , and th@@ ou succe@@ ede@@ st them , and d@@ wel@@ lest in their land ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not do so un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord , which he ha@@ te@@ th , have they done un@@ to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters they have bur@@ n@@ t in the fire to their go@@ ds .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , where@@ of he sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Let us go after other go@@ ds , which th@@ ou h@@ ast not known , and let us serve them ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not he@@ arken un@@ to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for the Lord your God pro@@ vet@@ h you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not consent un@@ to him , nor he@@ arken un@@ to him ; neither shall th@@ ine eye p@@ ity him , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou spar@@ e , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou conce@@ al him :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely kill him ; th@@ ine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hat@@ h sought to th@@ rust the@@ e away from the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought among you ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely sm@@ ite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in , and the c@@ attle there@@ of , with the edge of the s@@ word .
when th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
for th@@ ou art an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and the Lord hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people un@@ to himself , above all the nations that are upon the ear@@ th .
the har@@ t , and the ro@@ e@@ bu@@ ck , and the f@@ allow de@@ er , and the wild go@@ at , and the p@@ y@@ gar@@ g , and the wild o@@ x , and the ch@@ am@@ o@@ is .
and every be@@ ast that par@@ te@@ th the ho@@ of , and cle@@ av@@ eth the cle@@ ft into two cla@@ ws , and che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d among the be@@ asts , that ye shall eat .

then s@@ halt th@@ ou turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in th@@ ine hand , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose :
at the end of three years th@@ ou s@@ halt bring forth all the ti@@ the of th@@ ine increase the same year , and s@@ halt lay it up within TH@@ Y gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every credi@@ tor that len@@ de@@ th ought un@@ to his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the Lord 's release .
of a foreig@@ ner th@@ ou may@@ est exact it again : but that which is th@@ ine with TH@@ Y brother th@@ ine hand shall release ;
for the Lord TH@@ Y God b@@ les@@ set@@ h the@@ e , as he promised the@@ e : and th@@ ou s@@ halt lend un@@ to many nations , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not bor@@ row ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt reign over many nations , but they shall not reign over the@@ e .
if there be among you a poor man of one of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren within any of TH@@ Y gates in TH@@ Y land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not har@@ den th@@ ine heart , nor shut th@@ ine hand from TH@@ Y poor brother :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt open th@@ ine hand wide un@@ to him , and s@@ halt su@@ rely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wan@@ te@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely give him , and th@@ ine heart shall not be gri@@ ev@@ ed when th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est un@@ to him : because that for this thing the Lord TH@@ Y God shall b@@ less the@@ e in all TH@@ Y works , and in all that th@@ ou p@@ ut@@ test th@@ ine hand un@@ to .
for the poor shall never ce@@ ase out of the land : therefore I command the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt open th@@ ine hand wide un@@ to TH@@ Y brother , to TH@@ Y poor , and to TH@@ Y ne@@ edy , in TH@@ Y land .
and if TH@@ Y brother , an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w man , or an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w woman , be sold un@@ to the@@ e , and serve the@@ e six years ; then in the seventh year th@@ ou s@@ halt let him go free from the@@ e .
and when th@@ ou sen@@ dest him out free from the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not let him go away empty :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of TH@@ Y flock , and out of TH@@ Y floor , and out of TH@@ Y win@@ e@@ press : of that where@@ with the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to him .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in the land of Egypt , and the Lord TH@@ Y God re@@ deemed the@@ e : therefore I command the@@ e this thing to day .
and it shall be , if he say un@@ to the@@ e , I will not go away from the@@ e ; because he lov@@ eth the@@ e and th@@ ine house , because he is well with the@@ e ;
then th@@ ou s@@ halt take an a@@ ul , and th@@ rust it through his e@@ ar un@@ to the door , and he shall be TH@@ Y ser@@ vant for ever . and also un@@ to TH@@ Y ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant th@@ ou s@@ halt do likewise .
all the fir@@ st@@ ling mal@@ es that come of TH@@ Y her@@ d and of TH@@ Y flock th@@ ou s@@ halt sanc@@ ti@@ fy un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : th@@ ou s@@ halt do no work with the fir@@ st@@ ling of TH@@ Y bul@@ lock , nor s@@ hear the fir@@ st@@ ling of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat it before the Lord TH@@ Y God year by year in the place which the Lord shall choose , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y household .
and if there be any ble@@ mis@@ h there@@ in , as if it be la@@ me , or b@@ lin@@ d , or have any ill ble@@ mis@@ h , th@@ ou s@@ halt not sacrifice it un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
observe the month of A@@ bi@@ b , and keep the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : for in the month of A@@ bi@@ b the Lord TH@@ Y God brought the@@ e forth out of Egypt by night .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore sacrifice the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and there shall be no le@@ av@@ ened bread seen with the@@ e in all TH@@ Y coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the f@@ les@@ h , which th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed@@ st the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose to place his name in , there th@@ ou s@@ halt sacrifice the pass@@ over at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st forth out of Egypt .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : and th@@ ou s@@ halt turn in the morning , and go un@@ to TH@@ Y ten@@ ts .
six days th@@ ou s@@ halt eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a so@@ lem@@ n assembly to the Lord TH@@ Y God : th@@ ou s@@ halt do no work there@@ in .
seven weeks s@@ halt th@@ ou number un@@ to the@@ e : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as th@@ ou begin@@ n@@ est to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the cor@@ n .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the feast of weeks un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God with a tri@@ bute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of th@@ ine hand , which th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , according as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y feast , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y daughter , and TH@@ Y man@@ ser@@ vant , and TH@@ Y ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , and the Lev@@ ite , the st@@ ran@@ ger , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the wi@@ dow , that are within TH@@ Y gates .
seven days s@@ halt th@@ ou keep a so@@ lem@@ n feast un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which the Lord shall choose : because the Lord TH@@ Y God shall b@@ less the@@ e in all th@@ ine increase , and in all the works of th@@ ine hands , therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely re@@ jo@@ ice .
every man shall give as he is able , according to the b@@ les@@ sing of the Lord TH@@ Y God which he hat@@ h given the@@ e .
judges and officers s@@ halt th@@ ou make the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , throughout TH@@ Y tri@@ bes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not w@@ rest judgment ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not respect persons , neither take a gift : for a gift do@@ th b@@ lin@@ d the eyes of the wise , and per@@ ver@@ t the words of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not plant the@@ e a gro@@ ve of any trees near un@@ to the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou s@@ halt make the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not sacrifice un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God any bul@@ lock , or she@@ ep , where@@ in is ble@@ mis@@ h , or any ev@@ il@@ fav@@ ou@@ red@@ ness : for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
if there be found among you , within any of TH@@ Y gates which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , man or woman , that hat@@ h w@@ rought w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord TH@@ Y God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and hat@@ h gone and served other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heav@@ en , which I have not comman@@ ded ;
and it be told the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of it , and inqu@@ ired dil@@ ig@@ ently , and , be@@ hold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought in Israel :
then s@@ halt th@@ ou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that w@@ ic@@ ked thing , un@@ to TH@@ Y gates , even that man or that woman , and s@@ halt stone them with stones , ti@@ ll they die .
at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is wor@@ thy of death be put to death ; but at the m@@ outh of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and after@@ ward the hands of all the people . so th@@ ou s@@ halt put the ev@@ il away from among you .
if there arise a matter too hard for the@@ e in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stro@@ ke and stro@@ ke , being matters of controversy within TH@@ Y gates : then s@@ halt th@@ ou arise , and get the@@ e up into the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose ;
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come un@@ to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and un@@ to the judge that shall be in those days , and inqu@@ ire ; and they shall she@@ w the@@ e the sentence of judgment :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall she@@ w the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt observe to do according to all that they inform the@@ e :
according to the sentence of the law which they shall te@@ ach the@@ e , and according to the judgment which they shall tell the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt do : th@@ ou s@@ halt not decline from the sentence which they shall she@@ w the@@ e , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , and will not he@@ arken un@@ to the pri@@ est that stan@@ de@@ th to minister there before the Lord TH@@ Y God , or un@@ to the judge , even that man shall die : and th@@ ou s@@ halt put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
when th@@ ou art come un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and s@@ halt poss@@ ess it , and s@@ halt d@@ well there@@ in , and s@@ halt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt in any wise set him king over the@@ e , whom the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : one from among TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren s@@ halt th@@ ou set king over the@@ e : th@@ ou may@@ est not set a st@@ ran@@ ger over the@@ e , which is not TH@@ Y brother .
but he shall not multi@@ ply hor@@ ses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multi@@ ply hor@@ ses : for@@ as@@ much as the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall hen@@ ce@@ forth return no more that way .
and it shall be , when he sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , that he shall write him a cop@@ y of this law in a book out of that which is before the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read there@@ in all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this law and these stat@@ utes , to do them :
that his heart be not lifted up above his bre@@ th@@ ren , and that he turn not aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he , and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the tri@@ be of L@@ evi , shall have no part nor inher@@ it@@ ance with Israel : they shall eat the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , and his inher@@ it@@ ance .
and this shall be the pri@@ est 's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep ; and they shall give un@@ to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
the fir@@ st@@ fruit also of TH@@ Y cor@@ n , of TH@@ Y wine , and of th@@ ine oil , and the first of the F@@ le@@ ece of TH@@ Y she@@ ep , s@@ halt th@@ ou give him .
and if a Lev@@ ite come from any of TH@@ Y gates out of all Israel , where he so@@ jour@@ ned , and come with all the desire of his mind un@@ to the place which the Lord shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God , as all his bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes do , which stand there before the Lord .
when th@@ ou art come into the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not learn to do after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of those nations .
for all that do these things are an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord : and because of these ab@@ omin@@ ations the Lord TH@@ Y God do@@ th drive them out from before the@@ e .
for these nations , which th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess , hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to observers of times , and un@@ to di@@ vin@@ ers : but as for the@@ e , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h not suffered the@@ e so to do .
the Lord TH@@ Y God will raise up un@@ to the@@ e a Pro@@ phe@@ t from the mid@@ st of the@@ e , of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; un@@ to him ye shall he@@ arken ;
according to all that th@@ ou desi@@ red@@ st of the Lord TH@@ Y God in Ho@@ re@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
I will raise them up a Pro@@ phe@@ t from among their bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to the@@ e , and will put my words in his m@@ outh ; and he shall speak un@@ to them all that I shall command him .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not he@@ arken un@@ to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the pro@@ phe@@ t , which shall pres@@ ume to speak a word in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other go@@ ds , even that pro@@ phe@@ t shall die .
when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h cut off the nations , whose land the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and th@@ ou succe@@ ede@@ st them , and d@@ wel@@ lest in their cities , and in their houses ;
but if any man h@@ ate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and sm@@ ite him mort@@ ally that he die , and fle@@ eth into one of these cities :
Th@@ ine eye shall not p@@ ity him , but th@@ ou s@@ halt put away the guil@@ t of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not remove TH@@ Y neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou s@@ halt inher@@ it in the land that the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sin@@ net@@ h : at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or at the m@@ outh of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the Lord , before the pri@@ ests and the judges , which shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make dil@@ ig@@ ent In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition : and , be@@ hold , if the witness be a false witness , and hat@@ h testified fal@@ sely against his brother ;
then shall ye do un@@ to him , as he had thought to have done un@@ to his brother : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put the ev@@ il away from among you .
when th@@ ou go@@ est out to battle against th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and se@@ est hor@@ ses , and char@@ i@@ ots , and a people more than th@@ ou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord TH@@ Y God is with the@@ e , which brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall be , when ye are come n@@ igh un@@ to the battle , that the pri@@ est shall approach and speak un@@ to the people ,
and shall say un@@ to them , He@@ ar , O Israel , ye approach this day un@@ to battle against your enem@@ ies : let not your hear@@ ts fa@@ int , fear not , and do not tre@@ m@@ ble , neither be ye ter@@ ri@@ fied because of them ;
and the officers shall speak un@@ to the people , saying , What man is there that hat@@ h built a new house , and hat@@ h not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedic@@ ate it .
and what man is he that hat@@ h plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and hat@@ h not yet e@@ aten of it ? let him also go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed a wife , and hat@@ h not taken her ? let him go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further un@@ to the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fear@@ ful and fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return un@@ to his house , lest his bre@@ th@@ ren 's heart fa@@ int as well as his heart .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking un@@ to the people , that they shall make cap@@ tains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make the@@ e answer of peace , and open un@@ to the@@ e , then it shall be , that all the people that is found there@@ in shall be tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to the@@ e , and they shall serve the@@ e .
and when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h delivered it into th@@ ine hands , th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite every male there@@ of with the edge of the s@@ word :
but the women , and the little ones , and the c@@ attle , and all that is in the city , even all the sp@@ oil there@@ of , s@@ halt th@@ ou take un@@ to th@@ y@@ self ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the sp@@ oil of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e .
thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do un@@ to all the cities which are very far off from the@@ e , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but th@@ ou s@@ halt ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them ; name@@ ly , the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites ; as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e :
that they te@@ ach you not to do after all their ab@@ omin@@ ations , which they have done un@@ to their go@@ ds ; so should ye sin against the Lord your God .
if one be found sla@@ in in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hat@@ h sla@@ in him :
then TH@@ Y el@@ ders and TH@@ Y judges shall come forth , and they shall measure un@@ to the cities which are round about him that is sla@@ in :
and it shall be , that the city which is next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take an he@@ if@@ er , which hat@@ h not been w@@ rought with , and which hat@@ h not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
and the el@@ ders of that city shall bring down the he@@ if@@ er un@@ to a roug@@ h val@@ ley , which is neither ear@@ ed nor so@@ wn , and shall strike off the he@@ if@@ er 's nec@@ k there in the val@@ ley :
and the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi shall come near ; for them the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen to minister un@@ to him , and to b@@ less in the name of the Lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stro@@ ke be tried :
and all the el@@ ders of that city , that are next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , shall was@@ h their hands over the he@@ if@@ er that is be@@ headed in the val@@ ley :
be mer@@ ci@@ ful , O Lord , un@@ to TH@@ Y people Israel , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed , and lay not innocent blood un@@ to TH@@ Y people of Israel 's charge . and the blood shall be for@@ given them .
so s@@ halt th@@ ou put away the guil@@ t of innocent blood from among you , when th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
when th@@ ou go@@ est forth to war against th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h delivered them into th@@ ine hands , and th@@ ou h@@ ast taken them cap@@ tive ,
and se@@ est among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and h@@ ast a desire un@@ to her , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest have her to TH@@ Y wife ;
then th@@ ou s@@ halt bring her home to th@@ ine house ; and she shall s@@ have her head , and par@@ e her n@@ ails ;
and it shall be , if th@@ ou have no de@@ light in her , then th@@ ou s@@ halt let her go w@@ hi@@ ther she will ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not sell her at all for money , th@@ ou s@@ halt not make mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of her , because th@@ ou h@@ ast hum@@ b@@ led her .
if a man have two wi@@ ves , one bel@@ ov@@ ed , and another ha@@ ted , and they have born him children , both the bel@@ ov@@ ed and the ha@@ ted ; and if the fir@@ st@@ born son be hers that was ha@@ ted :
then it shall be , when he mak@@ eth his sons to inher@@ it that which he hat@@ h , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , which is indeed the fir@@ st@@ born :
if a man have a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous son , which will not obe@@ y the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have ch@@ as@@ tened him , will not he@@ arken un@@ to them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out un@@ to the el@@ ders of his city , and un@@ to the gate of his place ;
and they shall say un@@ to the el@@ ders of his city , This our son is st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous , he will not obe@@ y our voice ; he is a gl@@ ut@@ ton , and a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d .
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put ev@@ il away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have committed a sin wor@@ thy of death , and he be to be put to death , and th@@ ou han@@ g him on a tree :
in like manner s@@ halt th@@ ou do with his ass ; and so s@@ halt th@@ ou do with his ra@@ im@@ ent ; and with all lost thing of TH@@ Y brother 's , which he hat@@ h lost , and th@@ ou h@@ ast found , s@@ halt th@@ ou do likewise : th@@ ou may@@ est not hide th@@ y@@ self .
the woman shall not wear that which per@@ tain@@ eth un@@ to a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's gar@@ ment : for all that do so are ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
if a bird 's n@@ est chance to be before the@@ e in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eg@@ gs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eg@@ gs , th@@ ou s@@ halt not take the dam with the young :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to the@@ e ; that it may be well with the@@ e , and that th@@ ou may@@ est prol@@ ong TH@@ Y days .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not so@@ w TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard with di@@ vers se@@ eds : lest the fruit of TH@@ Y se@@ ed which th@@ ou h@@ ast so@@ wn , and the fruit of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , be def@@ iled .
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an ev@@ il name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a ma@@ id :
then shall the father of the dam@@ sel , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the dam@@ sel 's vir@@ gin@@ ity un@@ to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate :
and they shall am@@ erce him in an hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and give them un@@ to the father of the dam@@ sel , because he hat@@ h brought up an ev@@ il name upon a vir@@ gin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put away ev@@ il from Israel .
but if a man find a bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed dam@@ sel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her : then the man only that lay with her shall die :
but un@@ to the dam@@ sel th@@ ou s@@ halt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
if a man find a dam@@ sel that is a vir@@ gin , which is not bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man that lay with her shall give un@@ to the dam@@ sel 's father fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hat@@ h hum@@ b@@ led her , he may not put her away all his days .
he that is wounded in the stones , or hat@@ h his priv@@ y member cut off , shall not enter into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord .
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against the@@ e Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or of P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se the@@ e .
nevertheless the Lord TH@@ Y God would not he@@ arken un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am ; but the Lord TH@@ Y God turned the cur@@ se into a b@@ les@@ sing un@@ to the@@ e , because the Lord TH@@ Y God lov@@ ed the@@ e .
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that chan@@ c@@ eth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening co@@ me@@ th on , he shall was@@ h himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have a p@@ add@@ le upon TH@@ Y weapon ; and it shall be , when th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t ease th@@ y@@ self abroad , th@@ ou s@@ halt di@@ g there@@ with , and s@@ halt turn back and cover that which co@@ me@@ th from the@@ e :
for the Lord TH@@ Y God walk@@ eth in the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y camp , to deliver the@@ e , and to give up th@@ ine enem@@ ies before the@@ e ; therefore shall TH@@ Y camp be hol@@ y : that he see no un@@ clean thing in the@@ e , and turn away from the@@ e .
he shall d@@ well with the@@ e , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of TH@@ Y gates , where it lik@@ eth him best : th@@ ou s@@ halt not op@@ press him .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not bring the h@@ ire of a wh@@ ore , or the price of a do@@ g , into the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
un@@ to a st@@ ran@@ ger th@@ ou may@@ est lend upon us@@ ury ; but un@@ to TH@@ Y brother th@@ ou s@@ halt not lend upon us@@ ury : that the Lord TH@@ Y God may b@@ less the@@ e in all that th@@ ou set@@ test th@@ ine hand to in the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
when th@@ ou s@@ halt vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , th@@ ou s@@ halt not S@@ lack to pay it : for the Lord TH@@ Y God will su@@ rely require it of the@@ e ; and it would be sin in the@@ e .
that which is gone out of TH@@ Y li@@ ps th@@ ou s@@ halt keep and perform ; even a fre@@ e@@ will offering , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised with TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into TH@@ Y neighbour 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then th@@ ou may@@ est eat grap@@ es TH@@ Y fill at th@@ ine own pleas@@ ure ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not put any in TH@@ Y ves@@ sel .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into the standing cor@@ n of TH@@ Y neighbour , then th@@ ou may@@ est p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars with th@@ ine hand ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not move a si@@ ck@@ le un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour 's standing cor@@ n .
when a man hat@@ h taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hat@@ h found some un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess in her : then let him write her a bill of div@@ or@@ cement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
and when she is depar@@ ted out of his house , she may go and be another man 's wife .
and if the latter husband h@@ ate her , and write her a bill of div@@ or@@ cement , and gi@@ vet@@ h it in her hand , and sen@@ de@@ th her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is def@@ iled ; for that is ab@@ omin@@ ation before the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not cause the land to sin , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
when a man hat@@ h taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall che@@ er up his wife which he hat@@ h taken .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his bre@@ th@@ ren of the children of Israel , and mak@@ eth mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of him , or sel@@ le@@ th him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt put ev@@ il away from among you .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that th@@ ou observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so ye shall observe to do .
remember what the Lord TH@@ Y God did un@@ to Mi@@ ri@@ am by the way , after that ye were come forth out of Egypt .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt stand abroad , and the man to whom th@@ ou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad un@@ to the@@ e .
in any case th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver him the pledge again when the sun go@@ eth down , that he may sle@@ ep in his own ra@@ im@@ ent , and b@@ less the@@ e : and it shall be righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to the@@ e before the Lord TH@@ Y God .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not op@@ press an hired ser@@ vant that is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , or of TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ gers that are in TH@@ Y land within TH@@ Y gates :
at his day th@@ ou s@@ halt give him his h@@ ire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and set@@ te@@ th his heart upon it : lest he cry against the@@ e un@@ to the Lord , and it be sin un@@ to the@@ e .
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
but th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in Egypt , and the Lord TH@@ Y God re@@ deemed the@@ e th@@ ence : therefore I command the@@ e to do this thing .
when th@@ ou gather@@ est the grap@@ es of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , th@@ ou s@@ halt not g@@ le@@ an it after@@ ward : it shall be for the st@@ ran@@ ger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a bon@@ d@@ man in the land of Egypt : therefore I command the@@ e to do this thing .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then TH@@ Y brother should seem v@@ ile un@@ to the@@ e .
and it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born which she be@@ aret@@ h shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the el@@ ders of his city shall call him , and speak un@@ to him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one dra@@ w@@ eth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that sm@@ ite@@ th him , and p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth her hand , and tak@@ eth him by the secre@@ ts :
but th@@ ou s@@ halt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure s@@ halt th@@ ou have : that TH@@ Y days may be leng@@ th@@ ened in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e .
how he met the@@ e by the way , and smo@@ te the hin@@ d@@ most of the@@ e , even all that were fe@@ e@@ ble behind the@@ e , when th@@ ou w@@ ast fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he fear@@ ed not God .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou art come in un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance , and poss@@ ess@@ est it , and d@@ wel@@ lest there@@ in ;
that th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the first of all the fruit of the ear@@ th , which th@@ ou s@@ halt bring of TH@@ Y land that the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and s@@ halt put it in a bas@@ ket , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose to place his name there .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt go un@@ to the pri@@ est that shall be in those days , and say un@@ to him , I prof@@ ess this day un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , that I am come un@@ to the country which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to our fa@@ thers for to give us .
and the pri@@ est shall take the bas@@ ket out of th@@ ine hand , and set it down before the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
and when we cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord God of our fa@@ thers , the Lord heard our voice , and looked on our aff@@ li@@ ction , and our labour , and our op@@ pression :
and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great ter@@ ri@@ b@@ len@@ ess , and with signs , and with won@@ ders :
and he hat@@ h brought us into this place , and hat@@ h given us this land , even a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
and now , be@@ hold , I have brought the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of the land , which th@@ ou , O Lord , h@@ ast given me . and th@@ ou s@@ halt set it before the Lord TH@@ Y God , and worship before the Lord TH@@ Y God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in every good thing which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given un@@ to the@@ e , and un@@ to th@@ ine house , th@@ ou , and the Lev@@ ite , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that is among you .

this day the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h comman@@ ded the@@ e to do these stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments : th@@ ou s@@ halt therefore keep and do them with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast av@@ ou@@ ched the Lord this day to be TH@@ Y God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his judg@@ ments , and to he@@ arken un@@ to his voice :
and the Lord hat@@ h av@@ ou@@ ched the@@ e this day to be his pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people , as he hat@@ h promised the@@ e , and that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest keep all his comman@@ d@@ ments ;
and to make the@@ e high above all nations which he hat@@ h made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that th@@ ou may@@ est be an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , as he hat@@ h spoken .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt set the@@ e up great stones , and pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount E@@ bal , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister .
and there s@@ halt th@@ ou build an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , an alt@@ ar of stones : th@@ ou s@@ halt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt build the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God of whole stones : and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore obe@@ y the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and do his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes , which I command the@@ e this day .
and it shall come to pass , if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to observe and to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day , that the Lord TH@@ Y God will set the@@ e on high above all nations of the ear@@ th :
and all these b@@ les@@ s@@ ings shall come on the@@ e , and over@@ take the@@ e , if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
b@@ les@@ sed shall be the fruit of TH@@ Y body , and the fruit of TH@@ Y ground , and the fruit of TH@@ Y c@@ attle , the increase of TH@@ Y k@@ ine , and the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
the Lord shall cause th@@ ine enem@@ ies that rise up against the@@ e to be s@@ mit@@ ten before TH@@ Y face : they shall come out against the@@ e one way , and flee before the@@ e seven ways .
the Lord shall command the b@@ les@@ sing upon the@@ e in TH@@ Y sto@@ re@@ houses , and in all that th@@ ou set@@ test th@@ ine hand un@@ to ; and he shall b@@ less the@@ e in the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e .
the Lord shall establish the@@ e an hol@@ y people un@@ to himself , as he hat@@ h sworn un@@ to the@@ e , if th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and walk in his ways .
and all people of the ear@@ th shall see that th@@ ou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go aside from any of the words which I command the@@ e this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other go@@ ds to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which I command the@@ e this day ; that all these cur@@ ses shall come upon the@@ e , and over@@ take the@@ e :
Cur@@ sed shall be the fruit of TH@@ Y body , and the fruit of TH@@ Y land , the increase of TH@@ Y k@@ ine , and the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
the Lord shall make the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce cle@@ ave un@@ to the@@ e , until he have consu@@ med the@@ e from off the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e with a consumption , and with a f@@ ever , and with an inf@@ lam@@ mation , and with an extreme burning , and with the s@@ word , and with b@@ lasting , and with mil@@ dew ; and they shall pursue the@@ e until th@@ ou per@@ ish .
and TH@@ Y heav@@ en that is over TH@@ Y head shall be br@@ ass , and the ear@@ th that is under the@@ e shall be iron .
the Lord shall make the rain of TH@@ Y land pow@@ der and d@@ ust : from heav@@ en shall it come down upon the@@ e , until th@@ ou be destroyed .
and TH@@ Y car@@ case shall be meat un@@ to all fo@@ w@@ ls of the air , and un@@ to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th , and no man shall fra@@ y them away .
the Lord will sm@@ ite the@@ e with the bot@@ ch of Egypt , and with the emer@@ ods , and with the sc@@ a@@ b , and with the it@@ ch , where@@ of th@@ ou can@@ st not be he@@ aled .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt gro@@ pe at no@@ on@@ day , as the b@@ lin@@ d gro@@ pet@@ h in d@@ ark@@ ness , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not prosp@@ er in TH@@ Y ways : and th@@ ou s@@ halt be only op@@ pressed and sp@@ o@@ iled ever@@ more , and no man shall save the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : th@@ ou s@@ halt build an house , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not d@@ well there@@ in : th@@ ou s@@ halt plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and s@@ halt not gather the grap@@ es there@@ of .
Th@@ ine o@@ x shall be sla@@ in before th@@ ine eyes , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not eat there@@ of : th@@ ine ass shall be viol@@ ently taken away from before TH@@ Y face , and shall not be restored to the@@ e : TH@@ Y she@@ ep shall be given un@@ to th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and th@@ ou s@@ halt have none to rescue them .
TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given un@@ to another people , and th@@ ine eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in th@@ ine hand .
the fruit of TH@@ Y land , and all TH@@ Y la@@ bour@@ s , shall a nation which th@@ ou know@@ est not eat up ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be only op@@ pressed and cr@@ us@@ hed al@@ way :
so that th@@ ou s@@ halt be ma@@ d for the sight of th@@ ine eyes which th@@ ou s@@ halt see .
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bot@@ ch that can@@ not be he@@ aled , from the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot un@@ to the top of TH@@ Y head .
the Lord shall bring the@@ e , and TH@@ Y king which th@@ ou s@@ halt set over the@@ e , un@@ to a nation which neither th@@ ou nor TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have known ; and there s@@ halt th@@ ou serve other go@@ ds , wood and stone .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt have olive trees throughout all TH@@ Y co@@ asts , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not ano@@ int th@@ y@@ self with the oil ; for th@@ ine olive shall cast his fruit .
because th@@ ou serv@@ ed@@ st not the Lord TH@@ Y God with jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ness , and with gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , for the ab@@ und@@ ance of all things ;
and he shall bes@@ i@@ ege the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates , until TH@@ Y high and f@@ enced walls come down , where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ ted@@ st , throughout all TH@@ Y land : and he shall bes@@ i@@ ege the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates throughout all TH@@ Y land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the fruit of th@@ ine own body , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sons and of TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e , in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress the@@ e :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the f@@ les@@ h of his children whom he shall eat : because he hat@@ h nothing left him in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates .
if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that th@@ ou may@@ est fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , the Lord TH@@ Y God ;
then the Lord will make TH@@ Y plagu@@ es won@@ der@@ ful , and the plagu@@ es of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , even great plagu@@ es , and of long continu@@ ance , and sor@@ e si@@ ck@@ nesses , and of long continu@@ ance .
moreover he will bring upon the@@ e all the diseases of Egypt , which th@@ ou w@@ ast afraid of ; and they shall cle@@ ave un@@ to the@@ e .
also every si@@ ck@@ ness , and every pla@@ gue , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the Lord bring upon the@@ e , until th@@ ou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heav@@ en for multi@@ tude ; because th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
and it shall come to pass , that as the Lord re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over you to do you good , and to multi@@ ply you ; so the Lord will re@@ jo@@ ice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to n@@ ought ; and ye shall be p@@ lu@@ cked from off the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
and the Lord shall sc@@ at@@ ter the@@ e among all people , from the one end of the ear@@ th even un@@ to the other ; and there th@@ ou s@@ halt serve other go@@ ds , which neither th@@ ou nor TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have known , even wood and stone .
and among these nations s@@ halt th@@ ou find no ease , neither shall the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot have rest : but the Lord shall give the@@ e there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and sor@@ row of mind :
and TH@@ Y life shall han@@ g in doubt before the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt fear day and night , and s@@ halt have none assur@@ ance of TH@@ Y life :
in the morning th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Wo@@ uld God it were even ! and at even th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Wo@@ uld God it were morning ! for the fear of th@@ ine heart where@@ with th@@ ou s@@ halt fear , and for the sight of th@@ ine eyes which th@@ ou s@@ halt see .
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , bes@@ ide the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
and Mos@@ es called un@@ to all Israel , and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and un@@ to all his servants , and un@@ to all his land ;
and I have led you for@@ ty years in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : your clo@@ th@@ es are not wa@@ x@@ en old upon you , and TH@@ Y sho@@ e is not wa@@ x@@ en old upon TH@@ Y fo@@ ot .
and when ye came un@@ to this place , S@@ ih@@ on the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an , came out against us un@@ to battle , and we smo@@ te them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and to the G@@ adi@@ tes , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest enter into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the Lord TH@@ Y God , and into his oath , which the Lord TH@@ Y God mak@@ eth with the@@ e this day :
that he may establish the@@ e to day for a people un@@ to himself , and that he may be un@@ to the@@ e a God , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , and as he hat@@ h sworn un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b .
and the Lord shall separate him un@@ to ev@@ il out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that are written in this book of the law :
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagu@@ es of that land , and the si@@ ck@@ nesses which the Lord hat@@ h laid upon it ;
then men shall say , Bec@@ ause they have for@@ sak@@ en the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and the Lord rooted them out of their land in an@@ ger , and in wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon the@@ e , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , which I have set before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt call them to mind among all the nations , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h driven the@@ e ,
and s@@ halt return un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and s@@ halt obe@@ y his voice according to all that I command the@@ e this day , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y children , with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l ;
that then the Lord TH@@ Y God will turn TH@@ Y cap@@ tivity , and have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e , and will return and gather the@@ e from all the nations , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered the@@ e .
if any of th@@ ine be driven out un@@ to the out@@ most parts of heav@@ en , from th@@ ence will the Lord TH@@ Y God gather the@@ e , and from th@@ ence will he f@@ et@@ ch the@@ e :
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will bring the@@ e into the land which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers poss@@ essed , and th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess it ; and he will do the@@ e good , and multi@@ ply the@@ e above TH@@ Y fa@@ thers .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will circum@@ c@@ ise th@@ ine heart , and the heart of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , to love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , that th@@ ou may@@ est live .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which are written in this book of the law , and if th@@ ou turn un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
it is not in heav@@ en , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , Wh@@ o shall go up for us to heav@@ en , and bring it un@@ to us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
neither is it beyond the sea , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , Wh@@ o shall go over the sea for us , and bring it un@@ to us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word is very n@@ igh un@@ to the@@ e , in TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and in TH@@ Y heart , that th@@ ou may@@ est do it .
but if th@@ ine heart turn away , so that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not hear , but s@@ halt be drawn away , and worship other go@@ ds , and serve them ;
I den@@ oun@@ ce un@@ to you this day , that ye shall su@@ rely per@@ ish , and that ye shall not prol@@ ong your days upon the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou pass@@ est over Jordan to go to poss@@ ess it .
and he said un@@ to them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to me , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord TH@@ Y God , he will go over before the@@ e , and he will destroy these nations from before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess them : and Jos@@ hua , he shall go over before the@@ e , as the Lord hat@@ h said .
and the Lord shall do un@@ to them as he did to S@@ ih@@ on and to O@@ g , kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and un@@ to the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and the Lord shall give them up before your face , that ye may do un@@ to them according un@@ to all the comman@@ d@@ ments which I have comman@@ ded you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the Lord TH@@ Y God , he it is that do@@ th go with the@@ e ; he will not fail the@@ e , nor for@@ sake the@@ e .
and the Lord , he it is that do@@ th go before the@@ e ; he will be with the@@ e , he will not fail the@@ e , neither for@@ sake the@@ e : fear not , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
and Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it un@@ to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and un@@ to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
and Mos@@ es comman@@ ded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the so@@ lem@@ n@@ ity of the year of release , in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which he shall choose , th@@ ou s@@ halt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ ger that is within TH@@ Y gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and that their children , which have not known any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the Lord your God , as long as ye live in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go over Jordan to poss@@ ess it .
and the Lord appeared in the tab@@ ern@@ acle in a pil@@ lar of a cl@@ oud : and the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud stood over the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I will su@@ rely hide my face in that day for all the ev@@ ils which they shall have w@@ rought , in that they are turned un@@ to other go@@ ds .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and te@@ ach it the children of Israel : put it in their m@@ ou@@ ths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers , that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey ; and they shall have e@@ aten and filled themselves , and wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at ; then will they turn un@@ to other go@@ ds , and serve them , and prov@@ oke me , and break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and he gave Jos@@ hua the son of nun a charge , and said , Be strong and of a good courage : for th@@ ou s@@ halt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to them : and I will be with the@@ e .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , that it may be there for a witness against the@@ e .
for I know TH@@ Y rebel@@ lion , and TH@@ Y sti@@ ff nec@@ k : be@@ hold , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against the Lord ; and how much more after my death ?
gather un@@ to me all the el@@ ders of your tri@@ bes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their e@@ ars , and call heav@@ en and ear@@ th to record against them .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel the words of this song , until they were ended .
my doc@@ tr@@ ine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall dis@@ til as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender her@@ b , and as the sho@@ wers upon the gr@@ ass :
he is the Rock , his work is perfect : for all his ways are judgment : a God of truth and without in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , just and right is he .
remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations : ask TH@@ Y father , and he will she@@ w the@@ e ; TH@@ Y el@@ ders , and they will tell the@@ e .
when the most High divided to the nations their inher@@ it@@ ance , when he separated the sons of A@@ dam , he set the bo@@ unds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
he found him in a de@@ sert land , and in the waste ho@@ w@@ ling w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; he led him about , he instruc@@ ted him , he kept him as the app@@ le of his eye .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , and oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
but J@@ es@@ hur@@ un wa@@ xed f@@ at , and kicked : th@@ ou art wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at , th@@ ou art grown th@@ ick , th@@ ou art covered with fat@@ ness ; then he for@@ so@@ ok God which made him , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed the Rock of his sal@@ vation .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very fro@@ ward generation , children in whom is no faith .
they have moved me to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities : and I will move them to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with those which are not a people ; I will prov@@ oke them to an@@ ger with a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation .
for a fire is kin@@ d@@ led in mine an@@ ger , and shall bur@@ n un@@ to the lowest hell , and shall consum@@ e the ear@@ th with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
they shall be bur@@ n@@ t with hunger , and dev@@ oured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction : I will also send the te@@ eth of be@@ asts upon them , with the po@@ ison of Ser@@ pen@@ ts of the d@@ ust .
I said , I would sc@@ at@@ ter them into cor@@ ners , I would make the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of them to ce@@ ase from among men :
for their v@@ ine is of the v@@ ine of So@@ dom , and of the fields of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h : their grap@@ es are grap@@ es of g@@ all , their clu@@ sters are bitter :
to me belon@@ get@@ h ven@@ ge@@ ance , and re@@ comp@@ ence ; their fo@@ ot shall sli@@ de in due time : for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make has@@ te .
for the Lord shall judge his people , and rep@@ ent himself for his servants , when he se@@ eth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
if I wh@@ et my g@@ lit@@ tering s@@ word , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to mine enem@@ ies , and will reward them that h@@ ate me .
I will make mine ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood , and my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h ; and that with the blood of the sla@@ in and of the cap@@ tives , from the beginning of reven@@ ges upon the enemy .
re@@ jo@@ ice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will av@@ en@@ ge the blood of his servants , and will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to his ad@@ vers@@ aries , and will be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to his land , and to his people .
and Mos@@ es came and sp@@ ake all the words of this song in the e@@ ars of the people , he , and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of nun .
for it is not a v@@ ain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prol@@ ong your days in the land , w@@ hi@@ ther ye go over Jordan to poss@@ ess it .
get the@@ e up into this mountain A@@ bar@@ im , un@@ to mount N@@ eb@@ o , which is in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and be@@ hold the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give un@@ to the children of Israel for a possession :
and die in the mount w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est up , and be gathered un@@ to TH@@ Y people ; as Aaron TH@@ Y brother died in mount H@@ or , and was gathered un@@ to his people :
because ye t@@ res@@ passed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because ye sanc@@ ti@@ fied me not in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
and this is the b@@ les@@ sing , where@@ with Mos@@ es the man of God b@@ les@@ sed the children of Israel before his death .
Ye@@ a , he lov@@ ed the people ; all his sa@@ ints are in TH@@ Y hand : and they sat down at TH@@ Y feet ; every one shall receive of TH@@ Y words .
who said un@@ to his father and to his mother , I have not seen him ; neither did he acknowledge his bre@@ th@@ ren , nor knew his own children : for they have observed TH@@ Y word , and kept TH@@ Y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and of Joseph he said , b@@ les@@ sed of the Lord be his land , for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of heav@@ en , for the dew , and for the deep that cou@@ ch@@ eth ben@@ e@@ ath ,
and for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of the ear@@ th and ful@@ ness there@@ of , and for the good will of him that d@@ wel@@ t in the b@@ ush : let the b@@ les@@ sing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his bre@@ th@@ ren .
they shall call the people un@@ to the mountain ; there they shall offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : for they shall su@@ ck of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , and of treasures hi@@ d in the s@@ and .
and Mos@@ es went up from the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b un@@ to the mountain of N@@ eb@@ o , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . and the Lord she@@ wed him all the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to Dan ,
and the south , and the pla@@ in of the val@@ ley of Jer@@ ich@@ o , the city of pal@@ m trees , un@@ to Zo@@ ar .
and the Lord said un@@ to him , This is the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , un@@ to I@@ sa@@ ac , and un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , I will give it un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed : I have caused the@@ e to see it with th@@ ine eyes , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not go over th@@ ither .
and he buried him in a val@@ ley in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , over against Beth @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : but no man know@@ eth of his se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re un@@ to this day .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wis@@ dom ; for Mos@@ es had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to him , and did as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
in all the signs and the won@@ ders , which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
now after the death of Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , Mos@@ es ' minister , saying ,
Mos@@ es my ser@@ vant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , th@@ ou , and all this people , un@@ to the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad upon , that have I given un@@ to you , as I said un@@ to Mos@@ es .
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and this Lebanon even un@@ to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and un@@ to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
there shall not any man be able to stand before the@@ e all the days of TH@@ Y life : as I was with Mos@@ es , so I will be with the@@ e : I will not fail the@@ e , nor for@@ sake the@@ e .
be strong and of a good courage : for un@@ to this people s@@ halt th@@ ou divide for an inher@@ it@@ ance the land , which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers to give them .
this book of the law shall not de@@ part out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt medi@@ t@@ ate there@@ in day and night , that th@@ ou may@@ est observe to do according to all that is written there@@ in : for then th@@ ou s@@ halt make TH@@ Y way prosperous , and then th@@ ou s@@ halt have good success .
have not I comman@@ ded the@@ e ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be th@@ ou dis@@ may@@ ed : for the Lord TH@@ Y God is with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou go@@ est .
remember the word which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded you , saying , The Lord your God hat@@ h given you rest , and hat@@ h given you this land .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be that do@@ th rebel against TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ment , and will not he@@ arken un@@ to TH@@ Y words in all that th@@ ou comman@@ dest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and it came to pass about the time of sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : w@@ hi@@ ther the men went I wo@@ t not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall over@@ take them .
but she had brought them up to the ro@@ of of the house , and hi@@ d them with the st@@ alk@@ s of fla@@ x , which she had laid in order upon the ro@@ of .
and the men pursu@@ ed after them the way to Jordan un@@ to the for@@ ds : and as soon as they which pursu@@ ed after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
and she said un@@ to the men , I know that the Lord hat@@ h given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land fa@@ int because of you .
then she let them down by a cor@@ d through the window : for her house was upon the town wall , and she d@@ wel@@ t upon the wall .
be@@ hold , when we come into the land , th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d this line of scar@@ let thre@@ ad in the window which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st let us down by : and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring TH@@ Y father , and TH@@ Y mother , and TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and all TH@@ Y father 's household , home un@@ to the@@ e .
and if th@@ ou ut@@ ter this our business , then we will be quit of th@@ ine oath which th@@ ou h@@ ast made us to swe@@ ar .
and they went , and came un@@ to the mountain , and abo@@ de there three days , until the pursu@@ ers were returned : and the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
so the two men returned , and des@@ cen@@ ded from the mountain , and passed over , and came to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and told him all things that be@@ fell them :
and Jos@@ hua rose early in the morning ; and they removed from Sh@@ it@@ tim , and came to Jordan , he and all the children of Israel , and lo@@ d@@ ged there before they passed over .
and they comman@@ ded the people , saying , When ye see the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , and the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the pri@@ ests , saying , T@@ ake up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and went before the people .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt command the pri@@ ests that bear the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , saying , When ye are come to the br@@ ink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Jos@@ hua said , Her@@ e@@ by ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Gir@@ gas@@ hi@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites .
and it came to pass , when the people removed from their ten@@ ts , to pass over Jordan , and the pri@@ ests bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant before the people ;
and as they that b@@ are the Ar@@ k were come un@@ to Jordan , and the feet of the pri@@ ests that b@@ are the Ar@@ k were di@@ pped in the bri@@ m of the water , ( for Jordan over@@ flow@@ eth all his banks all the time of har@@ v@@ est , )
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over Jordan , that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
and Jos@@ hua set up twelve stones in the mid@@ st of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the pri@@ ests which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant stood : and they are there un@@ to this day .
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the Ar@@ k of the Lord passed over , and the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the children of G@@ ad , and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to them :
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests that b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord were come up out of the mid@@ st of Jordan , and the so@@ les of the pri@@ ests ' feet were lifted up un@@ to the d@@ ry land , that the waters of Jordan returned un@@ to their place , and flow@@ ed over all his banks , as they did before .
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ ilg@@ al , in the east border of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
for the Lord your God dri@@ ed up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we were gone over :
and this is the cause why Jos@@ hua did circum@@ c@@ ise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
now all the people that came out were circum@@ c@@ ised : but all the people that were born in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circum@@ c@@ ised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : for they were un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , because they had not circum@@ c@@ ised them by the way .
and it came to pass , when they had done circum@@ c@@ ising all the people , that they abo@@ de in their places in the camp , ti@@ ll they were whole .
and they did eat of the old cor@@ n of the land on the mor@@ row after the pass@@ over , un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es , and par@@ ched cor@@ n in the sel@@ f@@ same day .
and the man@@ na ce@@ ased on the mor@@ row after they had e@@ aten of the old cor@@ n of the land ; neither had the children of Israel man@@ na any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
and ye shall comp@@ ass the city , all ye men of war , and go round about the city once . thus s@@ halt th@@ ou do six days .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua had spoken un@@ to the people , that the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns passed on before the Lord , and ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord followed them .
and the armed men went before the pri@@ ests that ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward came after the Ar@@ k , the pri@@ ests going on , and b@@ low@@ ing with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
so the Ar@@ k of the Lord comp@@ ass@@ ed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lo@@ d@@ ged in the camp .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they comp@@ ass@@ ed the city seven times .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the pri@@ ests ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , Jos@@ hua said un@@ to the people , sh@@ out ; for the Lord hat@@ h given you the city .
and the city shall be accur@@ sed , even it , and all that are there@@ in , to the Lord : only Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers that we sent .
and ye , in any wise keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the accur@@ sed thing , lest ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves accur@@ sed , when ye take of the accur@@ sed thing , and make the camp of Israel a cur@@ se , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of br@@ ass and iron , are consec@@ rated un@@ to the Lord : they shall come into the treas@@ ury of the Lord .
but Jos@@ hua had said un@@ to the two men that had sp@@ ied out the country , G@@ o into the har@@ lot 's house , and bring out th@@ ence the woman , and all that she hat@@ h , as ye sw@@ are un@@ to her .
and the young men that were sp@@ ies went in , and brought Ra@@ ha@@ b , and her father , and her mother , and her bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kin@@ d@@ red , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was there@@ in : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron , they put into the treas@@ ury of the house of the Lord .
and Jos@@ hua sav@@ ed Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in Israel even un@@ to this day ; because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers , which Jos@@ hua sent to sp@@ y out Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ res@@ pass in the accur@@ sed thing : for A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , took of the accur@@ sed thing : and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the children of Israel .
and Jos@@ hua sent men from Jer@@ ich@@ o to A@@ I , which is bes@@ ide Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en , on the east side of Be@@ the@@ l , and sp@@ ake un@@ to them , saying , G@@ o up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed A@@ I .
and Jos@@ hua rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and fell to the ear@@ th upon his face before the Ar@@ k of the Lord until the ev@@ enti@@ de , he and the el@@ ders of Israel , and put d@@ ust upon their heads .
and Jos@@ hua said , A@@ las , O Lord God , where@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou at all brought this people over Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to destroy us ? would to God we had been content , and d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan !
and it shall be , that he that is taken with the accur@@ sed thing shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire , he and all that he hat@@ h : because he hat@@ h trans@@ g@@ ressed the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and because he hat@@ h w@@ rought Fol@@ ly in Israel .
and he brought the family of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he took the family of the Zar@@ hi@@ tes : and he brought the family of the Zar@@ hi@@ tes man by man ; and Z@@ ab@@ di was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was taken .
so Jos@@ hua sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and they ran un@@ to the tent ; and , be@@ hold , it was hi@@ d in his tent , and the silver under it .
and they took them out of the mid@@ st of the tent , and brought them un@@ to Jos@@ hua , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up against A@@ I : and Jos@@ hua chose out thirty thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , and sent them away by night .
and he comman@@ ded them , saying , be@@ hold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach un@@ to the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) ti@@ ll we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have comman@@ ded you .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew n@@ igh , and came before the city , and pit@@ ched on the north side of A@@ I : now there was a val@@ ley between them and A@@ I .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
and all the people that were in A@@ I were called together to pursue after them : and they pursu@@ ed after Jos@@ hua , and were drawn away from the city .
and there was not a man left in A@@ I or Be@@ the@@ l , that went not out after Israel : and they left the city open , and pursu@@ ed after Israel .
and the Lord said un@@ to Jos@@ hua , St@@ ret@@ ch out the spe@@ ar that is in TH@@ Y hand toward A@@ I ; for I will give it into th@@ ine hand . and Jos@@ hua stret@@ ched out the spe@@ ar that he had in his hand toward the city .
and the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and has@@ ted and set the city on fire .
and when Jos@@ hua and all Israel saw that the amb@@ ush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city as@@ cen@@ ded , then they turned again , and sle@@ w the men of A@@ I .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the mid@@ st of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smo@@ te them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where@@ in they ch@@ ased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes returned un@@ to A@@ I , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word .
and so it was , that all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of A@@ I .
for Jos@@ hua drew not his hand back , where@@ with he stret@@ ched out the spe@@ ar , until he had ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ I .
only the c@@ attle and the sp@@ oil of that city Israel took for a pre@@ y un@@ to themselves , according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua .
and he wrote there upon the stones a cop@@ y of the law of Mos@@ es , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
and after@@ ward he read all the words of the law , the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings and cur@@ s@@ ings , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
they did work w@@ il@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their ass@@ es , and wine bott@@ les , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and all that he did to the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , that were beyond Jordan , to S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and to O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , which was at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go un@@ to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and it is mo@@ ul@@ dy :
and these bott@@ les of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , be@@ hold , they be rent : and these our gar@@ ments and our sho@@ es are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they d@@ wel@@ t among them .
and the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and came un@@ to their cities on the third day . now their cities were Gi@@ be@@ on , and C@@ hep@@ hi@@ ra@@ h , and Be@@ ero@@ th , and Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im .
and the children of Israel smo@@ te them not , because the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation had sworn un@@ to them by the Lord God of Israel . and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation mur@@ mu@@ red against the pr@@ inces .
this we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wr@@ ath be upon us , because of the oath which we sw@@ are un@@ to them .
and Jos@@ hua called for them , and he sp@@ ake un@@ to them , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have ye be@@ gu@@ iled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye d@@ well among us ?
now therefore ye are Cur@@ sed , and there shall none of you be fre@@ ed from being bon@@ d@@ men , and he@@ wers of wood and Dra@@ wers of water for the house of my God .
and now , be@@ hold , we are in th@@ ine hand : as it se@@ eme@@ th good and right un@@ to the@@ e to do un@@ to us , do .
and so did he un@@ to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they sle@@ w them not .
therefore the five kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , the king of Eg@@ lon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and en@@ camp@@ ed before Gi@@ be@@ on , and made war against it .
so Jos@@ hua as@@ cen@@ ded from G@@ ilg@@ al , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
and the Lord dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted them before Israel , and sle@@ w them with a great sla@@ ughter at Gi@@ be@@ on , and ch@@ ased them along the way that go@@ eth up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on , and smo@@ te them to Az@@ ek@@ ah , and un@@ to Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah .
and stay ye not , but pursue after your enem@@ ies , and sm@@ ite the hin@@ d@@ most of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the Lord your God hat@@ h delivered them into your hand .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing them with a very great sla@@ ughter , ti@@ ll they were consu@@ med , that the rest which remained of them entered into f@@ enced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings un@@ to him out of the cave , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
and that day Jos@@ hua took Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and the king there@@ of he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , them , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah as he did un@@ to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and the Lord delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and they took it on that day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
and they took it , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and the king there@@ of , and all the cities there@@ of , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eg@@ lon ; but destroyed it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in .
and it came to pass , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or had heard those things , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , and to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , and to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the pla@@ ins south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , and in the val@@ ley , and in the borders of D@@ or on the west ,
and to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and to the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite in the mountains , and to the H@@ iv@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the s@@ and that is upon the sea shore in multi@@ tude , with hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots very many .
and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , who smo@@ te them , and ch@@ ased them un@@ to great Z@@ id@@ on , and un@@ to Mis@@ rep@@ ho@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ im , and un@@ to the val@@ ley of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and they smo@@ te them , until they left them none remaining .
and they smo@@ te all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in with the edge of the s@@ word , ut@@ ter@@ ly destroying them : there was not any left to bre@@ a@@ the : and he bur@@ n@@ t Haz@@ or with fire .
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Jos@@ hua take , and smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , and he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them , as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded .
and all the sp@@ oil of these cities , and the c@@ attle , the children of Israel took for a pre@@ y un@@ to themselves ; but every man they smo@@ te with the edge of the s@@ word , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to bre@@ a@@ the .
as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant , so did Mos@@ es command Jos@@ hua , and so did Jos@@ hua ; he left nothing und@@ one of all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
for it was of the Lord to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them ut@@ ter@@ ly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
there was none of the An@@ ak@@ ims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in G@@ ath , and in Ash@@ do@@ d , there remained .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smo@@ te , and poss@@ essed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon , and all the pla@@ in on the east :
and the coast of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , which was of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the gi@@ ants , that d@@ wel@@ t at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and at E@@ dre@@ i ,
and re@@ ig@@ ned in mount Her@@ mon , and in Sal@@ ca@@ h , and in all B@@ ash@@ an , un@@ to the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , and half G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the border of S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon .
them did Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord gave it for a possession un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the king of D@@ or in the coast of D@@ or , one ; the king of the nations of G@@ ilg@@ al , one ;
from the south , all the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and M@@ ear@@ ah that is bes@@ ide the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , un@@ to A@@ ph@@ ek , to the borders of the Am@@ ori@@ tes :
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is upon the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba un@@ to Di@@ bon ;
and all the cities of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which re@@ ig@@ ned in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , un@@ to the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : but the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ites d@@ well among the Isra@@ eli@@ tes until this day .
and their coast was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ er , did the children of Israel s@@ lay with the s@@ word among them that were sla@@ in by them .
and the border of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en was Jordan , and the border there@@ of . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en after their families , the cities and the villages there@@ of .
and Mos@@ es gave inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , even un@@ to the children of G@@ ad according to their families .
and Mos@@ es gave inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : and this was the possession of the half tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families .
and their coast was from Mah@@ an@@ aim , all B@@ ash@@ an , all the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , and all the towns of J@@ air , which are in B@@ ash@@ an , thre@@ es@@ core cities :
and half G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and E@@ dre@@ i , cities of the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g in B@@ ash@@ an , were per@@ taining un@@ to the children of Mac@@ hir the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even to the one half of the children of Mac@@ hir by their families .
these are the countries which Mos@@ es did distri@@ bute for inher@@ it@@ ance in the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , on the other side Jordan , by Jer@@ ich@@ o , eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the heads of the fa@@ thers of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , distributed for inher@@ it@@ ance to them .
for@@ ty years old was I when Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord sent me from K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea to es@@ p@@ y out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
and now , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h kept me alive , as he said , these for@@ ty and five years , even since the Lord sp@@ ake this word un@@ to Mos@@ es , while the children of Israel w@@ and@@ ered in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and now , lo , I am this day fo@@ ur@@ score and five years old .
as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Mos@@ es sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
this then was the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south coast .
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that lo@@ ok@@ eth sou@@ th@@ ward :
and it went out to the south side to Ma@@ al@@ e@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ac@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and as@@ cen@@ ded up on the south side un@@ to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea , and passed along to H@@ ez@@ ron , and went up to Ad@@ ar , and f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass to Kar@@ ka@@ a :
from th@@ ence it passed toward Az@@ mon , and went out un@@ to the river of Egypt ; and the go@@ ings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even un@@ to the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the ut@@ ter@@ most part of Jordan :
and the border went up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ la , and passed along by the north of Beth @@@ -@@ @ arab@@ ah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en :
and the border went up toward De@@ bir from the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or , and so nor@@ th@@ ward , looking toward G@@ ilg@@ al , that is before the going up to Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at En @@@ -@@ @ ro@@ gel :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill un@@ to the fo@@ un@@ tain of the water of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border was drawn to Ba@@ al@@ ah , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im :
and the border comp@@ ass@@ ed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to mount Se@@ ir , and passed along un@@ to the side of mount J@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the border went out un@@ to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward : and the border was drawn to Sh@@ ic@@ ron , and passed along to mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out un@@ to J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast there@@ of . this is the coast of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h round about according to their families .
Ash@@ do@@ d with her towns and her villages , Gaza with her towns and her villages , un@@ to the river of Egypt , and the great sea , and the border there@@ of :
as for the Je@@ bu@@ sites the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , the children of Ju@@ da@@ h could not drive them out : but the Je@@ bu@@ sites d@@ well with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h at Jer@@ usalem un@@ to this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jer@@ ich@@ o , un@@ to the water of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the east , to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness that go@@ eth up from Jer@@ ich@@ o throughout mount Be@@ the@@ l ,
and go@@ eth down w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the coast of Jap@@ h@@ le@@ ti , un@@ to the coast of Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , and to Ge@@ zer : and the go@@ ings out there@@ of are at the sea .
and the border of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families was thus : even the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance on the east side was A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , un@@ to Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the up@@ per ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eas@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and passed by it on the east to Jan@@ o@@ ha@@ h ;
and it went down from Jan@@ o@@ ha@@ h to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and to Na@@ ar@@ ath , and came to Jer@@ ich@@ o , and went out at Jordan .
the border went out from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im by their families .
and the separate cities for the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im were among the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , all the cities with their villages .
there was also a lot for the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph ; to w@@ it , for Mac@@ hir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad : because he was a man of war , therefore he had G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and B@@ ash@@ an .
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families ; for the children of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er , and for the children of H@@ ele@@ k , and for the children of As@@ ri@@ el , and for the children of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and for the children of Hep@@ her , and for the children of Sh@@ em@@ ida : these were the male children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph by their families .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of Hep@@ her , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and these are the names of his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , Mah@@ lah , and No@@ ah , Ho@@ g@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was from As@@ her to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah , that li@@ eth before Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the border went along on the right hand un@@ to the inhabitants of En @@@ -@@ @ tap@@ pu@@ ah .
and the coast des@@ cen@@ ded un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah , sou@@ th@@ ward of the river : these cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im are among the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h also was on the north side of the river , and the out@@ go@@ ings of it were at the sea :
sou@@ th@@ ward it was E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's , and nor@@ th@@ ward it was Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in As@@ her on the north , and in Is@@ sac@@ har on the east .
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had in Is@@ sac@@ har and in As@@ her Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , and I@@ ble@@ am and her towns , and the inhabitants of D@@ or and her towns , and the inhabitants of En@@ dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , even three countries .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were wa@@ x@@ en strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tri@@ bute ; but did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , T@@ ho@@ u art a great people , and h@@ ast great power : th@@ ou s@@ halt not have one lot only :
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel assemb@@ led together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation there . and the land was sub@@ du@@ ed before them .
give out from among you three men for each tri@@ be : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inher@@ it@@ ance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Ju@@ da@@ h shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their co@@ asts on the north .
Y@@ e shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the descri@@ ption hi@@ ther to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
and Jos@@ hua cast lots for them in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h before the Lord : and there Jos@@ hua divided the land un@@ to the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
and their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north side , and went up through the mountains w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en .
and the border went over from th@@ ence toward L@@ uz , to the side of L@@ uz , which is Be@@ the@@ l , sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the border des@@ cen@@ ded to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ ar , near the hill that li@@ eth on the south side of the ne@@ ther Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on .
and the border was drawn th@@ ence , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the cor@@ ner of the sea sou@@ th@@ ward , from the hill that li@@ eth before Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , a city of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h : this was the west quarter .
and the south quarter was from the end of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , and the border went out on the west , and went out to the well of waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah :
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , and des@@ cen@@ ded to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah nor@@ th@@ ward : and the out@@ go@@ ings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
and Jordan was the border of it on the east side . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Benjamin , by the co@@ asts there@@ of round about , according to their families .
now the cities of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jer@@ ich@@ o , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah , and the val@@ ley of K@@ ez@@ iz ,
and Ze@@ lah , Ele@@ p@@ h , and J@@ eb@@ us@@ i , which is Jer@@ usalem , Gi@@ be@@ ath , and Kir@@ j@@ ath ; fo@@ ur@@ teen cities with their villages . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and the second lot came forth to Simeon , even for the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon according to their families : and their inher@@ it@@ ance was within the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Ba@@ al@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ beer , Ram@@ ath of the south . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon according to their families .
out of the portion of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inher@@ it@@ ance within the inher@@ it@@ ance of them .
and the third lot came up for the children of Ze@@ bul@@ un according to their families : and the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance was un@@ to Sar@@ id :
and their border went up toward the sea , and Mar@@ al@@ ah , and reached to Dab@@ bas@@ het@@ h , and reached to the river that is before Jok@@ ne@@ am ;
and the border comp@@ ass@@ eth it on the north side to H@@ ann@@ athon : and the out@@ go@@ ings there@@ of are in the val@@ ley of J@@ ip@@ h@@ th@@ ah @@@ -@@ @ el :
and the coast reac@@ het@@ h to T@@ ab@@ or , and Sha@@ haz@@ im@@ ah , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h ; and the out@@ go@@ ings of their border were at Jordan : six@@ teen cities with their villages .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and tur@@ net@@ h toward the sun@@ rising to Beth @@@ -@@ @ da@@ g@@ on , and reac@@ het@@ h to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to the val@@ ley of J@@ ip@@ h@@ th@@ ah @@@ -@@ @ el toward the north side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ E@@ mek , and Ne@@ i@@ el , and go@@ eth out to Cab@@ ul on the left hand ,
and then the coast tur@@ net@@ h to Ram@@ ah , and to the strong city T@@ y@@ re ; and the coast tur@@ net@@ h to Hos@@ ah ; and the out@@ go@@ ings there@@ of are at the sea from the coast to A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b :
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of As@@ her according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out to the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , even for the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i according to their families , the cities and their villages .
this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
when they had made an end of dividing the land for inher@@ it@@ ance by their co@@ asts , the children of Israel gave an inher@@ it@@ ance to Jos@@ hua the son of nun among them :
according to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked , even Tim@@ n@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ser@@ ah in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and he built the city , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in .
the Lord also sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
and the children of Israel gave un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes out of their inher@@ it@@ ance , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , these cities and their subur@@ bs .
and the lot came out for the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : and the children of Aaron the pri@@ est , which were of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had by lot out of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , thir@@ teen cities .
and the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
and the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
the children of Mer@@ ari by their families had out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and the children of Israel gave by lot un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes these cities with their subur@@ bs , as the Lord comman@@ ded by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi , had : for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
and they gave them the city of Ar@@ ba the father of An@@ ak , which city is He@@ br@@ on , in the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the subur@@ bs there@@ of round about it .
but the fields of the city , and the villages there@@ of , gave they to Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h for his possession .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the pri@@ est He@@ br@@ on with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Lib@@ n@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ,
and A@@ in with her subur@@ bs , and J@@ ut@@ ta@@ h with her subur@@ bs , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h with her subur@@ bs ; nine cities out of those two tri@@ bes .
and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , Gi@@ be@@ on with her subur@@ bs , Ge@@ ba with her subur@@ bs ,
and the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes which remained of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and un@@ to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the other half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h they gave G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Be@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ter@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ; two cities .
and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , K@@ ede@@ sh in Gal@@ il@@ ee with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Ham@@ mo@@ th @@@ -@@ @ dor with her subur@@ bs , and K@@ artan with her subur@@ bs ; three cities .
and un@@ to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Jok@@ ne@@ am with her subur@@ bs , and Kar@@ ta@@ h with her subur@@ bs ,
so all the cities for the children of Mer@@ ari by their families , which were remaining of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , were by their lot twelve cities .
and the Lord gave them rest round about , according to all that he sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers : and there stood not a man of all their enem@@ ies before them ; the Lord delivered all their enem@@ ies into their hand .
now to the one half of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Mos@@ es had given possession in B@@ ash@@ an : but un@@ to the other half there@@ of gave Jos@@ hua among their bre@@ th@@ ren on this side Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . and when Jos@@ hua sent them away also un@@ to their ten@@ ts , then he b@@ les@@ sed them ,
and when they came un@@ to the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h built there an alt@@ ar by Jordan , a great alt@@ ar to see to .
and the children of Israel heard say , be@@ hold , the chi@@ d@@ ren of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have built an alt@@ ar over against the land of Can@@ a@@ an , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up to war against them .
and the children of Israel sent un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and with him ten pr@@ inces , of each chief house a pr@@ ince throughout all the tri@@ bes of Israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fa@@ thers among the thousands of Israel .
and they came un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , un@@ to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they sp@@ ake with them , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord , What t@@ res@@ pass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have buil@@ ded you an alt@@ ar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
is the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we are not cleans@@ ed until this day , although there was a pla@@ gue in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord ,
but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord ? and it will be , seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord , that to mor@@ row he will be wro@@ th with the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
then the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h answ@@ ered , and said un@@ to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an alt@@ ar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer there@@ on bur@@ n@@ t offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offer@@ ings there@@ on , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak un@@ to our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
for the Lord hat@@ h made Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Re@@ ub@@ en and children of G@@ ad ; ye have no part in the Lord : so shall your children make our children ce@@ ase from fearing the Lord .
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sp@@ ake , it pleased them .
and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces , returned from the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and from the children of G@@ ad , out of the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest un@@ to Israel from all their enem@@ ies round about , that Jos@@ hua wa@@ xed old and stric@@ ken in age .
and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hat@@ h done un@@ to all these nations because of you ; for the Lord your God is he that hat@@ h fought for you .
and the Lord your God , he shall exp@@ el them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall poss@@ ess their land , as the Lord your God hat@@ h promised un@@ to you .
be ye therefore very cour@@ age@@ ous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Mos@@ es , that ye turn not aside there@@ from to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to them :
for the Lord hat@@ h driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hat@@ h been able to stand before you un@@ to this day .
one man of you shall ch@@ ase a thousand : for the Lord your God , he it is that figh@@ te@@ th for you , as he hat@@ h promised you .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cle@@ ave un@@ to the re@@ mn@@ ant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marri@@ ages with them , and go in un@@ to them , and they to you :
and Jos@@ hua gathered all the tri@@ bes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the el@@ ders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Ab@@ ra@@ ham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and multi@@ p@@ lied his se@@ ed , and gave him I@@ sa@@ ac .
and I brought your fa@@ thers out of Egypt : and ye came un@@ to the sea ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed after your fa@@ thers with char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men un@@ to the Red sea .
and when they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , he put d@@ ark@@ ness between you and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : and ye d@@ wel@@ t in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a long season .
and I brought you into the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might poss@@ ess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came un@@ to Jer@@ ich@@ o : and the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Gir@@ gas@@ hi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dra@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ; but not with TH@@ Y s@@ word , nor with TH@@ Y bo@@ w .
and the Lord dra@@ ve out from before us all the people , even the Am@@ ori@@ tes which d@@ wel@@ t in the land : therefore will we also serve the Lord ; for he is our God .
and Jos@@ hua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an o@@ ak , that was by the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord .
and Jos@@ hua said un@@ to all the people , be@@ hold , this stone shall be a witness un@@ to us ; for it hat@@ h heard all the words of the Lord which he sp@@ ake un@@ to us : it shall be therefore a witness un@@ to you , lest ye deny your God .
and it came to pass after these things , that Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ser@@ ah , which is in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north side of the hill of G@@ a@@ ash .
and Israel served the Lord all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders that over@@ lived Jos@@ hua , and which had known all the works of the Lord , that he had done for Israel .
now after the death of Jos@@ hua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying , Wh@@ o shall go up for us against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites first , to fight against them ?
and Ju@@ da@@ h went up ; and the Lord delivered the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes into their hand : and they sle@@ w of them in B@@ ez@@ ek ten thousand men .
now the children of Ju@@ da@@ h had fought against Jer@@ usalem , and had taken it , and s@@ mit@@ ten it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
and after@@ ward the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , that d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and in the south , and in the val@@ ley .
and Ju@@ da@@ h went against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in He@@ br@@ on : ( now the name of He@@ br@@ on before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba : ) and they sle@@ w Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Ah@@ im@@ an , and Tal@@ ma@@ i .
and it came to pass , when she came to him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she ligh@@ ted from off her ass ; and Cal@@ e@@ b said un@@ to her , What w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou ?
and the children of the Ken@@ ite , Mos@@ es ' father in law , went up out of the city of pal@@ m trees with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ h , which li@@ eth in the south of Ara@@ d ; and they went and d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
and the Lord was with Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he dra@@ ve out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the val@@ ley , because they had char@@ i@@ ots of iron .
and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Je@@ bu@@ sites that inhabited Jer@@ usalem ; but the Je@@ bu@@ sites d@@ well with the children of Benjamin in Jer@@ usalem un@@ to this day .
and when he she@@ wed them the entrance into the city , they smo@@ te the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let go the man and all his family .
and the man went into the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and built a city , and called the name there@@ of L@@ uz : which is the name there@@ of un@@ to this day .
neither did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h drive out the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , nor Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of D@@ or and her towns , nor the inhabitants of I@@ ble@@ am and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns : but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tri@@ bute , and did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
neither did As@@ her drive out the inhabitants of Ac@@ cho , nor the inhabitants of Z@@ id@@ on , nor of Ah@@ lab , nor of A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b , nor of Hel@@ bah , nor of Ap@@ hi@@ k , nor of Re@@ ho@@ b :
but the Ash@@ er@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
neither did Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i drive out the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , nor the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath ; but he d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h and of Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath became tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to them .
and the Am@@ ori@@ tes forced the children of Dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer them to come down to the val@@ ley :
but the Am@@ ori@@ tes would d@@ well in mount Her@@ es in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prev@@ ailed , so that they became tri@@ but@@ aries .
and an an@@ gel of the Lord came up from G@@ ilg@@ al to Bo@@ c@@ him , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you un@@ to the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers ; and I said , I will never break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their al@@ tar@@ s : but ye have not obe@@ yed my voice : why have ye done this ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thor@@ ns in your sides , and their go@@ ds shall be a sn@@ are un@@ to you .
and it came to pass , when the an@@ gel of the Lord sp@@ ake these words un@@ to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders that out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ her@@ es , in the mount of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north side of the hill G@@ a@@ ash .
and also all that generation were gathered un@@ to their fa@@ thers : and there ar@@ ose another generation after them , which knew not the Lord , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
and they for@@ so@@ ok the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the people that were round about them , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them , and provoked the Lord to an@@ ger .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of sp@@ o@@ ilers that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enem@@ ies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enem@@ ies .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for ev@@ il , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn un@@ to them : and they were greatly dist@@ ressed .
nevertheless the Lord raised up judges , which delivered them out of the hand of those that sp@@ o@@ iled them .
and yet they would not he@@ arken un@@ to their judges , but they went a wh@@ oring after other go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fa@@ thers walked in , obe@@ ying the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and he said , Bec@@ ause that this people hat@@ h trans@@ g@@ ressed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I comman@@ ded their fa@@ thers , and have not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to my voice ;
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk there@@ in , as their fa@@ thers did keep it , or not .
name@@ ly , five lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes that d@@ wel@@ t in mount Lebanon , from mount Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ her@@ mon un@@ to the entering in of Ham@@ ath .
and they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would he@@ arken un@@ to the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , which he comman@@ ded their fa@@ thers by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and for@@ g@@ at the Lord their God , and served Ba@@ al@@ im and the gro@@ ves .
therefore the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Ch@@ us@@ han @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia : and the children of Israel served Ch@@ us@@ han @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim eight years .
and when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ e@@ b 's younger brother .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
but when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliver@@ er , E@@ h@@ ud the son of Ger@@ a , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a man le@@ f@@ than@@ ded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present un@@ to Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and E@@ h@@ ud came un@@ to him ; and he was sitting in a summer par@@ l@@ our , which he had for himself alone . and E@@ h@@ ud said , I have a message from God un@@ to the@@ e . and he ar@@ ose out of his seat .
and E@@ h@@ ud put forth his left hand , and took the da@@ g@@ ger from his right th@@ igh , and th@@ rust it into his bel@@ ly :
and the haf@@ t also went in after the bla@@ de ; and the f@@ at closed upon the bla@@ de , so that he could not draw the da@@ g@@ ger out of his bel@@ ly ; and the dir@@ t came out .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , be@@ hold , the doors of the par@@ l@@ our were locked , they said , su@@ rely he cover@@ eth his feet in his summer chamber .
and they tar@@ ried ti@@ ll they were as@@ ha@@ med : and , be@@ hold , he opened not the doors of the par@@ l@@ our ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
and it came to pass , when he was come , that he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et in the mountain of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
and they sle@@ w of Mo@@ a@@ b at that time about ten thousand men , all lu@@ st@@ y , and all men of val@@ our ; and there escaped not a man .
now He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite , which was of the children of H@@ ob@@ a@@ b the father in law of Mos@@ es , had sever@@ ed himself from the Ken@@ ites , and pit@@ ched his tent un@@ to the pla@@ in of Za@@ an@@ aim , which is by K@@ ede@@ sh .
and Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les un@@ to the river of K@@ ish@@ on .
and the Lord dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted Sis@@ era , and all his char@@ i@@ ots , and all his host , with the edge of the s@@ word before B@@ arak ; so that Sis@@ era ligh@@ ted down off his char@@ i@@ ot , and fled away on his feet .
but B@@ arak pursu@@ ed after the char@@ i@@ ots , and after the host , un@@ to Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and all the host of Sis@@ era fell upon the edge of the s@@ word ; and there was not a man left .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it Sis@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite : for there was peace between J@@ ab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
and Ja@@ el went out to meet Sis@@ era , and said un@@ to him , Tur@@ n in , my lor@@ d , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in un@@ to her into the tent , she covered him with a man@@ tle .
and he said un@@ to her , Gi@@ ve me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a little water to drink ; for I am thir@@ st@@ y . and she opened a bot@@ tle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
again he said un@@ to her , St@@ and in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man do@@ th come and inqu@@ ire of the@@ e , and say , Is there any man here ? that th@@ ou s@@ halt say , No .
and , be@@ hold , as B@@ arak pursu@@ ed Sis@@ era , Ja@@ el came out to meet him , and said un@@ to him , C@@ ome , and I will she@@ w the@@ e the man whom th@@ ou seek@@ est . and when he came into her tent , be@@ hold , Sis@@ era lay dead , and the na@@ il was in his temp@@ les .
and the hand of the children of Israel prosp@@ ered , and prev@@ ailed against J@@ ab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
hear , O ye kings ; give e@@ ar , O ye pr@@ inces ; I , even I , will sing un@@ to the Lord ; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel .
Lord , when th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test out of Se@@ ir , when th@@ ou mar@@ ch@@ ed@@ st out of the field of E@@ dom , the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and the heav@@ ens dropped , the cl@@ ou@@ ds also dropped water .
in the days of Sh@@ am@@ gar the son of An@@ ath , in the days of Ja@@ el , the highways were un@@ occupied , and the travellers walked through by@@ ways .
they that are delivered from the no@@ ise of ar@@ chers in the places of drawing water , there shall they re@@ hear@@ se the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the Lord , even the righ@@ te@@ ous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
then he made him that remain@@ eth have domin@@ ion over the no@@ bles among the people : the Lord made me have domin@@ ion over the m@@ igh@@ ty .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after the@@ e , Benjamin , among TH@@ Y people ; out of Mac@@ hir came down govern@@ ors , and out of Ze@@ bul@@ un they that handle the p@@ en of the writer .
and the pr@@ inces of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah ; even Is@@ sac@@ har , and also B@@ arak : he was sent on fo@@ ot into the val@@ ley . for the divisions of Re@@ ub@@ en there were great th@@ ou@@ ghts of heart .
cur@@ se ye Mer@@ oz , said the an@@ gel of the Lord , cur@@ se ye bit@@ ter@@ ly the inhabitants there@@ of ; because they came not to the help of the Lord , to the help of the Lord against the m@@ igh@@ ty .
she put her hand to the na@@ il , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer ; and with the ham@@ mer she smo@@ te Sis@@ era , she smo@@ te off his head , when she had pi@@ er@@ ced and stric@@ ken through his temp@@ les .
at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell : where he bo@@ wed , there he fell down dead .
so let all th@@ ine enem@@ ies per@@ ish , O Lord : but let them that love him be as the sun when he go@@ eth forth in his might . and the land had rest for@@ ty years .
and the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel : and because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and c@@ aves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
and they en@@ camp@@ ed against them , and destroyed the increase of the ear@@ th , ti@@ ll th@@ ou come un@@ to Gaza , and left no sust@@ en@@ ance for Israel , neither she@@ ep , nor o@@ x , nor ass .
for they came up with their c@@ attle and their ten@@ ts , and they came as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers for multi@@ tude ; for both they and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and it came to pass , when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ,
that the Lord sent a pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to the children of Israel , which said un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all that op@@ pressed you , and dra@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said un@@ to you , I am the Lord your God ; fear not the go@@ ds of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , in whose land ye d@@ well : but ye have not obe@@ yed my voice .
and there came an an@@ gel of the Lord , and sat under an o@@ ak which was in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , that per@@ tained un@@ to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ r@@ ite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on th@@ res@@ hed wheat by the win@@ e@@ press , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and G@@ ide@@ on went in , and made ready a k@@ id , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fl@@ our : the f@@ les@@ h he put in a bas@@ ket , and he put the bro@@ th in a po@@ t , and brought it out un@@ to him under the o@@ ak , and presented it .
and when G@@ ide@@ on perceived that he was an an@@ gel of the Lord , G@@ ide@@ on said , A@@ las , O Lord God ! for because I have seen an an@@ gel of the Lord face to face .
and build an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bul@@ lock , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice with the wood of the gro@@ ve which th@@ ou s@@ halt cut down .
then G@@ ide@@ on took ten men of his servants , and did as the Lord had said un@@ to him : and so it was , because he fear@@ ed his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and when the men of the city ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al was cast down , and the gro@@ ve was cut down that was by it , and the second bul@@ lock was offered upon the alt@@ ar that was built .
then the men of the city said un@@ to Jo@@ ash , Br@@ ing out TH@@ Y son , that he may die : because he hat@@ h cast down the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al , and because he hat@@ h cut down the gro@@ ve that was by it .
but the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon G@@ ide@@ on , and he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et ; and A@@ bi @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ er was gathered after him .
and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers throughout all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to As@@ her , and un@@ to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and un@@ to Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i ; and they came up to meet them .
be@@ hold , I will put a F@@ le@@ ece of wo@@ ol in the floor ; and if the dew be on the F@@ le@@ ece only , and it be d@@ ry upon all the ear@@ th bes@@ ide , then shall I know that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t save Israel by mine hand , as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
and it was so : for he rose up early on the mor@@ row , and th@@ rust the F@@ le@@ ece together , and wr@@ ing@@ ed the dew out of the F@@ le@@ ece , a bo@@ w@@ l full of water .
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pit@@ ched bes@@ ide the well of Har@@ od : so that the host of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Mo@@ re@@ h , in the val@@ ley .
and the Lord said un@@ to G@@ ide@@ on , The people that are with the@@ e are too many for me to give the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into their hands , lest Israel va@@ un@@ t themselves against me , saying , M@@ ine own hand hat@@ h sav@@ ed me .
now therefore go to , procla@@ im in the e@@ ars of the people , saying , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever is fear@@ ful and afraid , let him return and de@@ part early from mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
so he brought down the people un@@ to the water : and the Lord said un@@ to G@@ ide@@ on , Every one that lap@@ pet@@ h of the water with his ton@@ gue , as a do@@ g lap@@ pet@@ h , him s@@ halt th@@ ou set by himself ; likewise every one that bo@@ w@@ eth down upon his k@@ ne@@ es to drink .
and the number of them that la@@ pped , putting their hand to their m@@ outh , were three hundred men : but all the rest of the people bo@@ wed down upon their k@@ ne@@ es to drink water .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt hear what they say ; and after@@ ward shall th@@ ine hands be strengthened to go down un@@ to the host . then went he down with P@@ hur@@ ah his ser@@ vant un@@ to the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and by the sea side for multi@@ tude .
and it was so , when G@@ ide@@ on heard the telling of the dream , and the interpre@@ tation there@@ of , that he wor@@ shi@@ pped , and returned into the host of Israel , and said , arise ; for the Lord hat@@ h delivered into your hand the host of Mi@@ dian .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a tr@@ ump@@ et in every man 's hand , with empty pit@@ chers , and lam@@ ps within the pit@@ chers .
when I blow with a tr@@ ump@@ et , I and all that are with me , then blow ye the tr@@ ump@@ ets also on every side of all the camp , and say , The s@@ word of the Lord , and of G@@ ide@@ on .
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp : and all the host ran , and cri@@ ed , and fled .
and the three hundred ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and the Lord set every man 's s@@ word against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ it@@ ta@@ h in Zer@@ er@@ ath , and to the border of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , un@@ to T@@ ab@@ b@@ ath .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of As@@ her , and out of all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and pursu@@ ed after the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y h@@ ast th@@ ou served us thus , that th@@ ou cal@@ led@@ st us not , when th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test to fight with the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ? and they did chi@@ de with him sharply .
God hat@@ h delivered into your hands the pr@@ inces of Mi@@ dian , O@@ re@@ b and Ze@@ e@@ b : and what was I able to do in comparison of you ? then their an@@ ger was ab@@ ated toward him , when he had said that .
and he said un@@ to the men of Suc@@ co@@ th , Gi@@ ve , I pra@@ y you , lo@@ aves of bread un@@ to the people that follow me ; for they be fa@@ int , and I am pursuing after Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na , kings of Mi@@ dian .
now Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ kor , and their hosts with them , about fif@@ teen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew s@@ word .
and G@@ ide@@ on went up by the way of them that d@@ wel@@ t in ten@@ ts on the east of N@@ ob@@ ah and Jo@@ g@@ beha@@ h , and smo@@ te the host : for the host was secure .
and caught a young man of the men of Suc@@ co@@ th , and inqu@@ ired of him : and he described un@@ to him the pr@@ inces of Suc@@ co@@ th , and the el@@ ders there@@ of , even thre@@ es@@ core and se@@ ven@@ teen men .
and he took the el@@ ders of the city , and thor@@ ns of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and bri@@ ers , and with them he ta@@ ught the men of Suc@@ co@@ th .
then the men of Israel said un@@ to G@@ ide@@ on , R@@ ule th@@ ou over us , both th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y son 's son also : for th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered us from the hand of Mi@@ dian .
thus was Mi@@ dian sub@@ du@@ ed before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness for@@ ty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash died in a good old age , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of Jo@@ ash his father , in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h of the A@@ bi @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ ri@@ tes .
and it came to pass , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a wh@@ oring after Ba@@ al@@ im , and made Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
and the children of Israel remember@@ ed not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enem@@ ies on every side :
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem un@@ to his mother 's bre@@ th@@ ren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's bre@@ th@@ ren sp@@ ake of him in the e@@ ars of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hear@@ ts inc@@ lined to follow A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch ; for they said , He is our brother .
and they gave him thre@@ es@@ core and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith , where@@ with A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch hired v@@ ain and light persons , which followed him .
and he went un@@ to his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and sle@@ w his bre@@ th@@ ren the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing yet Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hi@@ d himself .
and all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem gathered together , and all the house of Mil@@ lo , and went , and made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , by the pla@@ in of the pil@@ lar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood in the top of mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cri@@ ed , and said un@@ to them , Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , ye men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may he@@ arken un@@ to you .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sinc@@ er@@ ely , in that ye have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , and if ye have dealt well with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and his house , and have done un@@ to him according to the de@@ serving of his hands ;
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sla@@ in his sons , thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , the son of his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ; )
if ye then have dealt truly and sinc@@ er@@ ely with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and with his house this day , then re@@ jo@@ ice ye in A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and let him also re@@ jo@@ ice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and dev@@ our the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and the house of Mil@@ lo ; and let fire come out from the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and from the house of Mil@@ lo , and dev@@ our A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and Jo@@ th@@ am ran away , and fled , and went to Be@@ er , and d@@ wel@@ t there , for fear of A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch his brother .
then God sent an ev@@ il spirit between A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch :
and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they ro@@ bbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed came with his bre@@ th@@ ren , and went over to Sh@@ ec@@ hem : and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem put their confidence in him .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their v@@ ine@@ yards , and tro@@ de the grap@@ es , and made mer@@ ry , and went into the house of their go@@ d , and did eat and drink , and Cur@@ sed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and when Ze@@ bul the ru@@ ler of the city heard the words of G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed , his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led .
and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch priv@@ ily , saying , be@@ hold , G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed and his bre@@ th@@ ren be come to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and , be@@ hold , they for@@ ti@@ fy the city against the@@ e .
now therefore up by night , th@@ ou and the people that is with the@@ e , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , th@@ ou s@@ halt rise early , and set upon the city : and , be@@ hold , when he and the people that is with him come out against the@@ e , then may@@ est th@@ ou do to them as th@@ ou s@@ halt find occasion .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Sh@@ ec@@ hem in four companies .
and G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that the people went out into the field ; and they told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , be@@ hold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smo@@ te them .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and sle@@ w them .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and sle@@ w the people that was there@@ in , and beat down the city , and so@@ wed it with salt .
and when all the men of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the go@@ d Ber@@ ith .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his b@@ ough , and followed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and th@@ ither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and g@@ at them up to the top of the to@@ wer .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch came un@@ to the to@@ wer , and fought against it , and went hard un@@ to the door of the to@@ wer to bur@@ n it with fire .
and a certain woman cast a piece of a mil@@ l@@ stone upon A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's head , and all to br@@ ake his s@@ kul@@ l .
and when the men of Israel saw that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch was dead , they depar@@ ted every man un@@ to his place .
and he had thirty sons that ro@@ de on thirty ass col@@ ts , and they had thirty cities , which are called Hav@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ j@@ air un@@ to this day , which are in the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord , and served Ba@@ al@@ im , and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and the go@@ ds of Syria , and the go@@ ds of Z@@ id@@ on , and the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the go@@ ds of the children of Am@@ mon , and the go@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and for@@ so@@ ok the Lord , and served not him .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hands of the children of Am@@ mon .
moreover the children of Am@@ mon passed over Jordan to fight also against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against Benjamin , and against the house of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; so that Israel was sor@@ e dist@@ ressed .
and the Lord said un@@ to the children of Israel , did not I deliver you from the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and from the Am@@ ori@@ tes , from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
the Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians also , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the Ma@@ on@@ ites , did op@@ press you ; and ye cri@@ ed to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
and the children of Israel said un@@ to the Lord , We have sin@@ ned : do th@@ ou un@@ to us wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever se@@ eme@@ th good un@@ to the@@ e ; deliver us only , we pra@@ y the@@ e , this day .
then the children of Am@@ mon were gathered together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . and the children of Israel assemb@@ led themselves together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and the people and pr@@ inces of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad said one to another , What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Am@@ mon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his bre@@ th@@ ren , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain men to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and went out with him .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel .
and it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to f@@ et@@ ch J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b :
and the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad said un@@ to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , T@@ her@@ e@@ fore we turn again to the@@ e now , that th@@ ou may@@ est go with us , and fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , What h@@ ast th@@ ou to do with me , that th@@ ou art come against me to fight in my land ?
but when Israel came up from Egypt , and walked through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness un@@ to the Red sea , and came to K@@ ade@@ sh ;
and Israel sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon ; and Israel said un@@ to him , Let us pass , we pra@@ y the@@ e , through TH@@ Y land into my place .
and the Lord God of Israel delivered S@@ ih@@ on and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smo@@ te them : so Israel poss@@ essed all the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the inhabitants of that country .
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou poss@@ ess that which Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h TH@@ Y go@@ d gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess ? so wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us , them will we poss@@ ess .
and now art th@@ ou any thing better than Bal@@ ak the son of Z@@ ip@@ por , king of Mo@@ a@@ b ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
while Israel d@@ wel@@ t in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and her towns , and in A@@ ro@@ er and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the co@@ asts of Ar@@ non , three hundred years ? why therefore did ye not rec@@ over them within that time ?
then the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon .
then it shall be , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever co@@ me@@ th forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Am@@ mon , shall su@@ rely be the Lord 's , and I will offer it up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah came to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h un@@ to his house , and , be@@ hold , his daughter came out to meet him with tim@@ bre@@ ls and with dan@@ ces : and she was his only child ; bes@@ ide her he had neither son nor daughter .
and she said un@@ to her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my fel@@ lows .
and the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im gathered themselves together , and went nor@@ th@@ ward , and said un@@ to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore pass@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou over to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and di@@ d@@ st not call us to go with the@@ e ? we will bur@@ n th@@ ine house upon the@@ e with fire .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand : where@@ fore then are ye come up un@@ to me this day , to fight against me ?
and J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah jud@@ ged Israel six years . then died J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was buried in one of the cities of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and there was a certain man of Zor@@ ah , of the family of the Dani@@ tes , whose name was Man@@ o@@ ah ; and his wife was bar@@ ren , and b@@ are not .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord appeared un@@ to the woman , and said un@@ to her , be@@ hold now , th@@ ou art bar@@ ren , and be@@ ar@@ est not : but th@@ ou s@@ halt conce@@ ive , and bear a son .
for , lo , th@@ ou s@@ halt conce@@ ive , and bear a son ; and no ras@@ or shall come on his head : for the child shall be a N@@ azar@@ ite un@@ to God from the w@@ om@@ b : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
then the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came un@@ to me , and his coun@@ tenance was like the coun@@ tenance of an an@@ gel of God , very ter@@ ri@@ ble : but I asked him not wh@@ ence he was , neither told he me his name :
then Man@@ o@@ ah in@@ treated the Lord , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st send come again un@@ to us , and te@@ ach us what we shall do un@@ to the child that shall be born .
and God hear@@ ken@@ ed to the voice of Man@@ o@@ ah ; and the an@@ gel of God came again un@@ to the woman as she sat in the field : but Man@@ o@@ ah her husband was not with her .
she may not eat of any thing that co@@ me@@ th of the v@@ ine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any un@@ clean thing : all that I comman@@ ded her let her observe .
and Man@@ o@@ ah said un@@ to the an@@ gel of the Lord , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let us de@@ tain the@@ e , until we shall have made ready a k@@ id for the@@ e .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to Man@@ o@@ ah , Th@@ ough th@@ ou de@@ tain me , I will not eat of TH@@ Y bread : and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering , th@@ ou must offer it un@@ to the Lord . for Man@@ o@@ ah knew not that he was an an@@ gel of the Lord .
so Man@@ o@@ ah took a k@@ id with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock un@@ to the Lord : and the an@@ gel did won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly ; and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
for it came to pass , when the fla@@ me went up toward heav@@ en from off the alt@@ ar , that the an@@ gel of the Lord as@@ cen@@ ded in the fla@@ me of the alt@@ ar . and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
but the an@@ gel of the Lord did no more appear to Man@@ o@@ ah and to his wife . then Man@@ o@@ ah knew that he was an an@@ gel of the Lord .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ath of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord , that he sought an occasion against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : for at that time the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had domin@@ ion over Israel .
then went Sam@@ son down , and his father and his mother , to Tim@@ n@@ ath , and came to the v@@ ine@@ yards of Tim@@ n@@ ath : and , be@@ hold , a young lion ro@@ ar@@ ed against him .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a k@@ id , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the car@@ case of the lion : and , be@@ hold , there was a s@@ warm of be@@ es and hon@@ ey in the car@@ case of the lion .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing cor@@ n of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks , and also the standing cor@@ n , with the v@@ ine@@ yards and ol@@ ives .
and he smo@@ te them hip and th@@ igh with a great sla@@ ughter : and he went down and d@@ wel@@ t in the top of the rock E@@ tam .
and they said un@@ to him , We are come down to bin@@ d the@@ e , that we may deliver the@@ e into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and Sam@@ son said un@@ to them , swe@@ ar un@@ to me , that ye will not fall upon me yo@@ ur@@ selves .
and he found a new j@@ aw@@ bone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and sle@@ w a thousand men there@@ with .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand , and called that place Ram@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ le@@ hi .
and he was sor@@ e a@@ thir@@ st , and called on the Lord , and said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast given this great deliver@@ ance into the hand of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : and now shall I die for thir@@ st , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ?
and Sam@@ son said un@@ to her , If they bin@@ d me with seven green with@@ s that were never dri@@ ed , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his sou@@ l was v@@ ex@@ ed un@@ to death ;
and she said , The Phil@@ ist@@ ines be upon the@@ e , Sam@@ son . and he aw@@ oke out of his sle@@ ep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he w@@ ist not that the Lord was depar@@ ted from him .
but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass ; and he did gr@@ ind in the prison house .
then the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice un@@ to D@@ agon their go@@ d , and to re@@ jo@@ ice : for they said , Our go@@ d hat@@ h delivered Sam@@ son our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d : for they said , Our go@@ d hat@@ h delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destro@@ yer of our country , which sle@@ w many of us .
and it came to pass , when their hear@@ ts were mer@@ ry , that they said , C@@ all for Sam@@ son , that he may make us sport . and they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pil@@ lars .
and Sam@@ son said un@@ to the la@@ d that held him by the hand , suffer me that I may feel the pil@@ lars where@@ upon the house stan@@ de@@ th , that I may le@@ an upon them .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were there ; and there were upon the ro@@ of about three thousand men and women , that be@@ held while Sam@@ son made sport .
and Sam@@ son took hold of the two middle pil@@ lars upon which the house stood , and on which it was bor@@ ne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
yet he restored the money un@@ to his mother ; and his mother took two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made there@@ of a Gra@@ ven image and a m@@ ol@@ ten image : and they were in the house of Mic@@ ah .
in those days there was no king in Israel , but every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and the man depar@@ ted out of the city from B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h to so@@ jour@@ n where he could find a place : and he came to mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he jour@@ ne@@ yed .
and the Lev@@ ite was content to d@@ well with the man ; and the young man was un@@ to him as one of his sons .
and Mic@@ ah consec@@ rated the Lev@@ ite ; and the young man became his pri@@ est , and was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes sought them an inher@@ it@@ ance to d@@ well in ; for un@@ to that day all their inher@@ it@@ ance had not fallen un@@ to them among the tri@@ bes of Israel .
and they said un@@ to him , As@@ k coun@@ sel , we pra@@ y the@@ e , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
and they said , arise , that we may go up against them : for we have seen the land , and , be@@ hold , it is very good : and are ye still ? be not slo@@ th@@ ful to go , and to enter to poss@@ ess the land .
when ye go , ye shall come un@@ to a people secure , and to a large land : for God hat@@ h given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the ear@@ th .
and there went from th@@ ence of the family of the Dani@@ tes , out of Zor@@ ah and out of E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war .
and they turned th@@ i@@ ther@@ ward , and came to the house of the young man the Lev@@ ite , even un@@ to the house of Mic@@ ah , and sal@@ uted him .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and the pri@@ est 's heart was glad , and he took the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the Gra@@ ven image , and went in the mid@@ st of the people .
and when they were a good way from the house of Mic@@ ah , the men that were in the houses near to Mic@@ ah 's house were gathered together , and over@@ took the children of Dan .
and the children of Dan said un@@ to him , Let not TH@@ Y voice be heard among us , lest angry fel@@ lows run upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou lose TH@@ Y life , with the lives of TH@@ Y household .
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back un@@ to his house .
and they took the things which Mic@@ ah had made , and the pri@@ est which he had , and came un@@ to La@@ ish , un@@ to a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , and bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born un@@ to Israel : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the Gra@@ ven image : and Jon@@ athan , the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , he and his sons were pri@@ ests to the tri@@ be of Dan until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
and it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Lev@@ ite so@@ jour@@ ning on the side of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , who took to him a conc@@ ub@@ ine out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h .
and his father in law , the dam@@ sel 's father , re@@ tained him ; and he abo@@ de with him three days : so they did eat and drink , and lo@@ d@@ ged there .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , that he rose up to de@@ part : and the dam@@ sel 's father said un@@ to his son in law , Com@@ for@@ t th@@ ine heart with a mor@@ sel of bread , and after@@ ward go your way .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the dam@@ sel 's father had said un@@ to the man , Be content , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and tar@@ ry all night , and let th@@ ine heart be mer@@ ry .
and he ar@@ ose early in the morning on the fifth day to de@@ part : and the dam@@ sel 's father said , Com@@ for@@ t th@@ ine heart , I pra@@ y the@@ e . and they tar@@ ried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jer@@ usalem ; and there were with him two ass@@ es s@@ add@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said un@@ to his master , C@@ ome , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and let us turn in into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it .
and his master said un@@ to him , We will not turn aside hi@@ ther into the city of a st@@ ran@@ ger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gi@@ be@@ ah , which belon@@ get@@ h to Benjamin .
and they turned aside th@@ ither , to go in and to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lo@@ d@@ ging .
and , be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he so@@ jour@@ ned in Gi@@ be@@ ah : but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city : and the old man said , W@@ hi@@ ther go@@ est th@@ ou ? and wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou ?
yet there is both stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for our ass@@ es ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id , and for the young man which is with TH@@ Y servants : there is no want of any thing .
so he brought him into his house , and gave pro@@ ven@@ der un@@ to the ass@@ es : and they was@@ hed their feet , and did eat and drink .
then came the woman in the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lor@@ d was , ti@@ ll it was light .
and her lor@@ d rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , be@@ hold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and he said un@@ to her , Up , and let us be going . but none answ@@ ered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and g@@ at him un@@ to his place .
and when he was come into his house , he took a k@@ ni@@ fe , and laid hold on his conc@@ ub@@ ine , and divided her , together with her b@@ ones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the co@@ asts of Israel .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation was gathered together as one man , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , with the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to the Lord in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand foot@@ men that drew s@@ word .
and the Lev@@ ite , the husband of the woman that was sla@@ in , answ@@ ered and said , I came into Gi@@ be@@ ah that belon@@ get@@ h to Benjamin , I and my conc@@ ub@@ ine , to lo@@ dge .
and the men of Gi@@ be@@ ah rose against me , and bes@@ et the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have sla@@ in me : and my conc@@ ub@@ ine have they forced , that she is dead .
and I took my conc@@ ub@@ ine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inher@@ it@@ ance of Israel : for they have committed le@@ w@@ d@@ ness and Fol@@ ly in Israel .
and all the people ar@@ ose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gi@@ be@@ ah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Bel@@ ial , which are in Gi@@ be@@ ah , that we may put them to death , and put away ev@@ il from Israel . but the children of Benjamin would not he@@ arken to the voice of their bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel :
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities un@@ to Gi@@ be@@ ah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel ar@@ ose , and went up to the house of God , and asked coun@@ sel of God , and said , Wh@@ ich of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? and the Lord said , Ju@@ da@@ h shall go up first .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gi@@ be@@ ah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gi@@ be@@ ah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again E@@ igh@@ teen thousand men ; all these drew the s@@ word .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came un@@ to the house of God , and we@@ pt , and sat there before the Lord , and fas@@ ted that day until even , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before the Lord .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were s@@ mit@@ ten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benj@@ am@@ ites , because they tr@@ usted un@@ to the liers in wait which they had set bes@@ ide Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the liers in wait has@@ ted , and rushed upon Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smo@@ te all the city with the edge of the s@@ word .
now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great fla@@ me with smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the fla@@ me began to arise up out of the city with a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them , and , be@@ hold , the fla@@ me of the city as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en .
and when the men of Israel turned again , the men of Benjamin were amaz@@ ed : for they saw that ev@@ il was come upon them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel un@@ to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle over@@ took them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the mid@@ st of them .
and the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , as well the men of every city , as the be@@ ast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
and the people came to the house of God , and abo@@ de there ti@@ ll even before God , and lifted up their voices , and we@@ pt sor@@ e ;
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that the people rose early , and built there an alt@@ ar , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings .
and they said , What one is there of the tri@@ bes of Israel that came not up to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h to the Lord ? and , be@@ hold , there came none to the camp from J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad to the assembly .
for the people were num@@ ber@@ ed , and , be@@ hold , there were none of the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad there .
and they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them un@@ to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock R@@ im@@ mon , and to call peac@@ e@@ ably un@@ to them .
and they said , There must be an inher@@ it@@ ance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tri@@ be be not destroyed out of Israel .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it we may not give them wi@@ ves of our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cur@@ sed be he that gi@@ vet@@ h a wife to Benjamin .
then they said , be@@ hold , there is a feast of the Lord in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h ye@@ arly in a place which is on the north side of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that go@@ eth up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of L@@ eb@@ on@@ ah .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of them that dan@@ ced , whom they caught : and they went and returned un@@ to their inher@@ it@@ ance , and rep@@ aired the cities , and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and the children of Israel depar@@ ted th@@ ence at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from th@@ ence every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
then she ar@@ ose with her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law , that she might return from the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : for she had heard in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return un@@ to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Na@@ om@@ i said un@@ to her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law , G@@ o , return each to her mother 's house : the Lord deal kin@@ dly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she k@@ is@@ sed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
turn again , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . if I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
so they two went until they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . and it came to pass , when they were come to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Na@@ om@@ i ?
so Na@@ om@@ i returned , and R@@ ut@@ h the Mo@@ abi@@ tes@@ s , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : and they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem in the beginning of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est .
and she went , and came , and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and her ha@@ p was to light on a part of the field belonging un@@ to Bo@@ az , who was of the kin@@ d@@ red of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and be@@ hold , Bo@@ az came from B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said un@@ to the re@@ apers , The Lord be with you . and they answ@@ ered him , The Lord b@@ less the@@ e .
then she fell on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y have I found grace in th@@ ine eyes , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a st@@ ran@@ ger ?
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
was@@ h th@@ y@@ self therefore , and ano@@ int the@@ e , and put TH@@ Y ra@@ im@@ ent upon the@@ e , and get the@@ e down to the floor : but make not th@@ y@@ self known un@@ to the man , until he shall have done e@@ ating and drinking .
and she went down un@@ to the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law b@@ ade her .
and it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himself : and , be@@ hold , a woman lay at his feet .
and now , my daughter , fear not ; I will do to the@@ e all that th@@ ou requi@@ rest : for all the city of my people do@@ th know that th@@ ou art a vir@@ tu@@ ous woman .
and he said un@@ to the k@@ ins@@ man , Na@@ om@@ i , that is come again out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b , sel@@ le@@ th a par@@ cel of land , which was our brother Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's :
and Bo@@ az said un@@ to the el@@ ders , and un@@ to all the people , Y@@ e are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's , and all that was Ch@@ il@@ ion 's and Mah@@ lon 's , of the hand of Na@@ om@@ i .
and let TH@@ Y house be like the house of P@@ har@@ ez , whom Tam@@ ar b@@ are un@@ to Ju@@ da@@ h , of the se@@ ed which the Lord shall give the@@ e of this young woman .
and he shall be un@@ to the@@ e a re@@ sto@@ rer of TH@@ Y life , and a no@@ ur@@ is@@ her of th@@ ine old age : for TH@@ Y daughter in law , which lov@@ eth the@@ e , which is better to the@@ e than seven sons , hat@@ h born him .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim @@@ -@@ @ z@@ op@@ him , of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of To@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite :
and he had two wi@@ ves ; the name of the one was H@@ ann@@ ah , and the name of the other Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah : and Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah had children , but H@@ ann@@ ah had no children .
and when the time was that El@@ kan@@ ah offered , he gave to Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah his wife , and to all her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , por@@ tions :
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the Lord , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and did not eat .
so H@@ ann@@ ah rose up after they had e@@ aten in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and after they had dr@@ un@@ k . now E@@ li the pri@@ est sat upon a seat by a post of the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and they rose up in the morning early , and wor@@ shi@@ pped before the Lord , and returned , and came to their house to Ram@@ ah : and El@@ kan@@ ah knew H@@ ann@@ ah his wife ; and the Lord remember@@ ed her .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it came to pass , when the time was come about after H@@ ann@@ ah had conce@@ ived , that she b@@ are a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Bec@@ ause I have asked him of the Lord .
and the man El@@ kan@@ ah , and all his house , went up to offer un@@ to the Lord the ye@@ arly sacrifice , and his vo@@ w .
but H@@ ann@@ ah went not up ; for she said un@@ to her husband , I will not go up until the child be we@@ an@@ ed , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the Lord , and there abide for ever .
and when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ loc@@ ks , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of fl@@ our , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him un@@ to the house of the Lord in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h : and the child was young .
talk no more so exceeding pro@@ u@@ dly ; let not ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy come out of your m@@ outh : for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hun@@ gry ce@@ ased : so that the bar@@ ren hat@@ h born seven ; and she that hat@@ h many children is wa@@ xed fe@@ e@@ ble .
the ad@@ vers@@ aries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heav@@ en shall he Th@@ under upon them : the Lord shall judge the ends of the ear@@ th ; and he shall give strength un@@ to his king , and ex@@ alt the Hor@@ n of his ano@@ in@@ ted .
and he struck it into the pan , or ket@@ tle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or po@@ t ; all that the fle@@ sh@@ ho@@ ok brought up the pri@@ est took for himself . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h un@@ to all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that came th@@ ither .
moreover his mother made him a little co@@ at , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the ye@@ arly sacrifice .
now E@@ li was very old , and heard all that his sons did un@@ to all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assemb@@ led at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off th@@ ine arm , and the arm of TH@@ Y father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt see an enemy in my habi@@ tation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house for ever .
and this shall be a sign un@@ to the@@ e , that shall come upon TH@@ Y two sons , on H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine ano@@ in@@ ted for ever .
and it came to pass at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wa@@ x dim , that he could not see ;
and ER@@ E the lam@@ p of God went out in the temp@@ le of the Lord , where the Ar@@ k of God was , and Samuel was laid down to sle@@ ep ;
and the Lord said to Samuel , be@@ hold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the e@@ ars of every one that he@@ aret@@ h it shall t@@ ing@@ le .
in that day I will perform against E@@ li all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was s@@ mit@@ ten before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and they sle@@ w of the army in the field about four thousand men .
so the people sent to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , that they might bring from th@@ ence the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord of hosts , which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms : and the two sons of E@@ li , H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has , were there with the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God .
and when the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel sh@@ ou@@ ted with a great sh@@ out , so that the ear@@ th ran@@ g again .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out , they said , What mean@@ eth the no@@ ise of this great sh@@ out in the camp of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ? and they understood that the Ar@@ k of the Lord was come into the camp .
Wo@@ e un@@ to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these m@@ igh@@ ty go@@ ds ? these are the go@@ ds that smo@@ te the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans with all the plagu@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought , and Israel was s@@ mit@@ ten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great sla@@ ughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot@@ men .
and there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h the same day with his clo@@ th@@ es rent , and with ear@@ th upon his head .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said un@@ to her , Fe@@ ar not ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast born a son . but she answ@@ ered not , neither did she regard it .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took the Ar@@ k of God , they brought it into the house of D@@ agon , and set it by D@@ agon .
and when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the mor@@ row , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen upon his face to the ear@@ th before the Ar@@ k of the Lord . and they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
and when the men of Ash@@ do@@ d saw that it was so , they said , The Ar@@ k of the God of Israel shall not abide with us : for his hand is sor@@ e upon us , and upon D@@ agon our go@@ d .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smo@@ te the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emer@@ ods in their secret parts .
and the men that died not were s@@ mit@@ ten with the emer@@ ods : and the cry of the city went up to heav@@ en .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines called for the pri@@ ests and the di@@ vin@@ ers , saying , What shall we do to the Ar@@ k of the Lord ? tell us where@@ with we shall send it to his place .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ye shall make images of your emer@@ ods , and images of your m@@ ice that mar the land ; and ye shall give gl@@ ory un@@ to the God of Israel : per@@ ad@@ venture he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your go@@ ds , and from off your land .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore then do ye har@@ den your hear@@ ts , as the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and P@@ har@@ o@@ ah har@@ dened their hear@@ ts ? when he had w@@ rought won@@ der@@ fully among them , did they not let the people go , and they depar@@ ted ?
now therefore make a new c@@ art , and take two mil@@ ch k@@ ine , on which there hat@@ h come no yok@@ e , and tie the k@@ ine to the c@@ art , and bring their cal@@ ves home from them :
and they laid the Ar@@ k of the Lord upon the c@@ art , and the co@@ ffer with the m@@ ice of gold and the images of their emer@@ ods .
and the k@@ ine took the stra@@ ight way to the way of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went along the highway , low@@ ing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went after them un@@ to the border of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h .
and they of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
and the c@@ art came into the field of Jos@@ hua , a Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ em@@ ite , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they cla@@ ve the wood of the c@@ art , and offered the k@@ ine a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes took down the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the co@@ ffer that was with it , where@@ in the je@@ wel@@ s of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the same day un@@ to the Lord .
and these are the golden emer@@ ods which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines returned for a t@@ res@@ pass offering un@@ to the Lord ; for Ash@@ do@@ d one , for Gaza one , for As@@ k@@ el@@ on one , for G@@ ath one , for E@@ kr@@ on one ;
and the men of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im came , and f@@ et@@ ched up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and brought it into the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b in the hill , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Ele@@ azar his son to keep the Ar@@ k of the Lord .
and it came to pass , while the Ar@@ k abo@@ de in Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamen@@ ted after the Lord .
and they gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and drew water , and p@@ oured it out before the Lord , and fas@@ ted on that day , and said there , We have sin@@ ned against the Lord . and Samuel jud@@ ged the children of Israel in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , ce@@ ase not to cry un@@ to the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and as Samuel was offering up the bur@@ n@@ t offering , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines drew near to battle against Israel : but the Lord th@@ under@@ ed with a great Th@@ under on that day upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted them ; and they were s@@ mit@@ ten before Israel .
and the men of Israel went out of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and smo@@ te them , until they came under Beth @@@ -@@ @ car .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were sub@@ du@@ ed , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
and it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
now the name of his fir@@ st@@ born was Jo@@ el ; and the name of his second , A@@ bi@@ ah : they were judges in Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and the Lord said un@@ to Samuel , Hear@@ ken un@@ to the voice of the people in all that they say un@@ to the@@ e : for they have not rejected the@@ e , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even un@@ to this day , where@@ with they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also un@@ to the@@ e .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his char@@ i@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ se@@ men ; and some shall run before his char@@ i@@ ots .
and he will take your fields , and your v@@ ine@@ yards , and your ol@@ i@@ ve@@ yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
and he will take the tenth of your se@@ ed , and of your v@@ ine@@ yards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your men@@ servants , and your ma@@ id@@ servants , and your good@@ li@@ est young men , and your ass@@ es , and put them to his work .
and Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he re@@ hear@@ sed them in the e@@ ars of the Lord .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of B@@ ech@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of power .
and he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , a choice young man , and a good@@ ly : and there was not among the children of Israel a good@@ lier person than he : from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
and when they were come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant that was with him , C@@ ome , and let us return ; lest my father leave car@@ ing for the ass@@ es , and take thought for us .
( Be@@ fore@@ time in Israel , when a man went to inqu@@ ire of God , thus he sp@@ ake , C@@ ome , and let us go to the se@@ er : for he that is now called a Pro@@ phe@@ t was be@@ fore@@ time called a Se@@ er . )
and they answ@@ ered them , and said , He is ; be@@ hold , he is before you : make has@@ te now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , be@@ hold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and as for th@@ ine ass@@ es that were lost three days ago , set not TH@@ Y mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on the@@ e , and on all TH@@ Y father 's house ?
and Samuel took Sa@@ ul and his ser@@ vant , and brought them into the par@@ l@@ our , and made them sit in the chi@@ ef@@ est place among them that were bid@@ den , which were about thirty persons .
and when they were come down from the high place into the city , Samuel commun@@ ed with Sa@@ ul upon the top of the house .
and they ar@@ ose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Sa@@ ul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send the@@ e away . and Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took a vi@@ al of oil , and p@@ oured it upon his head , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and said , Is it not because the Lord hat@@ h ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e to be captain over his inher@@ it@@ ance ?
and let it be , when these signs are come un@@ to the@@ e , that th@@ ou do as occasion serve the@@ e ; for God is with the@@ e .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him be@@ fore@@ time saw that , be@@ hold , he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied among the pro@@ ph@@ ets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come un@@ to the son of K@@ ish ? is Sa@@ ul also among the pro@@ ph@@ ets ?
and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to his un@@ cle , He told us pla@@ in@@ ly that the ass@@ es were found . but of the matter of the k@@ ing@@ dom , where@@ of Samuel sp@@ ake , he told him not .
when he had caused the tri@@ be of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Mat@@ ri was taken , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
and they ran and f@@ et@@ ched him th@@ ence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then came the mes@@ sen@@ gers to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul , and told the ti@@ dings in the e@@ ars of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and we@@ pt .
and Samuel said un@@ to the people , It is the Lord that advanced Mos@@ es and Aaron , and that brought your fa@@ thers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and to your fa@@ thers .
when Jac@@ o@@ b was come into Egypt , and your fa@@ thers cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , then the Lord sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , which brought forth your fa@@ thers out of Egypt , and made them d@@ well in this place .
and when they for@@ g@@ at the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sis@@ era , captain of the host of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and they fought against them .
and they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , We have sin@@ ned , because we have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , and have served Ba@@ al@@ im and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enem@@ ies , and we will serve the@@ e .
and when ye saw that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon came against you , ye said un@@ to me , N@@ ay ; but a king shall reign over us : when the Lord your God was your king .
now therefore be@@ hold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desi@@ red ! and , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h set a king over you .
if ye will fear the Lord , and serve him , and obe@@ y his voice , and not rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , then shall both ye and also the king that re@@ ig@@ net@@ h over you continue following the Lord your God :
but if ye will not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fa@@ thers .
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after v@@ ain things , which can@@ not profit nor deliver ; for they are v@@ ain .
for the Lord will not for@@ sake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hat@@ h pleased the Lord to make you his people .
and all Israel heard say that Sa@@ ul had s@@ mit@@ ten a gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and that Israel also was had in ab@@ omin@@ ation with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the people were called together after Sa@@ ul to G@@ ilg@@ al .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and six thousand hor@@ se@@ men , and people as the s@@ and which is on the sea shore in multi@@ tude : and they came up , and pit@@ ched in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , eas@@ tw@@ ard from Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it , ( for the people were dist@@ ressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in high places , and in p@@ its .
and some of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws went over Jordan to the land of G@@ ad and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . as for Sa@@ ul , he was yet in G@@ ilg@@ al , and all the people followed him tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might sal@@ ute him .
and Samuel said to Sa@@ ul , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly : th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord TH@@ Y God , which he comman@@ ded the@@ e : for now would the Lord have established TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom upon Israel for ever .
but now TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom shall not continue : the Lord hat@@ h sought him a man after his own heart , and the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded him to be captain over his people , because th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept that which the Lord comman@@ ded the@@ e .
and Sa@@ ul , and Jon@@ athan his son , and the people that were present with them , abo@@ de in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin : but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines en@@ camp@@ ed in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h .
and the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned un@@ to the way that le@@ ade@@ th to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , un@@ to the land of Sh@@ ual :
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither s@@ word nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan : but with Sa@@ ul and with Jon@@ athan his son was there found .
now it came to pass upon a day , that Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul said un@@ to the young man that b@@ are his arm@@ our , C@@ ome , and let us go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
and Sa@@ ul tar@@ ried in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of Gi@@ be@@ ah under a po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree which is in Mig@@ ron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
and A@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , I @@@ -@@ @ cha@@ bo@@ d 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of E@@ li , the Lord 's pri@@ est in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . and the people knew not that Jon@@ athan was gone .
and between the passa@@ ges , by which Jon@@ athan sought to go over un@@ to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Boz@@ ez , and the name of the other Sen@@ e@@ h .
if they say thus un@@ to us , Tar@@ ry until we come to you ; then we will stand still in our place , and will not go up un@@ to them .
and both of them discovered themselves un@@ to the gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , be@@ hold , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws come forth out of the ho@@ les where they had hi@@ d themselves .
and that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half ac@@ re of land , which a yok@@ e of ox@@ en might plo@@ w .
and the watch@@ men of Sa@@ ul in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin looked ; and , be@@ hold , the multi@@ tude mel@@ ted away , and they went on beating down one another .
and it came to pass , while Sa@@ ul talked un@@ to the pri@@ est , that the no@@ ise that was in the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to the pri@@ est , With@@ draw th@@ ine hand .
and Sa@@ ul and all the people that were with him assemb@@ led themselves , and they came to the battle : and , be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow , and there was a very great dis@@ com@@ f@@ it@@ ure .
moreover the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hi@@ d themselves in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jon@@ athan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : where@@ fore he put forth the end of the ro@@ d that was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and put his hand to his m@@ outh ; and his eyes were en@@ ligh@@ tened .
how much more , if hap@@ ly the people had e@@ aten freely to day of the sp@@ oil of their enem@@ ies which they found ? for had there not been now a much greater sla@@ ughter among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
and the people fle@@ w upon the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
so Sa@@ ul took the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel , and fought against all his enem@@ ies on every side , against Mo@@ a@@ b , and against the children of Am@@ mon , and against E@@ dom , and against the kings of Z@@ ob@@ ah , and against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he turned himself , he v@@ ex@@ ed them .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ u@@ i , and Mel@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a : and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these ; the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am , the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az : and the name of the captain of his host was Ab@@ ner , the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
and there was sor@@ e war against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Sa@@ ul : and when Sa@@ ul saw any strong man , or any val@@ i@@ ant man , he took him un@@ to him .
Samuel also said un@@ to Sa@@ ul , The Lord sent me to ano@@ int the@@ e to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore he@@ arken th@@ ou un@@ to the voice of the words of the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , I remember that which A@@ mal@@ ek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the way , when he came up from Egypt .
and he took A@@ ga@@ g the king of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites alive , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the people with the edge of the s@@ word .
it re@@ pen@@ te@@ th me that I have set up Sa@@ ul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hat@@ h not performed my comman@@ d@@ ments . and it gri@@ ev@@ ed Samuel ; and he cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord all night .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and , be@@ hold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to G@@ ilg@@ al .
and Samuel said un@@ to him , The Lord hat@@ h rent the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel from the@@ e this day , and hat@@ h given it to a neighbour of th@@ ine , that is better than th@@ ou .
and Samuel said , As TH@@ Y s@@ word hat@@ h made women ch@@ ild@@ less , so shall TH@@ Y mother be ch@@ ild@@ less among women . and Samuel he@@ wed A@@ ga@@ g in pieces before the Lord in G@@ ilg@@ al .
then Samuel took the Hor@@ n of oil , and ano@@ in@@ ted him in the mid@@ st of his bre@@ th@@ ren : and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ram@@ ah .
and Sa@@ ul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pit@@ ched by the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , and set the battle in array against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a val@@ ley between them .
and he had an hel@@ met of br@@ ass upon his head , and he was armed with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
and the staff of his spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am ; and his spe@@ ar 's head weighed six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h , whose name was J@@ es@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Sa@@ ul .
and the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se went and followed Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next un@@ to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
now Sa@@ ul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , fighting with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and David left his carri@@ age in the hand of the keep@@ er of the carri@@ age , and ran into the army , and came and sal@@ uted his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and as he talked with them , be@@ hold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , Gol@@ i@@ ath by name , out of the armies of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sp@@ ake according to the same words : and David heard them .
and all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sor@@ e afraid .
and he turned from him toward another , and sp@@ ake after the same manner : and the people answ@@ ered him again after the former manner .
and when the words were heard which David sp@@ ake , they re@@ hear@@ sed them before Sa@@ ul : and he sent for him .
and Sa@@ ul said to David , T@@ ho@@ u art not able to go against this Phil@@ ist@@ ine to fight with him : for th@@ ou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
David said moreover , The Lord that delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to David , G@@ o , and the Lord be with the@@ e .
and Sa@@ ul armed David with his arm@@ our , and he put an hel@@ met of br@@ ass upon his head ; also he armed him with a co@@ at of mail .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the Bro@@ ok , and put them in a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's bag which he had , even in a s@@ cri@@ p ; and his s@@ ling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine came on and drew near un@@ to David ; and the man that b@@ are the shield went before him .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine looked about , and saw David , he dis@@ da@@ ined him : for he was but a youth , and ru@@ d@@ dy , and of a fair coun@@ tenance .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine said to David , C@@ ome to me , and I will give TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air , and to the be@@ asts of the field .
and it came to pass , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine ar@@ ose , and came and drew n@@ igh to meet David , that David has@@ ted , and ran toward the army to meet the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took th@@ ence a stone , and s@@ lan@@ g it , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head , that the stone sun@@ k into his fore@@ head ; and he fell upon his face to the ear@@ th .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his s@@ word , and drew it out of the she@@ ath there@@ of , and sle@@ w him , and cut off his head there@@ with . and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and as David returned from the sla@@ ughter of the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , Ab@@ ner took him , and brought him before Sa@@ ul with the head of the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his hand .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking un@@ to Sa@@ ul , that the sou@@ l of Jon@@ athan was k@@ n@@ it with the sou@@ l of David , and Jon@@ athan lov@@ ed him as his own sou@@ l .
and Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his gar@@ ments , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his gir@@ dle .
and Sa@@ ul comman@@ ded his servants , saying , Commun@@ e with David secre@@ tly , and say , be@@ hold , the king hat@@ h de@@ light in the@@ e , and all his servants love the@@ e : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and Sa@@ ul 's servants sp@@ ake those words in the e@@ ars of David . and David said , Se@@ eme@@ th it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed ?
and when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son in law : and the days were not expired .
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was much set by .
and I will go out and stand bes@@ ide my father in the field where th@@ ou art , and I will commun@@ e with my father of the@@ e ; and what I see , that I will tell the@@ e .
and Sa@@ ul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the j@@ av@@ elin ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the j@@ av@@ elin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
Sa@@ ul also sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to David 's house , to watch him , and to s@@ lay him in the morning : and Mic@@ hal David 's wife told him , saying , If th@@ ou save not TH@@ Y life to night , to mor@@ row th@@ ou s@@ halt be sla@@ in .
and Mic@@ hal took an image , and laid it in the bed , and put a pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir for his bolster , and covered it with a clo@@ th .
and when the mes@@ sen@@ gers were come in , be@@ hold , there was an image in the bed , with a pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir for his bolster .
and he went th@@ ither to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah : and the Spiri@@ t of God was upon him also , and he went on , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , until he came to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt deal kin@@ dly with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast brought TH@@ Y ser@@ vant into a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord with the@@ e : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , if there be in me in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , s@@ lay me th@@ y@@ self ; for why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou bring me to TH@@ Y father ?
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not only while yet I live she@@ w me the kin@@ d@@ ness of the Lord , that I die not :
but also th@@ ou s@@ halt not cut off TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hat@@ h cut off the enem@@ ies of David every one from the face of the ear@@ th .
and when th@@ ou h@@ ast stayed three days , then th@@ ou s@@ halt go down quickly , and come to the place where th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st hide th@@ y@@ self when the business was in hand , and s@@ halt remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of J@@ es@@ se li@@ vet@@ h upon the ground , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be established , nor TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom . W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now send and f@@ et@@ ch him un@@ to me , for he shall su@@ rely die .
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jon@@ athan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little la@@ d with him .
and when the la@@ d was come to the place of the ar@@ row which Jon@@ athan had shot , Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the la@@ d , and said , Is not the ar@@ row beyond the@@ e ?
and Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the la@@ d , Mak@@ e speed , has@@ te , stay not . and Jon@@ athan 's la@@ d gathered up the ar@@ ro@@ ws , and came to his master .
and as soon as the la@@ d was gone , David ar@@ ose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bo@@ wed himself three times : and they k@@ is@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , until David exceeded .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g , an E@@ dom@@ ite , the chi@@ ef@@ est of the her@@ d@@ men that belonged to Sa@@ ul .
and David ar@@ ose , and fled that day for fear of Sa@@ ul , and went to A@@ ch@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
and the servants of A@@ ch@@ ish said un@@ to him , Is not this David the king of the land ? did they not sing one to another of him in dan@@ ces , saying , Sa@@ ul hat@@ h sla@@ in his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
David therefore depar@@ ted th@@ ence , and escaped to the cave Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and when his bre@@ th@@ ren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down th@@ ither to him .
and every one that was in dist@@ ress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was dis@@ conten@@ ted , gathered themselves un@@ to him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
when Sa@@ ul heard that David was discovered , and the men that were with him , ( now Sa@@ ul abo@@ de in Gi@@ be@@ ah under a tree in Ram@@ ah , having his spe@@ ar in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ; )
then Sa@@ ul said un@@ to his servants that stood about him , He@@ ar now , ye Benj@@ am@@ ites ; will the son of J@@ es@@ se give every one of you fields and v@@ ine@@ yards , and make you all cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds ;
then the king sent to call A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the pri@@ est , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and all his father 's house , the pri@@ ests that were in No@@ b : and they came all of them to the king .
and No@@ b , the city of the pri@@ ests , smo@@ te he with the edge of the s@@ word , both men and women , children and su@@ ck@@ lings , and ox@@ en , and ass@@ es , and she@@ ep , with the edge of the s@@ word .
so David and his men went to Ke@@ il@@ ah , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brought away their c@@ attle , and smo@@ te them with a great sla@@ ughter . so David sav@@ ed the inhabitants of Ke@@ il@@ ah .
and it came to pass , when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the son of A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fled to David to Ke@@ il@@ ah , that he came down with an ep@@ ho@@ d in his hand .
then David and his men , which were about six hundred , ar@@ ose and depar@@ ted out of Ke@@ il@@ ah , and went w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever they could go . and it was told Sa@@ ul that David was escaped from Ke@@ il@@ ah ; and he for@@ b@@ are to go forth .
and David abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in strong holds , and remained in a mountain in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h . and Sa@@ ul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
and David saw that Sa@@ ul was come out to seek his life : and David was in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h in a wood .
and he said un@@ to him , Fe@@ ar not : for the hand of Sa@@ ul my father shall not find the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be king over Israel , and I shall be next un@@ to the@@ e ; and that also Sa@@ ul my father know@@ eth .
then came up the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , Do@@ th not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of J@@ es@@ him@@ on ?
now therefore , O king , come down according to all the desire of TH@@ Y sou@@ l to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king 's hand .
go , I pra@@ y you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his ha@@ un@@ t is , and who hat@@ h seen him there : for it is told me that he deal@@ eth very sub@@ til@@ ly .
and they ar@@ ose , and went to Z@@ ip@@ h before Sa@@ ul : but David and his men were in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on , in the pla@@ in on the south of J@@ es@@ him@@ on .
Sa@@ ul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : where@@ fore he came down into a rock , and abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . and when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed after David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
and Sa@@ ul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made has@@ te to get away for fear of Sa@@ ul ; for Sa@@ ul and his men comp@@ ass@@ ed David and his men round about to take them .
and it came to pass , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
and he came to the she@@ ep@@ co@@ tes by the way , where was a cave ; and Sa@@ ul went in to cover his feet : and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
and it came to pass after@@ ward , that David 's heart smo@@ te him , because he had cut off Sa@@ ul 's sk@@ ir@@ t .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Sa@@ ul . but Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also ar@@ ose after@@ ward , and went out of the cave , and cri@@ ed after Sa@@ ul , saying , My lor@@ d the king . and when Sa@@ ul looked behind him , David sto@@ op@@ ed with his face to the ear@@ th , and bo@@ wed himself .
and it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words un@@ to Sa@@ ul , that Sa@@ ul said , Is this TH@@ Y voice , my son David ? and Sa@@ ul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed this day how that th@@ ou h@@ ast dealt well with me : for@@ as@@ much as when the Lord had delivered me into th@@ ine hand , th@@ ou kil@@ led@@ st me not .
for if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? where@@ fore the Lord reward the@@ e good for that th@@ ou h@@ ast done un@@ to me this day .
and now , be@@ hold , I know well that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely be king , and that the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel shall be established in th@@ ine hand .
swe@@ ar now therefore un@@ to me by the Lord , that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and Samuel died ; and all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes were gathered together , and lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in his house at Ram@@ ah . and David ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an .
and there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful coun@@ tenance : but the man was chur@@ lish and ev@@ il in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ e@@ b .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said un@@ to the young men , G@@ et you up to Car@@ mel , and go to Nab@@ al , and gre@@ et him in my name :
and thus shall ye say to him that li@@ vet@@ h in prosperity , Peace be both to the@@ e , and peace be to th@@ ine house , and peace be un@@ to all that th@@ ou h@@ ast .
and now I have heard that th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ hear@@ ers : now TH@@ Y she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing un@@ to them , all the while they were in Car@@ mel .
and when David 's young men came , they sp@@ ake to Nab@@ al according to all those words in the name of David , and ce@@ ased .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my f@@ les@@ h that I have killed for my s@@ hear@@ ers , and give it un@@ to men , whom I know not wh@@ ence they be ?
but the men were very good un@@ to us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conver@@ san@@ t with them , when we were in the fields :
they were a wall un@@ to us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the she@@ ep .
and it was so , as she ro@@ de on the ass , that she came down by the cover@@ t of the hill , and , be@@ hold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
and when A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il saw David , she has@@ ted , and ligh@@ ted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground ,
and fell at his feet , and said , U@@ p@@ on me , my lor@@ d , upon me let this in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity be : and let th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak in th@@ ine audience , and hear the words of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id .
and now this b@@ les@@ sing which th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id hat@@ h brought un@@ to my lor@@ d , let it even be given un@@ to the young men that follow my lor@@ d .
I pra@@ y the@@ e , for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id : for the Lord will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house ; because my lor@@ d figh@@ te@@ th the batt@@ les of the Lord , and ev@@ il hat@@ h not been found in the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
yet a man is risen to pursue the@@ e , and to seek TH@@ Y sou@@ l : but the sou@@ l of my lor@@ d shall be bound in the bun@@ dle of life with the Lord TH@@ Y God ; and the so@@ ul@@ s of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , them shall he s@@ ling out , as out of the middle of a s@@ ling .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he hat@@ h spoken concerning the@@ e , and shall have appointed the@@ e ru@@ ler over Israel ;
that this shall be no gri@@ ef un@@ to the@@ e , nor off@@ ence of heart un@@ to my lor@@ d , either that th@@ ou h@@ ast shed blood ca@@ us@@ ele@@ ss , or that my lor@@ d hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged himself : but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lor@@ d , then remember th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id .
and b@@ les@@ sed be TH@@ Y advice , and b@@ les@@ sed be th@@ ou , which h@@ ast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from av@@ eng@@ ing myself with mine own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said un@@ to her , G@@ o up in peace to th@@ ine house ; see , I have hear@@ ken@@ ed to TH@@ Y voice , and have accepted TH@@ Y person .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il came to Nab@@ al ; and , be@@ hold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nab@@ al 's heart was mer@@ ry within him , for he was very dr@@ un@@ ken : where@@ fore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and when the servants of David were come to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il to Car@@ mel , they sp@@ ake un@@ to her , saying , David sent us un@@ to the@@ e to take the@@ e to him to wife .
and she ar@@ ose , and bo@@ wed her@@ self on her face to the ear@@ th , and said , be@@ hold , let th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id be a ser@@ vant to was@@ h the feet of the servants of my lor@@ d .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il has@@ ted , and ar@@ ose , and ro@@ de upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the mes@@ sen@@ gers of David , and became his wife .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
and Sa@@ ul pit@@ ched in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before J@@ es@@ him@@ on , by the way . but David abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and David ar@@ ose , and came to the place where Sa@@ ul had pit@@ ched : and David be@@ held the place where Sa@@ ul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his host : and Sa@@ ul lay in the tren@@ ch , and the people pit@@ ched round about him .
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul lay sle@@ eping within the tren@@ ch , and his spe@@ ar st@@ uck in the ground at his bolster : but Ab@@ ner and the people lay round about him .
the Lord for@@ bid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's ano@@ in@@ ted : but , I pra@@ y the@@ e , take th@@ ou now the spe@@ ar that is at his bolster , and the cr@@ use of water , and let us go .
and he said , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do@@ th my lor@@ d thus pursue after his ser@@ vant ? for what have I done ? or what ev@@ il is in mine hand ?
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the ear@@ th before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one do@@ th hunt a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains .
the Lord ren@@ der to every man his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and his fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness : for the Lord delivered the@@ e into my hand to day , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's ano@@ in@@ ted .
and , be@@ hold , as TH@@ Y life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tri@@ bu@@ lation .
and David ar@@ ose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him un@@ to A@@ ch@@ ish , the son of Ma@@ o@@ ch , king of G@@ ath .
and David d@@ wel@@ t with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
and the time that David d@@ wel@@ t in the country of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was a full year and four months .
and David smo@@ te the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en , and the ass@@ es , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , and the appar@@ el , and returned , and came to A@@ ch@@ ish .
and it came to pass in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for war@@ fare , to fight with Israel . and A@@ ch@@ ish said un@@ to David , K@@ now th@@ ou assu@@ red@@ ly , that th@@ ou s@@ halt go out with me to battle , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y men .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . and Sa@@ ul had put away those that had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
and when Sa@@ ul saw the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly tre@@ m@@ b@@ led .
and the woman said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ou know@@ est what Sa@@ ul hat@@ h done , how he hat@@ h cut off those that have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land : where@@ fore then lay@@ est th@@ ou a sn@@ are for my life , to cause me to die ?
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice : and the woman sp@@ ake to Sa@@ ul , saying , Wh@@ y h@@ ast th@@ ou dec@@ e@@ ived me ? for th@@ ou art Sa@@ ul .
and the Lord hat@@ h done to him , as he sp@@ ake by me : for the Lord hat@@ h rent the k@@ ing@@ dom out of th@@ ine hand , and given it to TH@@ Y neighbour , even to David :
moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with the@@ e into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and to mor@@ row s@@ halt th@@ ou and TH@@ Y sons be with me : the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
then Sa@@ ul fell stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay all along on the ear@@ th , and was sor@@ e afraid , because of the words of Samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
and the woman came un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and saw that he was sor@@ e troubled , and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id hat@@ h obe@@ yed TH@@ Y voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y words which th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est un@@ to me .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , he@@ arken th@@ ou also un@@ to the voice of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before the@@ e ; and eat , that th@@ ou may@@ est have strength , when th@@ ou go@@ est on TH@@ Y way .
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , comp@@ elled him ; and he hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to their voice . so he ar@@ ose from the ear@@ th , and sat upon the bed .
and the woman had a f@@ at cal@@ f in the house ; and she has@@ ted , and killed it , and took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and did bak@@ e un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread there@@ of :
and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands : but David and his men passed on in the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward with A@@ ch@@ ish .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , Sa@@ ul sle@@ w his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now rise up early in the morning with TH@@ Y master 's servants that are come with the@@ e : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part .
so David and his men rose up early to de@@ part in the morning , to return into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had inv@@ aded the south , and Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and s@@ mit@@ ten Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ;
so David and his men came to the city , and , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
and David was greatly dist@@ ressed ; for the people sp@@ ake of st@@ oning him , because the sou@@ l of all the people was gri@@ ev@@ ed , every man for his sons and for his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
and they gave him a piece of a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and two clu@@ sters of ra@@ is@@ ins : and when he had e@@ aten , his spirit came again to him : for he had e@@ aten no bread , nor dr@@ un@@ k any water , three days and three n@@ ights .
we made an inv@@ asion upon the south of the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and upon the coast which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and upon the south of Cal@@ e@@ b ; and we burned Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g with fire .
and David smo@@ te them from the tw@@ il@@ ight even un@@ to the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which ro@@ de upon ca@@ me@@ ls , and fled .
and there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , neither sp@@ oil , nor any thing that they had taken to them : David recovered all .
for who will he@@ arken un@@ to you in this matter ? but as his part is that go@@ eth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tar@@ ri@@ eth by the stu@@ ff : they shall part alike .
and when David came to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , he sent of the sp@@ oil un@@ to the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to his friends , saying , be@@ hold a present for you of the sp@@ oil of the enem@@ ies of the Lord ;
and to them which were in R@@ ach@@ al , and to them which were in the cities of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , and to them which were in the cities of the Ken@@ ites ,
and to them which were in Hor@@ ma@@ h , and to them which were in Ch@@ or @@@ -@@ @ ash@@ an , and to them which were in Ath@@ ach ,
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard upon Sa@@ ul and upon his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines sle@@ w Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , Sa@@ ul 's sons .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his three sons fallen in mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
and they cut off his head , and stri@@ pped off his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to publish it in the house of their id@@ ols , and among the people .
and they put his arm@@ our in the house of Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : and they fas@@ tened his body to the wall of Beth @@@ -@@ @ S@@ han .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and went all night , and took the body of Sa@@ ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @@@ -@@ @ S@@ han , and came to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and bur@@ n@@ t them there .
now it came to pass after the death of Sa@@ ul , when David was returned from the sla@@ ughter of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and David had abo@@ de two days in Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g ;
it came even to pass on the third day , that , be@@ hold , a man came out of the camp from Sa@@ ul with his clo@@ th@@ es rent , and ear@@ th upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the ear@@ th , and did obe@@ is@@ ance .
and David said un@@ to him , Ho@@ w went the matter ? I pra@@ y the@@ e , tell me . and he answ@@ ered , That the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son are dead also .
and the young man that told him said , As I happened by chance upon mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul le@@ an@@ ed upon his spe@@ ar ; and , lo , the char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men followed hard after him .
and he said un@@ to me again , St@@ and , I pra@@ y the@@ e , upon me , and s@@ lay me : for an@@ gu@@ ish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until even , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
( also he b@@ ade them te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the use of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ her . )
from the blood of the sla@@ in , from the f@@ at of the m@@ igh@@ ty , the bo@@ w of Jon@@ athan turned not back , and the s@@ word of Sa@@ ul returned not empty .
Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan were lov@@ ely and pleas@@ ant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les , they were stronger than li@@ ons .
I am dist@@ ressed for the@@ e , my brother Jon@@ athan : very pleas@@ ant h@@ ast th@@ ou been un@@ to me : TH@@ Y love to me was won@@ der@@ ful , passing the love of women .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of He@@ br@@ on .
and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . and they told David , saying , That the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad were they that buried Sa@@ ul .
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , and said un@@ to them , b@@ les@@ sed be ye of the Lord , that ye have she@@ wed this kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to your lor@@ d , even un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye val@@ i@@ ant : for your master Sa@@ ul is dead , and also the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have ano@@ in@@ ted me king over them .
but Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , captain of Sa@@ ul 's host , took Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul , and brought him over to Mah@@ an@@ aim ;
and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and the servants of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul , went out from Mah@@ an@@ aim to Gi@@ be@@ on .
and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gi@@ be@@ on : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and th@@ rust his s@@ word in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : where@@ fore that place was called Hel@@ kat@@ h @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and there was a very sor@@ e battle that day ; and Ab@@ ner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
and there were three sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah there , Jo@@ a@@ b , and Ab@@ is@@ hai , and A@@ sah@@ el : and A@@ sah@@ el was as light of fo@@ ot as a wild ro@@ e .
and A@@ sah@@ el pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Ab@@ ner .
and Ab@@ ner said to him , Tur@@ n the@@ e aside to TH@@ Y right hand or to TH@@ Y left , and lay the@@ e hold on one of the young men , and take the@@ e his arm@@ our . but A@@ sah@@ el would not turn aside from following of him .
Jo@@ a@@ b also and Ab@@ is@@ hai pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Am@@ ma@@ h , that li@@ eth before Gi@@ ah by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Gi@@ be@@ on .
and the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Ab@@ ner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
and Ab@@ ner and his men walked all that night through the pla@@ in , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bi@@ th@@ ron , and they came to Mah@@ an@@ aim .
but the servants of David had s@@ mit@@ ten of Benjamin , and of Ab@@ ner 's men , so that three hundred and thre@@ es@@ core men died .
and they took up A@@ sah@@ el , and buried him in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father , which was in B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . and Jo@@ a@@ b and his men went all night , and they came to He@@ br@@ on at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David : but David wa@@ xed stronger and stronger , and the house of Sa@@ ul wa@@ xed we@@ aker and we@@ aker .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
and the fourth , Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ; and the fifth , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of A@@ bi@@ tal ;
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David , that Ab@@ ner made himself strong for the house of Sa@@ ul .
now then do it : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken of David , saying , By the hand of my ser@@ vant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies .
and Ab@@ ner also sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
so Ab@@ ner came to David to He@@ br@@ on , and twenty men with him . and David made Ab@@ ner and the men that were with him a feast .
when Jo@@ a@@ b and all the host that was with him were come , they told Jo@@ a@@ b , saying , Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er came to the king , and he hat@@ h sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
T@@ ho@@ u know@@ est Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , that he came to dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , and to know TH@@ Y going out and TH@@ Y coming in , and to know all that th@@ ou do@@ est .
and they buried Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on : and the king lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt at the grave of Ab@@ ner ; and all the people we@@ pt .
TH@@ Y hands were not bound , nor TH@@ Y feet put into f@@ et@@ ters : as a man fal@@ le@@ th before w@@ ic@@ ked men , so fel@@ lest th@@ ou . and all the people we@@ pt again over him .
for all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to s@@ lay Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er .
and the sons of R@@ im@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , Rec@@ ha@@ b and Ba@@ an@@ ah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h , who lay on a bed at noon .
how much more , when w@@ ic@@ ked men have sla@@ in a righ@@ te@@ ous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the ear@@ th ?
also in time past , when Sa@@ ul was king over us , th@@ ou w@@ ast he that led@@ dest out and b@@ rough@@ test in Israel : and the Lord said to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fe@@ ed my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be a captain over Israel .
and David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel , and that he had ex@@ al@@ ted his k@@ ing@@ dom for his people Israel 's sake .
and these be the names of those that were born un@@ to him in Jer@@ usalem ; Sh@@ am@@ mu@@ a , and Sho@@ ba@@ b , and Na@@ than , and Solomon ,
but when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted David king over Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
and when David inqu@@ ired of the Lord , he said , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not go up ; but f@@ et@@ ch a comp@@ ass behind them , and come upon them over against the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees .
and let it be , when th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound of a going in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ esti@@ r th@@ y@@ self : for then shall the Lord go out before the@@ e , to sm@@ ite the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and they set the Ar@@ k of God upon a new c@@ art , and brought it out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b that was in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hi@@ o , the sons of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , dra@@ ve the new c@@ art .
and when they came to N@@ ach@@ on 's th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , Uz@@ z@@ ah put forth his hand to the Ar@@ k of God , and took hold of it ; for the ox@@ en sho@@ ok it .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ z@@ ah ; and God smo@@ te him there for his er@@ ror ; and there he died by the Ar@@ k of God .
and David was disp@@ le@@ ased , because the Lord had made a breach upon Uz@@ z@@ ah : and he called the name of the place Per@@ ez @@@ -@@ @ uz@@ z@@ ah to this day .
so David would not remove the Ar@@ k of the Lord un@@ to him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and the Ar@@ k of the Lord continued in the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te three months : and the Lord b@@ les@@ sed Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom , and all his household .
so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et .
and as the Ar@@ k of the Lord came into the city of David , Mic@@ hal Sa@@ ul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before the Lord ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
and they brought in the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and set it in his place , in the mid@@ st of the tab@@ ern@@ acle that David had pit@@ ched for it : and David offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before the Lord .
and as soon as David had made an end of offering bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multi@@ tude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a c@@ ake of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine . so all the people depar@@ ted every one to his house .
and I will yet be more v@@ ile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the ma@@ id@@ servants which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
and it came to pass , when the king sat in his house , and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enem@@ ies ;
and it came to pass that night , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Na@@ than , saying ,
whereas I have not d@@ wel@@ t in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
now therefore so s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to my ser@@ vant David , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , I took the@@ e from the she@@ ep@@ co@@ te , from following the she@@ ep , to be ru@@ ler over my people , over Israel :
and I was with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies out of TH@@ Y sight , and have made the@@ e a great name , like un@@ to the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and when TH@@ Y days be fulfilled , and th@@ ou s@@ halt sle@@ ep with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , I will set up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall proceed out of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , I will ch@@ as@@ ten him with the ro@@ d of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men :
and this was yet a small thing in TH@@ Y sight , O Lord God ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken also of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , O Lord God ?
for TH@@ Y word 's sake , and according to th@@ ine own heart , h@@ ast th@@ ou done all these great things , to make TH@@ Y ser@@ vant know them .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore th@@ ou art great , O Lord God : for there is none like the@@ e , neither is there any God bes@@ ide the@@ e , according to all that we have heard with our e@@ ars .
and now , O Lord God , the word that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken concerning TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
and after this it came to pass , that David smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sub@@ du@@ ed them : and David took Me@@ the@@ g @@@ -@@ @ am@@ ma@@ h out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and he smo@@ te Mo@@ a@@ b , and meas@@ ured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines meas@@ ured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Mo@@ abi@@ tes became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
David smo@@ te also Had@@ ade@@ zer , the son of Re@@ ho@@ b , king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , as he went to rec@@ over his border at the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
and David took from him a thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and seven hundred hor@@ se@@ men , and twenty thousand foot@@ men : and David h@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed all the char@@ i@@ ot hor@@ ses , but reserved of them for an hundred char@@ i@@ ots .
and when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to succ@@ our Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans two and twenty thousand men .
and David took the shi@@ elds of gold that were on the servants of Had@@ ade@@ zer , and brought them to Jer@@ usalem .
and David g@@ at him a name when he returned from s@@ mit@@ ing of the Syri@@ ans in the val@@ ley of salt , being E@@ igh@@ teen thousand men .
and he put gar@@ ris@@ ons in E@@ dom ; throughout all E@@ dom put he gar@@ ris@@ ons , and all they of E@@ dom became David 's servants . and the Lord preserved David w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he went .
and Zad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the pri@@ ests ; and Ser@@ ai@@ ah was the s@@ cri@@ be ;
then said Z@@ ib@@ a un@@ to the king , Accor@@ ding to all that my lor@@ d the king hat@@ h comman@@ ded his ser@@ vant , so shall TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do . as for M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h had a young son , whose name was Mic@@ ha . and all that d@@ wel@@ t in the house of Z@@ ib@@ a were servants un@@ to M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h .
so M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem : for he did eat continu@@ ally at the king 's table ; and was la@@ me on both his feet .
and it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of Am@@ mon died , and Han@@ un his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore Han@@ un took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved off the one half of their be@@ ards , and cut off their gar@@ ments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ a , and of Re@@ ho@@ b , and Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ to@@ b , and Ma@@ ac@@ ah , were by themselves in the field .
when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
and he said , If the Syri@@ ans be too strong for me , then th@@ ou s@@ halt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for the@@ e , then I will come and help the@@ e .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the Lord do that which se@@ eme@@ th him good .
and Jo@@ a@@ b drew n@@ igh , and the people that were with him , un@@ to the battle against the Syri@@ ans : and they fled before him .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , then fled they also before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . so Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
and Had@@ are@@ zer sent , and brought out the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and they came to He@@ lam ; and Sho@@ b@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to He@@ lam . and the Syri@@ ans set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and it came to pass in an even@@ ing@@ ti@@ de , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked upon the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman w@@ ashing her@@ self ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and took her ; and she came in un@@ to him , and he lay with her ; for she was pur@@ ified from her un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess : and she returned un@@ to her house .
and when U@@ ri@@ ah was come un@@ to him , David demanded of him how Jo@@ a@@ b did , and how the people did , and how the war prosp@@ ered .
and David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , G@@ o down to TH@@ Y house , and was@@ h TH@@ Y feet . and U@@ ri@@ ah depar@@ ted out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mes@@ s of meat from the king .
but U@@ ri@@ ah sle@@ pt at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lor@@ d , and went not down to his house .
and when they had told David , saying , U@@ ri@@ ah went not down un@@ to his house , David said un@@ to U@@ ri@@ ah , C@@ ame@@ st th@@ ou not from TH@@ Y journey ? why then di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou not go down un@@ to th@@ ine house ?
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him dr@@ un@@ k : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lor@@ d , but went not down to his house .
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Jo@@ a@@ b , and sent it by the hand of U@@ ri@@ ah .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , S@@ et ye U@@ ri@@ ah in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the hot@@ test battle , and re@@ tire ye from him , that he may be s@@ mit@@ ten , and die .
and it came to pass , when Jo@@ a@@ b observed the city , that he assigned U@@ ri@@ ah un@@ to a place where he knew that val@@ i@@ ant men were .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Jo@@ a@@ b : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te died also .
and if so be that the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore appro@@ ached ye so n@@ igh un@@ to the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
and the sho@@ o@@ ters shot from off the wall upon TH@@ Y servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and TH@@ Y ser@@ vant U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te is dead also .
and I gave the@@ e TH@@ Y master 's house , and TH@@ Y master 's wi@@ ves into TH@@ Y bos@@ om , and gave the@@ e the house of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given un@@ to the@@ e such and such things .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou desp@@ ised the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , to do ev@@ il in his sight ? th@@ ou h@@ ast killed U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te with the s@@ word , and h@@ ast taken his wife to be TH@@ Y wife , and h@@ ast sla@@ in him with the s@@ word of the children of Am@@ mon .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will raise up ev@@ il against the@@ e out of th@@ ine own house , and I will take TH@@ Y wi@@ ves before th@@ ine eyes , and give them un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour , and he shall lie with TH@@ Y wi@@ ves in the sight of this sun .
and Na@@ than depar@@ ted un@@ to his house . and the Lord struck the child that U@@ ri@@ ah 's wife b@@ are un@@ to David , and it was very si@@ ck .
and the el@@ ders of his house ar@@ ose , and went to him , to raise him up from the ear@@ th : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then said his servants un@@ to him , What thing is this that th@@ ou h@@ ast done ? th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st fast and we@@ ep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st rise and eat bread .
and he took their king 's cro@@ wn from off his head , the weight where@@ of was a tal@@ ent of gold with the pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : and it was set on David 's head . and he brought forth the sp@@ oil of the city in great ab@@ und@@ ance .
and it came to pass after this , that Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tam@@ ar ; and Am@@ non the son of David lov@@ ed her .
but Am@@ non had a friend , whose name was Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b , the son of Shi@@ me@@ ah David 's brother : and Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b was a very sub@@ til man .
so Am@@ non lay down , and made himself si@@ ck : and when the king was come to see him , Am@@ non said un@@ to the king , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let Tam@@ ar my sister come , and make me a couple of cak@@ es in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
so Tam@@ ar went to her brother Am@@ non 's house ; and he was laid down . and she took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and made cak@@ es in his sight , and did bak@@ e the cak@@ es .
and she took a pan , and p@@ oured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Am@@ non said , H@@ ave out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and Am@@ non said un@@ to Tam@@ ar , Br@@ ing the meat into the chamber , that I may eat of th@@ ine hand . and Tam@@ ar took the cak@@ es which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Am@@ non her brother .
and I , w@@ hi@@ ther shall I cause my sh@@ ame to go ? and as for the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak un@@ to the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from the@@ e .
and she had a gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs upon her : for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that were vir@@ g@@ ins appar@@ elled . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and rent her gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on cr@@ ying .
and it came to pass after two full years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om had she@@ ep@@ s@@ hear@@ ers in Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ or , which is bes@@ ide E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and Ab@@ sal@@ om invited all the king 's sons .
and the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did un@@ to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had comman@@ ded . then all the king 's sons ar@@ ose , and every man g@@ at him up upon his mul@@ e , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hat@@ h sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
now therefore let not my lor@@ d the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Am@@ non only is dead .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and we@@ pt : and the king also and all his servants we@@ pt very sor@@ e .
and TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id had two sons , and they two stro@@ ve together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smo@@ te the other , and sle@@ w him .
now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing un@@ to my lor@@ d the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id said , I will now speak un@@ to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his hand@@ ma@@ id .
for the king will hear , to deliver his hand@@ ma@@ id out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inher@@ it@@ ance of God .
then th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id said , The word of my lor@@ d the king shall now be comfortable : for as an an@@ gel of God , so is my lor@@ d the king to dis@@ cer@@ n good and bad : therefore the Lord TH@@ Y God will be with the@@ e .
to f@@ et@@ ch about this form of speech hat@@ h TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Jo@@ a@@ b done this thing : and my lor@@ d is wise , according to the wis@@ dom of an an@@ gel of God , to know all things that are in the ear@@ th .
and Jo@@ a@@ b fell to the ground on his face , and bo@@ wed himself , and thanked the king : and Jo@@ a@@ b said , To day TH@@ Y ser@@ vant know@@ eth that I have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , my lor@@ d , O king , in that the king hat@@ h fulfilled the request of his ser@@ vant .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year 's end that he polled it : because the ha@@ ir was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the ha@@ ir of his head at two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els after the king 's weight .
and un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tam@@ ar : she was a woman of a fair coun@@ tenance .
therefore Ab@@ sal@@ om sent for Jo@@ a@@ b , to have sent him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
so Jo@@ a@@ b came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bo@@ wed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king k@@ is@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and it was so , that when any man came n@@ igh to him to do him obe@@ is@@ ance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and on this manner did Ab@@ sal@@ om to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Ab@@ sal@@ om st@@ ole the hear@@ ts of the men of Israel .
and it came to pass after for@@ ty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said un@@ to the king , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed un@@ to the Lord , in He@@ br@@ on .
and with Ab@@ sal@@ om went two hundred men out of Jer@@ usalem , that were called ; and they went in their simp@@ lic@@ ity , and they knew not any thing .
and the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tar@@ ried in a place that was far off .
and all his servants passed on bes@@ ide him ; and all the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and all the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the G@@ itti@@ tes , six hundred men which came after him from G@@ ath , passed on before the king .
and all the country we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and lo Zad@@ ok also , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes were with him , bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God : and they set down the Ar@@ k of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and the king said un@@ to Zad@@ ok , Car@@ ry back the Ar@@ k of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord , he will bring me again , and she@@ w me both it , and his habi@@ tation :
but if he thus say , I have no de@@ light in the@@ e ; be@@ hold , here am I , let him do to me as se@@ eme@@ th good un@@ to him .
and David went up by the as@@ cent of mount Oli@@ vet , and we@@ pt as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he wor@@ shi@@ pped God , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at rent , and ear@@ th upon his head :
and h@@ ast th@@ ou not there with the@@ e Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt hear out of the king 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them ye shall send un@@ to me every thing that ye can hear .
and when king David came to Ba@@ hur@@ im , be@@ hold , th@@ ence came out a man of the family of the house of Sa@@ ul , whose name was Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of Ger@@ a : he came forth , and Cur@@ sed still as he came .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that the Lord will look on mine aff@@ li@@ ction , and that the Lord will requ@@ ite me good for his cur@@ sing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shi@@ me@@ i went along on the hill 's side over against him , and Cur@@ sed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast d@@ ust .
and it came to pass , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , was come un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said un@@ to Ab@@ sal@@ om , God save the king , God save the king .
and again , whom should I serve ? should I not serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in TH@@ Y father 's presence , so will I be in TH@@ Y presence .
so they spread Ab@@ sal@@ om a tent upon the top of the house ; and Ab@@ sal@@ om went in un@@ to his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines in the sight of all Israel .
and the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el , which he coun@@ sel@@ led in those days , was as if a man had inqu@@ ired at the or@@ acle of God : so was all the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el both with David and with Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and I will come upon him while he is we@@ ary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will sm@@ ite the king only :
for , said Hus@@ hai , th@@ ou know@@ est TH@@ Y father and his men , that they be m@@ igh@@ ty men , and they be c@@ haf@@ ed in their min@@ ds , as a bear ro@@ bbed of her whel@@ ps in the field : and TH@@ Y father is a man of war , and will not lo@@ dge with the people .
and he also that is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t : for all Israel know@@ eth that TH@@ Y father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and they which be with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
therefore I coun@@ sel that all Israel be generally gathered un@@ to the@@ e , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , as the s@@ and that is by the sea for multi@@ tude ; and that th@@ ou go to battle in th@@ ine own person .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew fal@@ le@@ th on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
moreover , if he be gotten into a city , then shall all Israel bring ro@@ pes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone found there .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om and all the men of Israel said , The coun@@ sel of Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite is better than the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el . for the Lord had appointed to defeat the good coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el , to the intent that the Lord might bring ev@@ il upon Ab@@ sal@@ om .
then David ar@@ ose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over Jordan : by the morning light there la@@ cked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan .
and when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his coun@@ sel was not followed , he s@@ add@@ led his ass , and ar@@ ose , and g@@ at him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and han@@ ged himself , and died , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om made A@@ masa captain of the host instead of Jo@@ a@@ b : which A@@ masa was a man 's son , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra an Isra@@ elite , that went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
and Jo@@ a@@ b said un@@ to the man that told him , An@@ d , be@@ hold , th@@ ou sa@@ west him , and why di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou not sm@@ ite him there to the ground ? and I would have given the@@ e ten sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and a gir@@ dle .
otherwise I should have w@@ rought fal@@ se@@ hood against mine own life : for there is no matter hi@@ d from the king , and th@@ ou th@@ y@@ self wo@@ ul@@ dest have set th@@ y@@ self against me .
and they took Ab@@ sal@@ om , and cast him into a great p@@ it in the wood , and laid a very great he@@ ap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the ro@@ of over the gate un@@ to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold a man running alone .
and the watch@@ man cri@@ ed , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is ti@@ dings in his m@@ outh . and he came Ap@@ ace , and drew near .
and the victory that day was turned into mourning un@@ to all the people : for the people heard say that day how the king was gri@@ ev@@ ed for his son .
and the people g@@ at them by ste@@ alth that day into the city , as people being as@@ ha@@ med ste@@ al away when they flee in battle .
and Jo@@ a@@ b came into the house to the king , and said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast sha@@ med this day the faces of all TH@@ Y servants , which this day have sav@@ ed TH@@ Y life , and the lives of TH@@ Y sons and of TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the lives of TH@@ Y wi@@ ves , and the lives of TH@@ Y conc@@ ub@@ ines ;
and he bo@@ wed the heart of all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h , even as the heart of one man ; so that they sent this word un@@ to the king , Ret@@ ur@@ n th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y servants .
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Ju@@ da@@ h came to G@@ ilg@@ al , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
and Shi@@ me@@ i the son of Ger@@ a , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , which was of Ba@@ hur@@ im , has@@ ted and came down with the men of Ju@@ da@@ h to meet king David .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Z@@ ib@@ a the ser@@ vant of the house of Sa@@ ul , and his fif@@ teen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , be@@ hold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king .
and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul came down to meet the king , and had neither d@@ ressed his feet , nor tri@@ m@@ med his be@@ ard , nor was@@ hed his clo@@ th@@ es , from the day the king depar@@ ted until the day he came again in peace .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jer@@ usalem to meet the king , that the king said un@@ to him , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore w@@ en@@ test not th@@ ou with me , M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ?
now Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i was a very aged man , even fo@@ ur@@ score years old : and he had provided the king of sust@@ en@@ ance while he lay at Mah@@ an@@ aim ; for he was a very great man .
and the king answ@@ ered , Ch@@ im@@ ham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good un@@ to the@@ e : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt require of me , that will I do for the@@ e .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king k@@ is@@ sed Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , and b@@ les@@ sed him ; and he returned un@@ to his own place .
then the king went on to G@@ ilg@@ al , and Ch@@ im@@ ham went on with him : and all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
so A@@ masa went to assem@@ ble the men of Ju@@ da@@ h : but he tar@@ ried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
and there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men : and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Jo@@ a@@ b , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
and he went through all the tri@@ bes of Israel un@@ to A@@ bel , and to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and all the Ber@@ ites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then she sp@@ ake , saying , They were won@@ t to speak in old time , saying , They shall su@@ rely ask coun@@ sel at A@@ bel : and so they ended the matter .
now Jo@@ a@@ b was over all the host of Israel : and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and over the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites :
but the king spar@@ ed M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , the son of Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul , because of the Lord 's oath that was between them , between David and Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , whom she b@@ are un@@ to Sa@@ ul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ; and the five sons of Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul , whom she brought up for Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the Me@@ ho@@ la@@ th@@ ite :
and it was told David what R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , the conc@@ ub@@ ine of Sa@@ ul , had done .
and he brought up from th@@ ence the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and the b@@ ones of Jon@@ athan his son ; and they gathered the b@@ ones of them that were han@@ ged .
and the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Ze@@ lah , in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king comman@@ ded . and after that God was in@@ treated for the land .
moreover the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and David wa@@ xed fa@@ int .
and it came to pass after this , that there was again a battle with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at Go@@ b : then Si@@ b@@ bec@@ hai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite sle@@ w Sap@@ h , which was of the sons of the giant .
and there was again a battle in Go@@ b with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , where El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are @@@ -@@ @ o@@ regi@@ m , a B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite , sle@@ w the brother of Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
and there was yet a battle in G@@ ath , where was a man of great stat@@ ure , that had on every hand six fin@@ gers , and on every fo@@ ot six to@@ es , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
and David sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
the God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , my high to@@ wer , and my ref@@ uge , my sa@@ vi@@ our ; th@@ ou sav@@ est me from violence .
I will call on the Lord , who is wor@@ thy to be praised : so shall I be sav@@ ed from mine enem@@ ies .
in my dist@@ ress I called upon the Lord , and cri@@ ed to my God : and he did hear my voice out of his temp@@ le , and my cry did enter into his e@@ ars .
there went up a smoke out of his nos@@ tr@@ ils , and fire out of his m@@ outh dev@@ oured : co@@ als were kin@@ d@@ led by it .
and he ro@@ de upon a ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and did fly : and he was seen upon the w@@ ings of the wind .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the re@@ bu@@ king of the Lord , at the blast of the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils .
for all his judg@@ ments were before me : and as for his stat@@ utes , I did not de@@ part from them .
and the aff@@ lic@@ ted people th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t save : but th@@ ine eyes are upon the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring them down .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the Lord is tried : he is a bu@@ ck@@ ler to all them that trust in him .
and I have consu@@ med them , and wounded them , that they could not arise : ye@@ a , they are fallen under my feet .
then did I beat them as small as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , I did stamp them as the m@@ ire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
T@@ ho@@ u also h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people , th@@ ou h@@ ast kept me to be head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
and that br@@ ing@@ eth me forth from mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou also h@@ ast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of J@@ es@@ se said , and the man who was raised up on high , the ano@@ in@@ ted of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , and the swe@@ et p@@ sal@@ mist of Israel , said ,
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel sp@@ ake to me , He that ru@@ le@@ th over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun ris@@ eth , even a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds ; as the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ inging out of the ear@@ th by clear sh@@ ining after rain .
but the sons of Bel@@ ial shall be all of them as thor@@ ns th@@ rust away , because they can@@ not be taken with hands :
but the man that shall touch them must be f@@ enced with iron and the staff of a spe@@ ar ; and they shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly burned with fire in the same place .
these be the names of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had : the T@@ ach@@ mon@@ ite that sat in the seat , chief among the cap@@ tains ; the same was Ad@@ ino the E@@ z@@ n@@ ite : he lift up his spe@@ ar against eight hundred , whom he sle@@ w at one time .
and after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of len@@ ti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time un@@ to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines pit@@ ched in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and the three m@@ igh@@ ty men br@@ ake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink there@@ of , but p@@ oured it out un@@ to the Lord .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man , of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done many acts , he sle@@ w two li@@ on@@ like men of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and sle@@ w a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow :
and he sle@@ w an Egyptian , a good@@ ly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and p@@ lu@@ cked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and sle@@ w him with his own spe@@ ar .
H@@ ele@@ b the son of Ba@@ an@@ ah , a Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , I@@ t@@ ta@@ i the son of Ri@@ ba@@ i out of Gi@@ be@@ ah of the children of Benjamin ,
for the king said to Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host , which was with him , G@@ o now through all the tri@@ bes of Israel , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , and number ye the people , that I may know the number of the people .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the king 's word prev@@ ailed against Jo@@ a@@ b , and against the cap@@ tains of the host . and Jo@@ a@@ b and the cap@@ tains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the strong hold of T@@ y@@ re , and to all the cities of the H@@ ibi@@ tes , and of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites : and they went out to the south of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
so when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jer@@ usalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
and Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the number of the people un@@ to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men that drew the s@@ word ; and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h were five hundred thousand men .
and David said un@@ to G@@ ad , I am in a great stra@@ it : let us fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for his mer@@ cies are great : and let me not fall into the hand of man .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah said un@@ to David , Let my lor@@ d the king take and offer up what se@@ eme@@ th good un@@ to him : be@@ hold , here be ox@@ en for bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and th@@ res@@ hing instruments and other instruments of the ox@@ en for wood .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore his servants said un@@ to him , Let there be sought for my lor@@ d the king a young vir@@ gin : and let her stand before the king , and let her ch@@ er@@ ish him , and let her lie in TH@@ Y bos@@ om , that my lor@@ d the king may get heat .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men which belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
now therefore come , let me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give the@@ e coun@@ sel , that th@@ ou may@@ est save th@@ ine own life , and the life of TH@@ Y son Solomon .
be@@ hold , while th@@ ou yet talk@@ est there with the king , I also will come in after the@@ e , and confirm TH@@ Y words .
and B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba went in un@@ to the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g the Sh@@ un@@ am@@ m@@ ite minist@@ ered un@@ to the king .
and he hat@@ h sla@@ in ox@@ en and f@@ at c@@ attle and she@@ ep in ab@@ und@@ ance , and hat@@ h called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host : but Solomon TH@@ Y ser@@ vant hat@@ h he not called .
and th@@ ou , my lor@@ d , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon the@@ e , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest tell them who shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of my lor@@ d the king after him .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lor@@ d the king shall sle@@ ep with his fa@@ thers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offen@@ ders .
and they told the king , saying , be@@ hold Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t . and when he was come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but me , even me TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Solomon , hat@@ h he not called .
even as I sw@@ are un@@ to the@@ e by the Lord God of Israel , saying , As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon TH@@ Y son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my th@@ r@@ one in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
the king also said un@@ to them , T@@ ake with you the servants of your lor@@ d , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mul@@ e , and bring him down to G@@ ih@@ on :
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my th@@ r@@ one ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ru@@ ler over Israel and over Ju@@ da@@ h .
so Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mul@@ e , and brought him to G@@ ih@@ on .
and all the people came up after him , and the people pip@@ ed with pip@@ es , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy , so that the ear@@ th rent with the sound of them .
and the king hat@@ h sent with him Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mul@@ e :
and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t have ano@@ in@@ ted him king in G@@ ih@@ on : and they are come up from th@@ ence re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , so that the city ran@@ g again . this is the no@@ ise that ye have heard .
and moreover the king 's servants came to b@@ less our lor@@ d king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than TH@@ Y name , and make his th@@ r@@ one greater than TH@@ Y th@@ r@@ one . and the king bo@@ wed himself upon the bed .
and also thus said the king , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of Israel , which hat@@ h given one to sit on my th@@ r@@ one this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah fear@@ ed because of Solomon , and ar@@ ose , and went , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
now the days of David drew n@@ igh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
now therefore hold him not guil@@ t@@ less : for th@@ ou art a wise man , and know@@ est what th@@ ou ou@@ gh@@ test to do un@@ to him ; but his ho@@ ar head bring th@@ ou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel were for@@ ty years : seven years re@@ ig@@ ned he in He@@ br@@ on , and thirty and three years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem .
so Solomon th@@ rust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being pri@@ est un@@ to the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake concerning the house of E@@ li in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
then ti@@ dings came to Jo@@ a@@ b : for Jo@@ a@@ b had turned after Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , though he turned not after Ab@@ sal@@ om . and Jo@@ a@@ b fled un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
and it was told king Solomon that Jo@@ a@@ b was fled un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; and , be@@ hold , he is by the alt@@ ar . then Solomon sent Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , G@@ o , fall upon him .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Jo@@ a@@ b , and upon the head of his se@@ ed for ever : but upon David , and upon his se@@ ed , and upon his house , and upon his th@@ r@@ one , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
so Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada went up , and fell upon him , and sle@@ w him : and he was buried in his own house in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and the king put Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada in his room over the host : and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est did the king put in the room of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar .
for it shall be , that on the day th@@ ou go@@ est out , and pass@@ est over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , th@@ ou s@@ halt know for certain that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die : TH@@ Y blood shall be upon th@@ ine own head .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shi@@ me@@ i ran away un@@ to A@@ ch@@ ish son of Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h king of G@@ ath . and they told Shi@@ me@@ i , saying , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants be in G@@ ath .
the king said moreover to Shi@@ me@@ i , T@@ ho@@ u know@@ est all the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess which th@@ ine heart is priv@@ y to , that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st to David my father : therefore the Lord shall return TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess upon th@@ ine own head ;
so the king comman@@ ded Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; which went out , and fell upon him , that he died . and the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in the hand of Solomon .
and the king went to Gi@@ be@@ on to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings did Solomon offer upon that alt@@ ar .
and now , O Lord my God , th@@ ou h@@ ast made TH@@ Y ser@@ vant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
and TH@@ Y ser@@ vant is in the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y people which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , a great people , that can@@ not be num@@ ber@@ ed nor counted for multi@@ tude .
and I have also given the@@ e that which th@@ ou h@@ ast not asked , both ri@@ ches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like un@@ to the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
and Solomon aw@@ oke ; and , be@@ hold , it was a dream . and he came to Jer@@ usalem , and stood before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and offered up bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and offered peace offer@@ ings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no st@@ ran@@ ger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and she ar@@ ose at midnight , and took my son from bes@@ ide me , while th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id sle@@ pt , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and laid her dead child in my bos@@ om .
and when I rose in the morning to give my child su@@ ck , be@@ hold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , be@@ hold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
then said the king , The one sa@@ ith , This is my son that li@@ vet@@ h , and TH@@ Y son is the dead : and the other sa@@ ith , N@@ ay ; but TH@@ Y son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Na@@ than was over the officers : and Z@@ ab@@ ud the son of Na@@ than was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
Ba@@ ana the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud ; to him per@@ tained Ta@@ an@@ ach and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and all Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean , which is by Z@@ art@@ an@@ ah ben@@ e@@ ath J@@ ez@@ reel , from Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean to A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , even un@@ to the place that is beyond Jok@@ ne@@ am :
the son of Ge@@ ber , in Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad ; to him per@@ tained the towns of J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which are in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; to him also per@@ tained the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , which is in B@@ ash@@ an , thre@@ es@@ core great cities with walls and br@@ as@@ en bars :
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , in the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
and Solomon re@@ ig@@ ned over all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms from the river un@@ to the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and un@@ to the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
for he had domin@@ ion over all the region on this side the river , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Az@@ z@@ ah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and God gave Solomon wis@@ dom and understanding exceeding much , and lar@@ gen@@ ess of heart , even as the s@@ and that is on the sea shore .
and Solomon 's wis@@ dom exc@@ elled the wis@@ dom of all the children of the east country , and all the wis@@ dom of Egypt .
for he was wis@@ er than all men ; than E@@ than the E@@ z@@ rah@@ ite , and H@@ eman , and Chal@@ col , and Dar@@ da , the sons of Ma@@ hol : and his f@@ ame was in all nations round about .
and he sp@@ ake of trees , from the c@@ ed@@ ar tree that is in Lebanon even un@@ to the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p that spr@@ ing@@ eth out of the wall : he sp@@ ake also of be@@ asts , and of fo@@ w@@ l , and of cre@@ eping things , and of fis@@ hes .
and H@@ i@@ ram king of T@@ y@@ re sent his servants un@@ to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted him king in the room of his father : for H@@ i@@ ram was ever a l@@ over of David .
and H@@ i@@ ram sent to Solomon , saying , I have considered the things which th@@ ou sen@@ test to me for : and I will do all TH@@ Y desire concerning tim@@ ber of c@@ ed@@ ar , and concerning tim@@ ber of f@@ ir .
and Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of p@@ ure oil : thus gave Solomon to H@@ i@@ ram year by year .
bes@@ ide the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eigh@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Z@@ if , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length there@@ of was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the por@@ ch before the temp@@ le of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length there@@ of , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house ; and ten cu@@ bi@@ ts was the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built ch@@ ambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle : and he made ch@@ ambers round about :
the ne@@ ther@@ most chamber was five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the middle was six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the third was seven cu@@ bi@@ ts broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narro@@ wed rests round about , that the be@@ ams should not be fas@@ tened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought th@@ ither : so that there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
concerning this house which th@@ ou art in building , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk in my stat@@ utes , and exec@@ ute my judg@@ ments , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with the@@ e , which I sp@@ ake un@@ to David TH@@ Y father :
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the ci@@ el@@ ing : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with plan@@ ks of f@@ ir .
and the or@@ acle he prepared in the house within , to set there the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in length , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in b@@ read@@ th , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in the he@@ ight there@@ of : and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold ; and so covered the alt@@ ar which was of c@@ ed@@ ar .
so Solomon over@@ laid the house within with p@@ ure gold : and he made a partition by the cha@@ ins of gold before the or@@ acle ; and he over@@ laid it with gold .
and the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole alt@@ ar that was by the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
and five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the he@@ ight of the one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and so was it of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
and he set the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms within the in@@ ner house : and they stret@@ ched forth the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b touched the other wall ; and their w@@ ings touched one another in the mid@@ st of the house .
the two doors also were of olive tree ; and he car@@ ved upon them car@@ v@@ ings of ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms and pal@@ m trees and open flowers , and over@@ laid them with gold , and spread gold upon the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and upon the pal@@ m trees .
and the two doors were of f@@ ir tree : the two leaves of the one door were fol@@ ding , and the two leaves of the other door were fol@@ ding .
and in the ele@@ venth year , in the month B@@ ul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts there@@ of , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made a por@@ ch of pil@@ lars ; the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pil@@ lars and the th@@ ick be@@ am were before them .
then he made a por@@ ch for the th@@ r@@ one where he might judge , even the por@@ ch of judgment : and it was covered with c@@ ed@@ ar from one side of the floor to the other .
and his house where he d@@ wel@@ t had another court within the por@@ ch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like un@@ to this por@@ ch .
and the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and stones of eight cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the great court round about was with three ro@@ ws of he@@ wed stones , and a row of c@@ ed@@ ar be@@ ams , both for the in@@ ner court of the house of the Lord , and for the por@@ ch of the house .
and he made two chap@@ it@@ ers of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set upon the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts :
and n@@ ets of chec@@ ker work , and w@@ re@@ aths of chain work , for the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ; seven for the one chap@@ iter , and seven for the other chap@@ iter .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the top of the pil@@ lars were of L@@ ily work in the por@@ ch , four cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers upon the two pil@@ lars had po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates also above , over against the bel@@ ly which was by the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred in ro@@ ws round about upon the other chap@@ iter .
and he set up the pil@@ lars in the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called the name there@@ of J@@ ach@@ in : and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and he called the name there@@ of Bo@@ az .
and he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea , ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from the one bri@@ m to the other : it was round all about , and his he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and under the bri@@ m of it round about there were k@@ n@@ ops comp@@ ass@@ ing it , ten in a cu@@ bit , comp@@ ass@@ ing the sea round about : the k@@ n@@ ops were cast in two ro@@ ws , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
and it was an hand b@@ read@@ th th@@ ick , and the bri@@ m there@@ of was w@@ rought like the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , with flowers of l@@ ilies : it contained two thousand ba@@ ths .
and he made ten bases of br@@ ass ; four cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length of one base , and four cu@@ bi@@ ts the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and three cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight of it .
and the work of the bases was on this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the led@@ ges :
and on the borders that were between the led@@ ges were li@@ ons , ox@@ en , and ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms : and upon the led@@ ges there was a base above : and ben@@ e@@ ath the li@@ ons and ox@@ en were certain addi@@ tions made of th@@ in work .
and every base had four br@@ as@@ en whe@@ els , and plates of br@@ ass : and the four cor@@ ners there@@ of had under@@ set@@ ters : under the lav@@ er were under@@ set@@ ters m@@ ol@@ ten , at the side of every addition .
and under the borders were four whe@@ els ; and the ax@@ let@@ re@@ es of the whe@@ els were joined to the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and a half a cu@@ bit .
and the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ let@@ re@@ es , and their nav@@ es , and their fel@@ lo@@ es , and their spok@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
and there were four under@@ set@@ ters to the four cor@@ ners of one base : and the under@@ set@@ ters were of the very base itself .
and in the top of the base was there a round comp@@ ass of half a cu@@ bit high : and on the top of the base the led@@ ges there@@ of and the borders there@@ of were of the same .
for on the plates of the led@@ ges there@@ of , and on the borders there@@ of , he gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , li@@ ons , and pal@@ m trees , according to the pro@@ portion of every one , and addi@@ tions round about .
then made he ten la@@ vers of br@@ ass : one lav@@ er contained for@@ ty ba@@ ths : and every lav@@ er was four cu@@ bi@@ ts : and upon every one of the ten bases one lav@@ er .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard over against the south .
and H@@ i@@ ram made the la@@ vers , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . so H@@ i@@ ram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lord :
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers that were on the top of the two pil@@ lars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks , even two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for one network , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the pil@@ lars ;
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons : and all these vessels , which H@@ i@@ ram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright br@@ ass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that per@@ tained un@@ to the house of the Lord : the alt@@ ar of gold , and the table of gold , where@@ upon the she@@ w@@ bread was ,
and the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of p@@ ure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the or@@ acle , with the flowers , and the lam@@ ps , and the ton@@ gs of gold ,
and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ons , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the cen@@ s@@ ers of p@@ ure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the in@@ ner house , the most hol@@ y place , and for the doors of the house , to w@@ it , of the temp@@ le .
so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the chief of the fa@@ thers of the children of Israel , un@@ to king Solomon in Jer@@ usalem , that they might bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves un@@ to king Solomon at the feast in the month E@@ than@@ im , which is the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even those did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and ox@@ en , that could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord un@@ to his place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
for the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread forth their two w@@ ings over the place of the Ar@@ k , and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms covered the Ar@@ k and the st@@ aves there@@ of above .
and they drew out the st@@ aves , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen out in the hol@@ y place before the or@@ acle , and they were not seen without : and there they are un@@ to this day .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k save the two tables of stone , which Mos@@ es put there at Ho@@ re@@ b , when the Lord made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests were come out of the hol@@ y place , that the cl@@ oud filled the house of the Lord ,
so that the pri@@ ests could not stand to minister because of the cl@@ oud : for the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
and the king turned his face about , and b@@ les@@ sed all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel : ( and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of Israel , which sp@@ ake with his m@@ outh un@@ to David my father , and hat@@ h with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
and the Lord said un@@ to David my father , whereas it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house un@@ to my name , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st well that it was in th@@ ine heart .
nevertheless th@@ ou s@@ halt not build the house ; but TH@@ Y son that shall come forth out of TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , he shall build the house un@@ to my name .
and the Lord hat@@ h performed his word that he sp@@ ake , and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and I have set there a place for the Ar@@ k , where@@ in is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the alt@@ ar of the Lord in the presence of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heav@@ en :
who h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that th@@ ou promis@@ ed@@ st him : th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est also with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let TH@@ Y word , I pra@@ y the@@ e , be ver@@ ified , which th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father .
yet have th@@ ou respect un@@ to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and to the pray@@ er , which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e to day :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which th@@ ou h@@ ast said , My name shall be there : that th@@ ou may@@ est he@@ arken un@@ to the pray@@ er which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant shall make toward this place .
and he@@ arken th@@ ou to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place : and hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place : and when th@@ ou hear@@ est , for@@ give .
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and do , and judge TH@@ Y servants , condemning the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way upon his head ; and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
when TH@@ Y people Israel be s@@ mit@@ ten down before the enemy , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e , and shall turn again to the@@ e , and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and pra@@ y , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the@@ e in this house :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y people Israel , and bring them again un@@ to the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers .
when heav@@ en is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e ; if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and turn from their sin , when th@@ ou aff@@ lic@@ test them :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y servants , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , that th@@ ou te@@ ach them the good way where@@ in they should walk , and give rain upon TH@@ Y land , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given to TH@@ Y people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
if there be in the land fam@@ ine , if there be p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , b@@ lasting , mil@@ dew , loc@@ ust , or if there be cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler ; if their enemy bes@@ i@@ ege them in the land of their cities ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever pla@@ gue , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever si@@ ck@@ ness there be ;
what pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation so@@ ever be made by any man , or by all TH@@ Y people Israel , which shall know every man the pla@@ gue of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou , even th@@ ou only , know@@ est the hear@@ ts of all the children of men ; )
that they may fear the@@ e all the days that they live in the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers .
moreover concerning a st@@ ran@@ ger , that is not of TH@@ Y people Israel , but co@@ me@@ th out of a far country for TH@@ Y name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of TH@@ Y great name , and of TH@@ Y strong hand , and of TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
if TH@@ Y people go out to battle against their enemy , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and shall pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for TH@@ Y name :
if they sin against the@@ e , ( for there is no man that sin@@ net@@ h not , ) and th@@ ou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tives un@@ to the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall be@@ think themselves in the land w@@ hi@@ ther they were carried cap@@ tives , and rep@@ ent , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the@@ e in the land of them that carried them cap@@ tives , saying , We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ ver@@ sely , we have committed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ;
and so return un@@ to the@@ e with all their heart , and with all their sou@@ l , in the land of their enem@@ ies , which led them away cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward their land , which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers , the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name :
and for@@ give TH@@ Y people that have sin@@ ned against the@@ e and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions where@@ in they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against the@@ e , and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before them who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them :
for they be TH@@ Y people , and th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test forth out of Egypt , from the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace of iron :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y people Israel , to he@@ arken un@@ to them in all that they call for un@@ to the@@ e .
and it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the Lord , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of the Lord , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread up to heav@@ en .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , that hat@@ h given rest un@@ to his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hat@@ h not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
that he may inc@@ line our hear@@ ts un@@ to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , and his judg@@ ments , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers .
and let these my words , where@@ with I have made supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord , be n@@ igh un@@ to the Lord our God day and night , that he maintain the cause of his ser@@ vant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God , to walk in his stat@@ utes , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , as at this day .
and Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , which he offered un@@ to the Lord , two and twenty thousand ox@@ en , and an hundred and twenty thousand she@@ ep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk before me , as David TH@@ Y father walked , in integrity of heart , and in u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , to do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and w@@ il@@ t keep my stat@@ utes and my judg@@ ments :
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David TH@@ Y father , saying , There shall not fail the@@ e a man upon the th@@ r@@ one of Israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and my stat@@ utes which I have set before you , but go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them :
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hal@@ low@@ ed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a pro@@ ver@@ b and a by@@ word among all people :
and at this house , which is high , every one that pass@@ eth by it shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
and H@@ i@@ ram came out from T@@ y@@ re to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in the city , and given it for a present un@@ to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the cities of store that Solomon had , and cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and that which Solomon desi@@ red to build in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
and all the people that were left of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , H@@ itti@@ tes , Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and Je@@ bu@@ sites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able ut@@ ter@@ ly to destroy , upon those did Solomon lev@@ y a tri@@ bute of bon@@ d@@ service un@@ to this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bon@@ d@@ men : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots , and his hor@@ se@@ men .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fif@@ ty , which b@@ are rule over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and king Solomon made a nav@@ y of ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber , which is bes@@ ide E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
and H@@ i@@ ram sent in the nav@@ y his servants , ship@@ men that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and she came to Jer@@ usalem with a very great train , with ca@@ me@@ ls that b@@ are sp@@ ices , and very much gold , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she commun@@ ed with him of all that was in her heart .
and she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of TH@@ Y acts and of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I believed not the words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , be@@ hold , the half was not told me : TH@@ Y wis@@ dom and prosperity exce@@ ede@@ th the f@@ ame which I heard .
and the nav@@ y also of H@@ i@@ ram , that brought gold from Op@@ hir , brought in from Op@@ hir great plenty of al@@ mu@@ g trees , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred thre@@ es@@ core and six tal@@ ents of gold .
bes@@ ide that he had of the mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men , and of the traffic@@ k of the sp@@ ice mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
the th@@ r@@ one had six steps , and the top of the th@@ r@@ one was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two li@@ ons stood bes@@ ide the stays .
and twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and gar@@ ments , and arm@@ our , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
and the king made silver to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ars made he to be as the sy@@ com@@ ore trees that are in the val@@ e , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
and Solomon had hor@@ ses brought out of Egypt , and lin@@ en yar@@ n : the king 's mer@@ chan@@ ts received the lin@@ en yar@@ n at a price .
and a char@@ i@@ ot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and an hor@@ se for an hundred and fif@@ ty : and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wi@@ ves turned away his heart after other go@@ ds : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then did Solomon build an high place for Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of Mo@@ a@@ b , in the hill that is before Jer@@ usalem , and for Mo@@ le@@ ch , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the children of Am@@ mon .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord said un@@ to Solomon , For@@ as@@ much as this is done of the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my stat@@ utes , which I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , I will su@@ rely ren@@ d the k@@ ing@@ dom from the@@ e , and will give it to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I will not ren@@ d away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but will give one tri@@ be to TH@@ Y son for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up an ad@@ versary un@@ to Solomon , Had@@ ad the E@@ dom@@ ite : he was of the king 's se@@ ed in E@@ dom .
for it came to pass , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was gone up to bur@@ y the sla@@ in , after he had s@@ mit@@ ten every male in E@@ dom ;
that Had@@ ad fled , he and certain E@@ dom@@ ites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Had@@ ad being yet a little child .
and they ar@@ ose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an : and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him vic@@ tuals , and gave him land .
and Had@@ ad found great favour in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es the qu@@ een .
and the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es b@@ are him Gen@@ ub@@ ath his son , whom Tah@@ pen@@ es we@@ an@@ ed in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house : and Gen@@ ub@@ ath was in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's household among the sons of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and when Had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and that Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was dead , Had@@ ad said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Let me de@@ part , that I may go to mine own country .
and he gathered men un@@ to him , and became captain over a band , when David sle@@ w them of Z@@ ob@@ ah : and they went to Dam@@ as@@ cus , and d@@ wel@@ t there@@ in , and re@@ ig@@ ned in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of Zer@@ eda , Solomon 's ser@@ vant , whose mother 's name was Zer@@ u@@ ah , a wi@@ dow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Mil@@ lo , and rep@@ aired the breaches of the city of David his father .
and the man Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ our : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industri@@ ous , he made him ru@@ ler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
and it came to pass at that time when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; and he had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field :
( but he shall have one tri@@ be for my ser@@ vant David 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel : )
but I will take the k@@ ing@@ dom out of his son 's hand , and will give it un@@ to the@@ e , even ten tri@@ bes .
and un@@ to his son will I give one tri@@ be , that David my ser@@ vant may have a light al@@ way before me in Jer@@ usalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am . and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am ar@@ ose , and fled into Egypt , un@@ to S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt ; )
that they sent and called him . and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel came , and sp@@ ake un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , saying ,
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , If th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t be a ser@@ vant un@@ to this people this day , and w@@ il@@ t serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be TH@@ Y servants for ever .
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men , which they had given him , and consul@@ ted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said un@@ to them , What coun@@ sel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Mak@@ e the yok@@ e which TH@@ Y father did put upon us ligh@@ ter ?
and the young men that were grown up with him sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou speak un@@ to this people that sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Th@@ y father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make th@@ ou it ligh@@ ter un@@ to us ; thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , My little fin@@ ger shall be th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's lo@@ ins .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the king hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord sp@@ ake by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite un@@ to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the tri@@ bute ; and all Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was come again , that they sent and called him un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
speak un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , the son of Solomon , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and un@@ to all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , and to the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , saying ,
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again un@@ to their lor@@ d , even un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall kill me , and go again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and he made an house of high places , and made pri@@ ests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of L@@ evi .
and , be@@ hold , there came a man of God out of Ju@@ da@@ h by the word of the Lord un@@ to Be@@ the@@ l : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am stood by the alt@@ ar to bur@@ n incen@@ se .
the alt@@ ar also was rent , and the ashes p@@ oured out from the alt@@ ar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
and the man of God said un@@ to the king , If th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t give me half th@@ ine house , I will not go in with the@@ e , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place :
for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord , saying , eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
now there d@@ wel@@ t an old pro@@ phe@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l : the words which he had spoken un@@ to the king , them they told also to their father .
for it was said to me by the word of the Lord , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t that brought him back :
and he cri@@ ed un@@ to the man of God that came from Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , For@@ as@@ much as th@@ ou h@@ ast dis@@ obe@@ yed the m@@ outh of the Lord , and h@@ ast not kept the comman@@ d@@ ment which the Lord TH@@ Y God comman@@ ded the@@ e ,
but ca@@ me@@ st back , and h@@ ast e@@ aten bread and dr@@ un@@ k water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to the@@ e , eat no bread , and drink no water ; TH@@ Y car@@ case shall not come un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers .
and it came to pass , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led for him the ass , to w@@ it , for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and sle@@ w him : and his car@@ case was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the car@@ case .
and , be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the car@@ case cast in the way , and the lion standing by the car@@ case : and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t d@@ wel@@ t .
and the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the car@@ case of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old pro@@ phe@@ t came to the city , to mour@@ n and to bur@@ y him .
and it came to pass , after he had buried him , that he sp@@ ake to his sons , saying , When I am dead , then bur@@ y me in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re where@@ in the man of God is buried ; lay my b@@ ones bes@@ ide his b@@ ones :
for the saying which he cri@@ ed by the word of the Lord against the alt@@ ar in Be@@ the@@ l , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samar@@ ia , shall su@@ rely come to pass .
and this thing became sin un@@ to the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and ar@@ ose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . but A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and rent the k@@ ing@@ dom away from the house of David , and gave it the@@ e : and yet th@@ ou h@@ ast not been as my ser@@ vant David , who kept my comman@@ d@@ ments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but h@@ ast done ev@@ il above all that were before the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast gone and made the@@ e other go@@ ds , and m@@ ol@@ ten images , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger , and h@@ ast cast me behind TH@@ Y back :
him that di@@ eth of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth in the field shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife ar@@ ose , and depar@@ ted , and came to Tir@@ z@@ ah : and when she came to the threshold of the door , the child died ;
and they buried him ; and all Israel mour@@ ned for him , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by the hand of his ser@@ vant A@@ hij@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t .
and the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and the days which Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am re@@ ig@@ ned were two and twenty years : and he sle@@ pt with this fa@@ thers , and Nad@@ a@@ b his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and Ju@@ da@@ h did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they had committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , that S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem :
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their stead br@@ as@@ en shi@@ elds , and committed them un@@ to the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and it was so , when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard b@@ are them , and brought them back into the guard chamber .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? and there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ am sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him in the city of David : and A@@ SA his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and for@@ ty and one years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , the daughter of Ab@@ is@@ hal@@ om .
and also Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h his mother , even her he removed from being qu@@ een , because she had made an i@@ dol in a gro@@ ve ; and A@@ SA destroyed her i@@ dol , and bur@@ n@@ t it by the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and Ba@@ as@@ ha king of Israel went up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and built Ram@@ ah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
so Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and all Cin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
and it came to pass , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard there@@ of , that he left off building of Ram@@ ah , and d@@ wel@@ t in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
then king A@@ SA made a proc@@ lamation throughout all Ju@@ da@@ h ; none was exemp@@ ted : and they took away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , where@@ with Ba@@ as@@ ha had buil@@ ded ; and king A@@ SA built with them Ge@@ ba of Benjamin , and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin .
and Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , consp@@ ired against him ; and Ba@@ as@@ ha smo@@ te him at G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ a@@ b and all Israel laid siege to G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on .
because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provoc@@ ation where@@ with he provoked the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
For@@ as@@ much as I ex@@ al@@ ted the@@ e out of the d@@ ust , and made the@@ e pr@@ ince over my people Israel ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast walked in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and h@@ ast made my people Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with their sin@@ s ;
be@@ hold , I will take away the poster@@ ity of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and the poster@@ ity of his house ; and will make TH@@ Y house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
him that di@@ eth of Ba@@ as@@ ha in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth of his in the fields shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat .
now the rest of the acts of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and his ser@@ vant Z@@ im@@ ri , captain of half his char@@ i@@ ots , consp@@ ired against him , as he was in Tir@@ z@@ ah , drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the house of Ar@@ za ste@@ ward of his house in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and Z@@ im@@ ri went in and smo@@ te him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his th@@ r@@ one , that he sle@@ w all the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha : he left him not one that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against a wall , neither of his k@@ ins@@ fol@@ ks , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of E@@ lah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and the people that were en@@ camp@@ ed heard say , Z@@ im@@ ri hat@@ h consp@@ ired , and hat@@ h also sla@@ in the king : where@@ fore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and it came to pass , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sin@@ s which he sin@@ ned in doing ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , in walk@@ ing in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he w@@ rought , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath , to make him king ; and half followed Om@@ ri .
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he she@@ wed , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and in the thirty and eighth year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h began A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri to reign over Israel : and A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel in Samar@@ ia twenty and two years .
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , that he took to wife J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel the daughter of Eth@@ ba@@ al king of the Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and went and served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
and A@@ ha@@ b made a gro@@ ve ; and A@@ ha@@ b did more to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger than all the kings of Israel that were before him .
and it shall be , that th@@ ou s@@ halt drink of the Bro@@ ok ; and I have comman@@ ded the ra@@ ven@@ s to fe@@ ed the@@ e there .
so he went and did according un@@ to the word of the Lord : for he went and d@@ wel@@ t by the Bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before Jordan .
and the ra@@ ven@@ s brought him bread and f@@ les@@ h in the morning , and bread and f@@ les@@ h in the evening ; and he d@@ rank of the Bro@@ ok .
and it came to pass after a while , that the Bro@@ ok dri@@ ed up , because there had been no rain in the land .
and as she was going to f@@ et@@ ch it , he called to her , and said , Br@@ ing me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a mor@@ sel of bread in th@@ ine hand .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah said un@@ to her , Fe@@ ar not ; go and do as th@@ ou h@@ ast said : but make me there@@ of a little c@@ ake first , and bring it un@@ to me , and after make for the@@ e and for TH@@ Y son .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , The bar@@ rel of me@@ al shall not waste , neither shall the cr@@ use of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sen@@ de@@ th rain upon the ear@@ th .
and she went and did according to the saying of Eli@@ j@@ ah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
and the bar@@ rel of me@@ al was@@ ted not , neither did the cr@@ use of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by Eli@@ j@@ ah .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mist@@ ress of the house , fell si@@ ck ; and his si@@ ck@@ ness was so sor@@ e , that there was no bre@@ ath left in him .
and he said un@@ to her , Gi@@ ve me TH@@ Y son . and he took him out of her bos@@ om , and carried him up into a lo@@ ft , where he abo@@ de , and laid him upon his own bed .
and he stret@@ ched himself upon the child three times , and cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let this child 's sou@@ l come into him again .
and the Lord heard the voice of Eli@@ j@@ ah ; and the sou@@ l of the child came into him again , and he revi@@ ved .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him un@@ to his mother : and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , Se@@ e , TH@@ Y son li@@ vet@@ h .
and it came to pass after many days , that the word of the Lord came to Eli@@ j@@ ah in the third year , saying , G@@ o , she@@ w th@@ y@@ self un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b ; and I will send rain upon the ear@@ th .
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the Lord , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took an hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
and as Ob@@ adi@@ ah was in the way , be@@ hold , Eli@@ j@@ ah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art th@@ ou that my lor@@ d Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
was it not told my lor@@ d what I did when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel sle@@ w the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the Lord , how I hi@@ d an hundred men of the Lord 's pro@@ ph@@ ets by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water ?
and it came to pass , when mid@@ day was past , and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tri@@ bes of the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , un@@ to whom the word of the Lord came , saying , Israel shall be TH@@ Y name :
and with the stones he built an alt@@ ar in the name of the Lord : and he made a tren@@ ch about the alt@@ ar , as great as would contain two measures of se@@ ed .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bul@@ lock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and p@@ our it on the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and on the wood .
then the fire of the Lord fell , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the d@@ ust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the tren@@ ch .
and when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , The Lord , he is the God ; the Lord , he is the God .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah said un@@ to them , T@@ ake the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Ba@@ al ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Eli@@ j@@ ah brought them down to the Bro@@ ok K@@ ish@@ on , and sle@@ w them there .
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he cast himself down upon the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es ,
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heav@@ en was black with cl@@ ou@@ ds and wind , and there was a great rain . and A@@ ha@@ b ro@@ de , and went to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and when he saw that , he ar@@ ose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and left his ser@@ vant there .
and he looked , and , be@@ hold , there was a c@@ ake bak@@ en on the co@@ als , and a cr@@ use of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and he ar@@ ose , and did eat and drink , and went in the strength of that meat for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights un@@ to Ho@@ re@@ b the mount of God .
and he came th@@ ither un@@ to a cave , and lo@@ d@@ ged there ; and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came to him , and he said un@@ to him , What do@@ est th@@ ou here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
and it was so , when Eli@@ j@@ ah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his man@@ tle , and went out , and stood in the entering in of the cave . and , be@@ hold , there came a voice un@@ to him , and said , What do@@ est th@@ ou here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
and it shall come to pass , that him that escap@@ eth the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el shall J@@ eh@@ u s@@ lay : and him that escap@@ eth from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u shall E@@ lis@@ ha s@@ lay .
yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel , all the k@@ ne@@ es which have not bo@@ wed un@@ to Ba@@ al , and every m@@ outh which hat@@ h not k@@ is@@ sed him .
and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and hor@@ ses , and char@@ i@@ ots : and he went up and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Samar@@ ia , and war@@ red against it .
and the mes@@ sen@@ gers came again , and said , Th@@ us speak@@ eth Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad , saying , Al@@ though I have sent un@@ to the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt deliver me TH@@ Y silver , and TH@@ Y gold , and TH@@ Y wi@@ ves , and TH@@ Y children ;
yet I will send my servants un@@ to the@@ e to mor@@ row about this time , and they shall search th@@ ine house , and the houses of TH@@ Y servants ; and it shall be , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is pleas@@ ant in th@@ ine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
then he num@@ ber@@ ed the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two : and after them he num@@ ber@@ ed all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
and they went out at noon . but Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad was drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the pav@@ ili@@ ons , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him .
and the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces went out first ; and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad sent out , and they told him , saying , There are men come out of Samar@@ ia .
so these young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
and the servants of the king of Syria said un@@ to him , The@@ ir go@@ ds are go@@ ds of the hil@@ ls ; therefore they were stronger than we ; but let us fight against them in the pla@@ in , and su@@ rely we shall be stronger than they .
and do this thing , T@@ ake the kings away , every man out of his place , and put cap@@ tains in their rooms :
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad num@@ ber@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
and they pit@@ ched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans an hundred thousand foot@@ men in one day .
but the rest fled to A@@ ph@@ ek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left . and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad fled , and came into the city , into an in@@ ner chamber .
and a certain man of the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets said un@@ to his neighbour in the word of the Lord , Sm@@ ite me , I pra@@ y the@@ e . and the man refused to sm@@ ite him .
and as TH@@ Y ser@@ vant was busy here and there , he was gone . and the king of Israel said un@@ to him , S@@ o shall TH@@ Y judgment be ; th@@ y@@ self h@@ ast decided it .
so she wrote letters in A@@ ha@@ b 's name , and sealed them with his se@@ al , and sent the letters un@@ to the el@@ ders and to the no@@ bles that were in his city , d@@ wel@@ ling with Nab@@ o@@ th .
and set two men , sons of Bel@@ ial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent un@@ to them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent un@@ to them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
arise , go down to meet A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , which is in Samar@@ ia : be@@ hold , he is in the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th , w@@ hi@@ ther he is gone down to poss@@ ess it .
be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon the@@ e , and will take away TH@@ Y poster@@ ity , and will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provoc@@ ation where@@ with th@@ ou h@@ ast provoked me to an@@ ger , and made Israel to sin .
him that di@@ eth of A@@ ha@@ b in the city the do@@ gs shall eat ; and him that di@@ eth in the field shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat .
and he did very ab@@ omin@@ ably in following id@@ ols , according to all things as did the Am@@ ori@@ tes , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard those words , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and put s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th upon his f@@ les@@ h , and fas@@ ted , and lay in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went sof@@ tly .
and it came to pass in the third year , that J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h came down to the king of Israel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said un@@ to the king of Israel , inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , having put on their rob@@ es , in a vo@@ id place in the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and he said , He@@ ar th@@ ou therefore the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his th@@ r@@ one , and all the host of heav@@ en standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bo@@ w at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the har@@ ness : where@@ fore he said un@@ to the driver of his char@@ i@@ ot , Tur@@ n th@@ ine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wo@@ und into the mid@@ st of the char@@ i@@ ot .
and there went a proc@@ lamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
and one was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot in the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they was@@ hed his arm@@ our ; according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ ha@@ b , and all that he did , and the Iv@@ ory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and he walked in all the ways of A@@ SA his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se yet in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he she@@ wed , and how he war@@ red , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David his father : and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin :
but the an@@ gel of the Lord said to Eli@@ j@@ ah the T@@ ish@@ bi@@ te , arise , go up to meet the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the king of Samar@@ ia , and say un@@ to them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b the go@@ d of E@@ kr@@ on ?
then the king sent un@@ to him a captain of fif@@ ty with his fif@@ ty . and he went up to him : and , be@@ hold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he sp@@ ake un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u man of God , the king hat@@ h said , C@@ ome down .
be@@ hold , there came fire down from heav@@ en , and bur@@ n@@ t up the two cap@@ tains of the former fif@@ ties with their fif@@ ties : therefore let my life now be pre@@ ci@@ ous in TH@@ Y sight .
so he died according to the word of the Lord which Eli@@ j@@ ah had spoken . and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead in the second year of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when the Lord would take up Eli@@ j@@ ah into heav@@ en by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , that Eli@@ j@@ ah went with E@@ lis@@ ha from G@@ ilg@@ al .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took his man@@ tle , and wrapped it together , and smo@@ te the waters , and they were divided hi@@ ther and th@@ ither , so that they two went over on d@@ ry ground .
and he said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if th@@ ou see me when I am taken from the@@ e , it shall be so un@@ to the@@ e ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , be@@ hold , there appeared a char@@ i@@ ot of fire , and hor@@ ses of fire , and par@@ ted them both as@@ under ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind into heav@@ en .
and E@@ lis@@ ha saw it , and he cri@@ ed , My father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ se@@ men there@@ of . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clo@@ th@@ es , and rent them in two pieces .
he took up also the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and he took the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and smo@@ te the waters , and said , W@@ here is the Lord God of Eli@@ j@@ ah ? and when he also had s@@ mit@@ ten the waters , they par@@ ted hi@@ ther and th@@ ither : and E@@ lis@@ ha went over .
and when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah do@@ th rest on E@@ lis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
and the men of the city said un@@ to E@@ lis@@ ha , be@@ hold , I pra@@ y the@@ e , the situation of this city is pleas@@ ant , as my lor@@ d se@@ eth : but the water is na@@ ught , and the ground bar@@ ren .
and he went forth un@@ to the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , I have he@@ aled these waters ; there shall not be from th@@ ence any more death or bar@@ ren land .
and he went up from th@@ ence un@@ to Be@@ the@@ l : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mo@@ cked him , and said un@@ to him , G@@ o up , th@@ ou bal@@ d head ; go up , th@@ ou bal@@ d head .
and he turned back , and looked on them , and Cur@@ sed them in the name of the Lord . and there came forth two she be@@ ars out of the wood , and tar@@ e for@@ ty and two children of them .
and he w@@ rought ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of Ba@@ al that his father had made .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the king of E@@ dom : and they f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the c@@ attle that followed them .
and E@@ lis@@ ha said , As the Lord of hosts li@@ vet@@ h , before whom I stand , su@@ rely , were it not that I regard the presence of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , I would not look toward the@@ e , nor see the@@ e .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , Y@@ e shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that val@@ ley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your c@@ attle , and your be@@ asts .
and ye shall sm@@ ite every f@@ enced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wel@@ ls of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and it came to pass in the morning , when the meat offering was offered , that , be@@ hold , there came water by the way of E@@ dom , and the country was filled with water .
and when all the Mo@@ abi@@ tes heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on arm@@ our , and up@@ ward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one upon the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes rose up and smo@@ te the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , so that they fled before them : but they went forward s@@ mit@@ ing the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , even in their country .
and when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too sor@@ e for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even un@@ to the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
then he took his el@@ dest son that should have re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead , and offered him for a bur@@ n@@ t offering upon the wall . and there was great in@@ dign@@ ation against Israel : and they depar@@ ted from him , and returned to their own land .
and when th@@ ou art come in , th@@ ou s@@ halt shut the door upon the@@ e and upon TH@@ Y sons , and s@@ halt p@@ our out into all those vessels , and th@@ ou s@@ halt set aside that which is full .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she p@@ oured out .
and it fell on a day , that he came th@@ ither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and when the child was grown , it fell on a day , that he went out to his father to the re@@ apers .
and when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , he sat on her k@@ ne@@ es ti@@ ll noon , and then died .
and she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door upon him , and went out .
and she called un@@ to her husband , and said , S@@ end me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , one of the young men , and one of the ass@@ es , that I may run to the man of God , and come again .
then she s@@ add@@ led an ass , and said to her ser@@ vant , D@@ ri@@ ve , and go forward ; S@@ lack not TH@@ Y ri@@ ding for me , except I bid the@@ e .
so she went and came un@@ to the man of God to mount Car@@ mel . and it came to pass , when the man of God saw her af@@ ar off , that he said to Ge@@ hazi his ser@@ vant , be@@ hold , yon@@ der is that Sh@@ un@@ am@@ m@@ ite :
and when E@@ lis@@ ha was come into the house , be@@ hold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his m@@ outh upon his m@@ outh , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stret@@ ched himself upon the child ; and the f@@ les@@ h of the child wa@@ xed warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and f@@ ro ; and went up , and stret@@ ched himself upon him : and the child s@@ ne@@ ez@@ ed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and E@@ lis@@ ha came again to G@@ ilg@@ al : and there was a de@@ ar@@ th in the land ; and the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets were sitting before him : and he said un@@ to his ser@@ vant , S@@ et on the great po@@ t , and se@@ e@@ the po@@ tt@@ age for the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and one went out into the field to gather her@@ bs , and found a wild v@@ ine , and gathered there@@ of wild go@@ ur@@ ds his la@@ p full , and came and sh@@ red them into the po@@ t of po@@ tt@@ age : for they knew them not .
so they p@@ oured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were e@@ ating of the po@@ tt@@ age , that they cri@@ ed out , and said , O th@@ ou man of God , there is death in the po@@ t . and they could not eat there@@ of .
now Na@@ aman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honour@@ able , because by him the Lord had given deliver@@ ance un@@ to Syria : he was also a m@@ igh@@ ty man in val@@ our , but he was a le@@ per .
and the Syri@@ ans had gone out by companies , and had brought away cap@@ tive out of the land of Israel a little ma@@ id ; and she w@@ aited on Na@@ aman 's wife .
and one went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , Th@@ us and thus said the ma@@ id that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come un@@ to the@@ e , be@@ hold , I have there@@ with sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to the@@ e , that th@@ ou may@@ est rec@@ over him of his le@@ pro@@ sy .
and it was so , when E@@ lis@@ ha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clo@@ th@@ es , that he sent to the king , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou rent TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a pro@@ phe@@ t in Israel .
are not A@@ bana and P@@ har@@ p@@ ar , rivers of Dam@@ as@@ cus , better than all the waters of Israel ? May I not was@@ h in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a ra@@ ge .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his f@@ les@@ h came again like un@@ to the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the to@@ wer , he took them from their hand , and bes@@ to@@ wed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
let us go , we pra@@ y the@@ e , un@@ to Jordan , and take th@@ ence every man a be@@ am , and let us make us a place there , where we may d@@ well . and he answ@@ ered , G@@ o ye .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sor@@ e troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said un@@ to them , Will ye not she@@ w me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when they were come into Samar@@ ia , that E@@ lis@@ ha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , be@@ hold , they were in the mid@@ st of Samar@@ ia .
and there was a great fam@@ ine in Samar@@ ia : and , be@@ hold , they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , until an ass 's head was sold for fo@@ ur@@ score pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a ca@@ b of do@@ ve 's D@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
so we bo@@ iled my son , and did eat him : and I said un@@ to her on the next day , Gi@@ ve TH@@ Y son , that we may eat him : and she hat@@ h hi@@ d her son .
and it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and , be@@ hold , he had s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th within upon his f@@ les@@ h .
and they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go un@@ to the camp of the Syri@@ ans : and when they were come to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore they ar@@ ose and fled in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and left their ten@@ ts , and their hor@@ ses , and their ass@@ es , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and they went after them un@@ to Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of gar@@ ments and vessels , which the Syri@@ ans had cast away in their has@@ te . and the mes@@ sen@@ gers returned , and told the king .
and the people went out , and sp@@ o@@ iled the ten@@ ts of the Syri@@ ans . so a measure of fine fl@@ our was sold for a sh@@ ek@@ el , and two measures of bar@@ ley for a sh@@ ek@@ el , according to the word of the Lord .
and the woman ar@@ ose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and she went forth to cry un@@ to the king for her house and for her land .
and the king talked with Ge@@ hazi the ser@@ vant of the man of God , saying , T@@ ell me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , all the great things that E@@ lis@@ ha hat@@ h done .
and E@@ lis@@ ha came to Dam@@ as@@ cus ; and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the king of Syria was si@@ ck ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hi@@ ther .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that he took a th@@ ick clo@@ th , and di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Haz@@ a@@ el re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and in the fifth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at being then king of Ju@@ da@@ h , J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b was his wife : and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
so Jor@@ am went over to Z@@ air , and all the char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ ass@@ ed him about , and the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots : and the people fled into their ten@@ ts .
and the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and Jor@@ am sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
two and twenty years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned one year in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah , the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he was the son in law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and E@@ lis@@ ha the pro@@ phe@@ t called one of the children of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and said un@@ to him , Gir@@ d up TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , and take this box of oil in th@@ ine hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad :
and when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st th@@ ither , look out there J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his bre@@ th@@ ren , and carry him to an in@@ ner chamber ;
then take the box of oil , and p@@ our it on his head , and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , I have ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e king over Israel . then open the door , and flee , and tar@@ ry not .
and he ar@@ ose , and went into the house ; and he p@@ oured the oil on his head , and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , I have ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ ha@@ b TH@@ Y master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish : and I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and I will make the house of A@@ ha@@ b like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah :
and J@@ eh@@ u drew a bo@@ w with his full strength , and smo@@ te J@@ eh@@ or@@ am between his arms , and the ar@@ row went out at his heart , and he sun@@ k down in his char@@ i@@ ot .
and when J@@ eh@@ u was come to J@@ ez@@ reel , J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard of it ; and she pain@@ ted her face , and ti@@ red her head , and looked out at a window .
and he said , throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led on the wall , and on the hor@@ ses : and he tro@@ de her under fo@@ ot .
and they went to bur@@ y her : but they found no more of her than the s@@ kul@@ l , and the feet , and the pal@@ ms of her hands .
and A@@ ha@@ b had sev@@ enty sons in Samar@@ ia . and J@@ eh@@ u wrote letters , and sent to Samar@@ ia , un@@ to the rul@@ ers of J@@ ez@@ reel , to the el@@ ders , and to them that brought up A@@ ha@@ b 's children , saying ,
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and sle@@ w sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent him them to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Y@@ e be righ@@ te@@ ous : be@@ hold , I consp@@ ired against my master , and sle@@ w him : but who sle@@ w all these ?
know now that there shall fall un@@ to the ear@@ th nothing of the word of the Lord , which the Lord sp@@ ake concerning the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for the Lord hat@@ h done that which he sp@@ ake by his ser@@ vant Eli@@ j@@ ah .
so J@@ eh@@ u sle@@ w all that remained of the house of A@@ ha@@ b in J@@ ez@@ reel , and all his great men , and his k@@ ins@@ fol@@ ks , and his pri@@ ests , until he left him none remaining .
and when he came to Samar@@ ia , he sle@@ w all that remained un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , ti@@ ll he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
and J@@ eh@@ u sent through all Israel : and all the wor@@ ship@@ pers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was full from one end to another .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u depar@@ ted not from after them , to w@@ it , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but J@@ eh@@ u took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart : for he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , which made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he comman@@ ded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath shall even be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king .
and ye shall comp@@ ass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that co@@ me@@ th within the ran@@ ges , let him be sla@@ in : and be ye with the king as he go@@ eth out and as he co@@ me@@ th in .
and the cap@@ tains over the hundreds did according to all things that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , with them that should go out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and came to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
and to the cap@@ tains over hundreds did the pri@@ est give king David 's spe@@ ars and shi@@ elds , that were in the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right cor@@ ner of the temp@@ le to the left cor@@ ner of the temp@@ le , along by the alt@@ ar and the temp@@ le .
and when Ath@@ ali@@ ah heard the no@@ ise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temp@@ le of the Lord .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said un@@ to them , H@@ ave her forth without the ran@@ ges : and him that follow@@ eth her kill with the s@@ word . for the pri@@ est had said , Let her not be sla@@ in in the house of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the hor@@ ses came into the king 's house : and there was she sla@@ in .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down ; his al@@ tar@@ s and his images br@@ ake they in pieces thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s . and the pri@@ est appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
and he took the rul@@ ers over hundreds , and the cap@@ tains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . and he sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the kings .
and all the people of the land re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and the city was in quiet : and they sle@@ w Ath@@ ali@@ ah with the s@@ word bes@@ ide the king 's house .
let the pri@@ ests take it to them , every man of his acqu@@ ain@@ tance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever any breach shall be found .
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the ch@@ est , that the king 's s@@ cri@@ be and the high pri@@ est came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the car@@ pen@@ ters and buil@@ ders , that w@@ rought upon the house of the Lord ,
and to mas@@ ons , and he@@ wers of stone , and to buy tim@@ ber and he@@ wed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the Lord bo@@ w@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ons , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and his servants ar@@ ose , and made a con@@ spir@@ acy , and sle@@ w Jo@@ ash in the house of Mil@@ lo , which go@@ eth down to Sil@@ la .
for Joz@@ ac@@ har the son of Shi@@ me@@ ath , and Je@@ ho@@ zab@@ ad the son of Sho@@ mer , his servants , smo@@ te him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ a@@ el , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a sa@@ vi@@ our , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syri@@ ans : and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their ten@@ ts , as be@@ fore@@ time .
nevertheless they depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , who made Israel sin , but walked there@@ in : and there remained the gro@@ ve also in Samar@@ ia . )
neither did he leave of the people to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz but fif@@ ty hor@@ se@@ men , and ten char@@ i@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the d@@ ust by th@@ res@@ hing .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord ; he depar@@ ted not from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel sin : but he walked there@@ in .
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might where@@ with he fought against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and Jo@@ ash sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am sat upon his th@@ r@@ one : and Jo@@ ash was buried in Samar@@ ia with the kings of Israel .
now E@@ lis@@ ha was fallen si@@ ck of his si@@ ck@@ ness where@@ of he died . and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down un@@ to him , and we@@ pt over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ se@@ men there@@ of .
and he said to the king of Israel , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand upon the bo@@ w . and he put his hand upon it : and E@@ lis@@ ha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and E@@ lis@@ ha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes inv@@ aded the land at the coming in of the year .
and it came to pass , as they were bur@@ ying a man , that , be@@ hold , they sp@@ ied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of E@@ lis@@ ha : and when the man was let down , and touched the b@@ ones of E@@ lis@@ ha , he revi@@ ved , and stood up on his feet .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like David his father : he did according to all things as Jo@@ ash his father did .
and it came to pass , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was confirmed in his hand , that he sle@@ w his servants which had sla@@ in the king his father .
but A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah would not hear . therefore Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h looked one another in the face at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and came to Jer@@ usalem , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im un@@ to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and host@@ ages , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
now they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem : and he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish ; but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and sle@@ w him there .
and all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , which was six@@ teen years old , and made him king instead of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah the son of Jo@@ ash king of Ju@@ da@@ h Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash king of Israel began to reign in Samar@@ ia , and re@@ ig@@ ned for@@ ty and one years .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
for the Lord saw the aff@@ li@@ ction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any hel@@ per for Israel .
and the Lord said not that he would blo@@ t out the name of Israel from under heav@@ en : but he sav@@ ed them by the hand of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash .
now the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , and his might , how he war@@ red , and how he recovered Dam@@ as@@ cus , and Ham@@ ath , which belonged to Ju@@ da@@ h , for Israel , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
six@@ teen years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned two and fif@@ ty years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ ec@@ hol@@ i@@ ah of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah had done ;
and the Lord smo@@ te the king , so that he was a le@@ per un@@ to the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house . and Jo@@ th@@ am the king 's son was over the house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
and the rest of the acts of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
so A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers ; and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the city of David : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as his fa@@ thers had done : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ i@@ ah , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake un@@ to J@@ eh@@ u , saying , Th@@ y sons shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel un@@ to the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
for Men@@ a@@ hem the son of Gad@@ i went up from Tir@@ z@@ ah , and came to Samar@@ ia , and smo@@ te S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h in Samar@@ ia , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of S@@ hal@@ lum , and his con@@ spir@@ acy which he made , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not all his days from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and P@@ ul the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came against the land : and Men@@ a@@ hem gave P@@ ul a thousand tal@@ ents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the k@@ ing@@ dom in his hand .
and the rest of the acts of Men@@ a@@ hem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Pek@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
in the days of Pek@@ ah king of Israel came Ti@@ gla@@ th @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and took I@@ j@@ on , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and Jon@@ o@@ ah , and K@@ ede@@ sh , and Haz@@ or , and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Gal@@ il@@ ee , all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and carried them cap@@ tive to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a con@@ spir@@ acy against Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
and the rest of the acts of Pek@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Jer@@ us@@ ha , the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord : he did according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , ye@@ a , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria and Pek@@ ah son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah king of Israel came up to Jer@@ usalem to war : and they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed A@@ haz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria recovered E@@ la@@ th to Syria , and dra@@ ve the Jews from E@@ la@@ th : and the Syri@@ ans came to E@@ la@@ th , and d@@ wel@@ t there un@@ to this day .
so A@@ haz sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to Ti@@ gla@@ th @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , saying , I am TH@@ Y ser@@ vant and TH@@ Y son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to him : for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a went up against Dam@@ as@@ cus , and took it , and carried the people of it cap@@ tive to K@@ ir , and sle@@ w Re@@ z@@ in .
and U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est built an alt@@ ar according to all that king A@@ haz had sent from Dam@@ as@@ cus : so U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est made it against king A@@ haz came from Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and when the king was come from Dam@@ as@@ cus , the king saw the alt@@ ar : and the king appro@@ ached to the alt@@ ar , and offered there@@ on .
and he bur@@ n@@ t his bur@@ n@@ t offering and his meat offering , and p@@ oured his drink offering , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood of his peace offer@@ ings , upon the alt@@ ar .
and he brought also the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , which was before the Lord , from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between the alt@@ ar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the alt@@ ar .
and king A@@ haz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the lav@@ er from off them ; and took down the sea from off the br@@ as@@ en ox@@ en that were under it , and put it upon a pav@@ ement of stones .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a took Samar@@ ia , and carried Israel away into As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and placed them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des .
and walked in the stat@@ utes of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secre@@ tly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the f@@ enced city .
and there they bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in all the high places , as did the he@@ a@@ then whom the Lord carried away before them ; and w@@ rought w@@ ic@@ ked things to prov@@ oke the Lord to an@@ ger :
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they would not hear , but har@@ dened their nec@@ ks , like to the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
and they left all the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord their God , and made them m@@ ol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made a gro@@ ve , and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served Ba@@ al .
and they caused their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and en@@ chan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
and the Lord rejected all the se@@ ed of Israel , and aff@@ lic@@ ted them , and delivered them into the hand of sp@@ o@@ ilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at king : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am dra@@ ve Israel from following the Lord , and made them sin a great sin .
for the children of Israel walked in all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he did ; they depar@@ ted not from them ;
until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets . so was Israel carried away out of their own land to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a un@@ to this day .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a brought men from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and from Cu@@ th@@ ah , and from Av@@ a , and from Ham@@ ath , and from Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , and placed them in the cities of Samar@@ ia instead of the children of Israel : and they poss@@ essed Samar@@ ia , and d@@ wel@@ t in the cities there@@ of .
and so it was at the beginning of their d@@ wel@@ ling there , that they fear@@ ed not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent li@@ ons among them , which sle@@ w some of them .
then the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a comman@@ ded , saying , Car@@ ry th@@ ither one of the pri@@ ests whom ye brought from th@@ ence ; and let them go and d@@ well there , and let him te@@ ach them the manner of the God of the land .
then one of the pri@@ ests whom they had carried away from Samar@@ ia came and d@@ wel@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l , and ta@@ ught them how they should fear the Lord .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it every nation made go@@ ds of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samar@@ it@@ ans had made , every nation in their cities where@@ in they d@@ wel@@ t .
and the men of Bab@@ yl@@ on made Suc@@ co@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ben@@ o@@ th , and the men of C@@ ut@@ h made Ner@@ gal , and the men of Ham@@ ath made Ash@@ ima ,
so they fear@@ ed the Lord , and made un@@ to themselves of the lowest of them pri@@ ests of the high places , which sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for them in the houses of the high places .
with whom the Lord had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and charged them saying , Y@@ e shall not fear other go@@ ds , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them :
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stret@@ ched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , and the law , and the comman@@ d@@ ment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for ever@@ more ; and ye shall not fear other go@@ ds .
and the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I have made with you ye shall not forget ; neither shall ye fear other go@@ ds .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was A@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father did .
he removed the high places , and br@@ ake the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves , and br@@ ake in pieces the br@@ as@@ en ser@@ p@@ ent that Mos@@ es had made : for un@@ to those days the children of Israel did bur@@ n incen@@ se to it : and he called it Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ tan .
he tr@@ usted in the Lord God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor any that were before him .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a did carry away Israel un@@ to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des :
because they obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord their God , but trans@@ g@@ ressed his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and all that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded , and would not hear them , nor do them .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time did H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temp@@ le of the Lord , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent T@@ artan and R@@ ab@@ sar@@ is and Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great host against Jer@@ usalem . and they went up and came to Jer@@ usalem . and when they were come up , they came and stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , which is in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order .
T@@ ho@@ u say@@ est , ( but they are but v@@ ain words , ) I have coun@@ sel and strength for the war . now on whom dost th@@ ou trust , that th@@ ou rebel@@ lest against me ?
now , be@@ hold , th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test upon the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man le@@ an , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it : so is P@@ har@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt un@@ to all that trust on him .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give pledges to my lor@@ d the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will deliver the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h stood and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a :
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
H@@ ath any of the go@@ ds of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
where are the go@@ ds of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ p@@ ad ? where are the go@@ ds of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , H@@ ena , and Iv@@ ah ? have they delivered Samar@@ ia out of mine hand ?
then came Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es rent , and told him the words of Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h .
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and they said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , This day is a day of trouble , and of re@@ bu@@ ke , and b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land .
and when he heard say of Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , be@@ hold , he is come out to fight against the@@ e : he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers again un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed ; as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in T@@ hel@@ as@@ ar ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter of the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah pray@@ ed before the Lord , and said , O Lord God of Israel , which d@@ wel@@ lest between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , th@@ ou art the God , even th@@ ou alone , of all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th : th@@ ou h@@ ast made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
Lord , bo@@ w down th@@ ine e@@ ar , and hear : open , Lord , th@@ ine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b , which hat@@ h sent him to re@@ pro@@ ach the living God .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , save th@@ ou us out of his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that th@@ ou art the Lord God , even th@@ ou only .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste f@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded ; they were as the gr@@ ass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as cor@@ n b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
because TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me and TH@@ Y t@@ um@@ ult is come up into mine e@@ ars , therefore I will put my ho@@ ok in TH@@ Y n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and I will turn the@@ e back by the way by which th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
for out of Jer@@ usalem shall go forth a re@@ mn@@ ant , and they that escape out of mount Z@@ ion : the z@@ e@@ al of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , He shall not come into this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and it came to pass that night , that the an@@ gel of the Lord went out , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans an hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons smo@@ te him with the s@@ word : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and E@@ sar @@@ -@@ @ h@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , O Lord , remember now how I have walked before the@@ e in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in TH@@ Y sight . and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah we@@ pt sor@@ e .
and it came to pass , a@@ fore I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
and I will add un@@ to TH@@ Y days fif@@ teen years ; and I will deliver the@@ e and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake .
and I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah said , This sign s@@ halt th@@ ou have of the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing that he hat@@ h spoken : shall the shadow go forth ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : n@@ ay , but let the shadow return back@@ ward ten degrees .
and I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord : and he brought the shadow ten degrees back@@ ward , by which it had gone down in the di@@ al of A@@ haz .
at that time Ber@@ od@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ adan , the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah : for he had heard that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had been si@@ ck .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store un@@ to this day , shall be carried into Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a con@@ du@@ it , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign , and re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Hep@@ h@@ zi @@@ -@@ @ bah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built up again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had destroyed ; and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for Ba@@ al , and made a gro@@ ve , as did A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel ; and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served them .
and he built al@@ tar@@ s in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord said , In Jer@@ usalem will I put my name .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and dealt with familiar spir@@ its and w@@ iz@@ ards : he w@@ rought much w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
and I will for@@ sake the re@@ mn@@ ant of mine inher@@ it@@ ance , and deliver them into the hand of their enem@@ ies ; and they shall become a pre@@ y and a sp@@ oil to all their enem@@ ies ;
because they have done that which was ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even un@@ to this day .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the gar@@ den of his own house , in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Am@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Am@@ on was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th , the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the id@@ ols that his father served , and wor@@ shi@@ pped them :
and the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Am@@ on which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty and one years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ da@@ h , the daughter of A@@ dai@@ ah of Bos@@ c@@ ath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the ke@@ epers of the door have gathered of the people :
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there was no rec@@ kon@@ ing made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully .
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est said un@@ to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Th@@ y servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sahi@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , and A@@ ch@@ bor , and Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ sahi@@ ah , went un@@ to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah , the son of Har@@ has , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem in the colle@@ ge ; ) and they commun@@ ed with her .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h read :
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wr@@ ath shall be kin@@ d@@ led against this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h which sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , As tou@@ ching the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
be@@ hold therefore , I will gather the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be gathered into TH@@ Y grave in peace ; and th@@ ine eyes shall not see all the ev@@ il which I will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
and he brought out the gro@@ ve from the house of the Lord , without Jer@@ usalem , un@@ to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and st@@ amp@@ ed it small to pow@@ der , and cast the pow@@ der there@@ of upon the graves of the children of the people .
nevertheless the pri@@ ests of the high places came not up to the alt@@ ar of the Lord in Jer@@ usalem , but they did eat of the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread among their bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he def@@ iled Top@@ het@@ h , which is in the val@@ ley of the children of Hin@@ no@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mo@@ le@@ ch .
and the al@@ tar@@ s that were on the top of the up@@ per chamber of A@@ haz , which the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h had made , and the al@@ tar@@ s which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down , and br@@ ake them down from th@@ ence , and cast the d@@ ust of them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he br@@ ake in pieces the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves , and filled their places with the b@@ ones of men .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samar@@ ia , which the kings of Israel had made to prov@@ oke the Lord to an@@ ger , Jos@@ i@@ ah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Be@@ the@@ l .
su@@ rely there was not hol@@ den such a pass@@ over from the days of the judges that jud@@ ged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and like un@@ to him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his sou@@ l , and with all his might , according to all the law of Mos@@ es ; neither after him ar@@ ose there any like him .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the Lord turned not from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , where@@ with his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ations that Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him with@@ al .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and his servants carried him in a char@@ i@@ ot dead from Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and buried him in his own se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re . and the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fa@@ thers had done .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h put him in bands at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jer@@ usalem ; and put the land to a tri@@ bute of an hundred tal@@ ents of silver , and a tal@@ ent of gold .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h made Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king in the room of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , and turned his name to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .

and the Lord sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and bands of the Syri@@ ans , and bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Ju@@ da@@ h to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had taken from the river of Egypt un@@ to the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was E@@ igh@@ teen years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem three months . and his mother 's name was Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ ta , the daughter of El@@ na@@ than of Jer@@ usalem .

and Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came against the city , and his servants did bes@@ i@@ ege it .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h went out to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his officers : and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried out th@@ ence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temp@@ le of the Lord , as the Lord had said .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah his father 's brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im had done .
for through the an@@ ger of the Lord it came to pass in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he , and all his host , against Jer@@ usalem , and pit@@ ched against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the fam@@ ine prev@@ ailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
and the army of the Chal@@ de@@ es pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took him in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and all his army were sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
and they sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan , captain of the guard , a ser@@ vant of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem :
and he bur@@ n@@ t the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and every great man 's house bur@@ n@@ t he with fire .
and all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ es , that were with the captain of the guard , br@@ ake down the walls of Jer@@ usalem round about .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the re@@ mn@@ ant of the multi@@ tude , did Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the Lord , did the Chal@@ de@@ es break in pieces , and carried the br@@ ass of them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and all the vessels of br@@ ass where@@ with they minist@@ ered , took they away .
and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
the two pil@@ lars , one sea , and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord ; the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
and Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan captain of the guard took these , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah :
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te them , and sle@@ w them at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away out of their land .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , ru@@ ler .
and when all the cap@@ tains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah governor , there came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and Johan@@ an the son of C@@ are@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of a Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , they and their men .

but it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ es that were with him at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
and all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the armies , ar@@ ose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ es .
and his allow@@ ance was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .
and Can@@ a@@ an beg@@ at Z@@ id@@ on his fir@@ st@@ born , and H@@ eth ,

( and his daughter was S@@ her@@ ah , who built Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , and the up@@ per , and Uz@@ zen @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ er@@ ah . )
and Rep@@ ha@@ h was his son , also Res@@ hep@@ h , and Te@@ lah his son , and Tah@@ an his son ,
and their pos@@ sessions and habi@@ tations were , Be@@ the@@ l and the towns there@@ of , and eas@@ tw@@ ard Na@@ ar@@ an , and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard Ge@@ zer , with the towns there@@ of ; Sh@@ ec@@ hem also and the towns there@@ of , un@@ to Gaza and the towns there@@ of :
and by the borders of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , D@@ or and her towns . in these d@@ wel@@ t the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of As@@ her , heads of their father 's house , choice and m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , chief of the pr@@ inces . and the number throughout the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of them that were ap@@ t to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
and these are the sons of E@@ h@@ ud : these are the heads of the fa@@ thers of the inhabitants of Ge@@ ba , and they removed them to Man@@ ah@@ ath :
and N@@ er beg@@ at K@@ ish , and K@@ ish beg@@ at Sa@@ ul , and Sa@@ ul beg@@ at Jon@@ athan , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al .
and the sons of U@@ lam were m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , ar@@ chers , and had many sons , and sons ' sons , an hundred and fif@@ ty . all these are of the sons of Benjamin .
so all Israel were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies ; and , be@@ hold , they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , who were carried away to Bab@@ yl@@ on for their trans@@ gres@@ sion .
now the first inhabitants that d@@ wel@@ t in their pos@@ sessions in their cities were , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes , the pri@@ ests , L@@ evi@@ tes , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims .
and in Jer@@ usalem d@@ wel@@ t of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin , and of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ;
U@@ th@@ ai the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud , the son of Om@@ ri , the son of Im@@ ri , the son of Ban@@ i , of the children of P@@ har@@ ez the son of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and of the sons of Benjamin ; Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Ho@@ da@@ vi@@ ah , the son of Has@@ en@@ u@@ ah ,
and I@@ b@@ ne@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and E@@ lah the son of Uz@@ zi , the son of Mic@@ hri , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of S@@ hep@@ ha@@ th@@ i@@ ah , the son of Re@@ uel , the son of I@@ b@@ ni@@ j@@ ah ;
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , according to their generations , nine hundred and fif@@ ty and six . all these men were chief of the fa@@ thers in the house of their fa@@ thers .
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the house of God ;
and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ma@@ asi@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of Jah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ lem@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , a thousand and seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God .
and of the L@@ evi@@ tes ; Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ass@@ hub , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of Has@@ habi@@ ah , of the sons of Mer@@ ari ;
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of A@@ SA , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
all these which were chosen to be por@@ ters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were rec@@ kon@@ ed by their gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the se@@ er did or@@ da@@ in in their set office .
so they and their children had the over@@ sight of the gates of the house of the Lord , name@@ ly , the house of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , by wards .
for these L@@ evi@@ tes , the four chief por@@ ters , were in their set office , and were over the ch@@ ambers and treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God .
some of them also were appointed to over@@ see the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .
and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , one of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who was the fir@@ st@@ born of S@@ hal@@ lum the Kor@@ ah@@ ite , had the set office over the things that were made in the p@@ ans .
and other of their bre@@ th@@ ren , of the sons of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , were over the she@@ w@@ bread , to prepare it every sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and these are the singers , chief of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who remaining in the ch@@ ambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night .
and N@@ er beg@@ at K@@ ish ; and K@@ ish beg@@ at Sa@@ ul ; and Sa@@ ul beg@@ at Jon@@ athan , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard after Sa@@ ul , and after his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines sle@@ w Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , the sons of Sa@@ ul .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the val@@ ley saw that they fled , and that Sa@@ ul and his sons were dead , then they for@@ so@@ ok their cities , and fled : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his sons fallen in mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
and when they had stri@@ pped him , they took his head , and his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to carry ti@@ dings un@@ to their id@@ ols , and to the people .
they ar@@ ose , all the val@@ i@@ ant men , and took away the body of Sa@@ ul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and buried their b@@ ones under the o@@ ak in J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and fas@@ ted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Sa@@ ul was king , th@@ ou w@@ ast he that led@@ dest out and b@@ rough@@ test in Israel : and the Lord TH@@ Y God said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fe@@ ed my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be ru@@ ler over my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be ru@@ ler over my people Israel .
these also are the chief of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his k@@ ing@@ dom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
he was with David at p@@ as @@@ -@@ @ dam@@ m@@ im , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where was a par@@ cel of ground full of bar@@ ley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and they set themselves in the mid@@ st of that par@@ cel , and delivered it , and sle@@ w the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and the Lord sav@@ ed them by a great deliver@@ ance .
now three of the thirty cap@@ tains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and the three br@@ ake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to the Lord ,
and Ab@@ is@@ hai the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , he sle@@ w them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honour@@ able than the two ; for he was their captain : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it he at@@ tained not to the first three .
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done many acts ; he sle@@ w two li@@ on@@ like men of Mo@@ a@@ b : also he went down and sle@@ w a lion in a p@@ it in a snow@@ y day .
I@@ th@@ ai the son of Ri@@ ba@@ i of Gi@@ be@@ ah , that per@@ tained to the children of Benjamin , Ben@@ ai@@ ah the Pi@@ ra@@ th@@ on@@ ite ,
now these are they that came to David to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , while he yet kept himself close because of Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish : and they were among the m@@ igh@@ ty men , hel@@ pers of the war .
they were armed with bo@@ ws , and could use both the right hand and the left in hur@@ ling stones and shooting ar@@ ro@@ ws out of a bo@@ w , even of Sa@@ ul 's bre@@ th@@ ren of Benjamin .
the chief was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er , then Jo@@ ash , the sons of Sh@@ em@@ a@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ ath@@ ite ; and J@@ ez@@ i@@ el , and P@@ ele@@ t , the sons of Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth ; and Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and J@@ eh@@ u the An@@ to@@ th@@ ite ,
and Is@@ ma@@ i@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el , and Johan@@ an , and Jos@@ ab@@ ad the G@@ eder@@ ath@@ ite ,
these were of the sons of G@@ ad , cap@@ tains of the host : one of the least was over an hundred , and the greatest over a thousand .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flo@@ wn all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , and Michael , and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and Eli@@ hu , and Zil@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of the thousands that were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
and they helped David against the band of the ro@@ vers : for they were all m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , and were cap@@ tains in the host .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
and Zad@@ ok , a young man m@@ igh@@ ty of val@@ our , and of his father 's house twenty and two cap@@ tains .
and of the children of Benjamin , the kin@@ d@@ red of Sa@@ ul , three thousand : for hi@@ ther@@ to the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Sa@@ ul .
and of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im twenty thousand and eight hundred , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , famous throughout the house of their fa@@ thers .
and of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their bre@@ th@@ ren were at their comman@@ d@@ ment .
and on the other side of Jordan , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , with all manner of instruments of war for the battle , an hundred and twenty thousand .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation said that they would do so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
and they carried the Ar@@ k of God in a new c@@ art out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b : and Uz@@ za and A@@ hi@@ o dra@@ ve the c@@ art .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ za , and he smo@@ te him , because he put his hand to the Ar@@ k : and there he died before God .
so David brought not the Ar@@ k home to himself to the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel , for his k@@ ing@@ dom was lifted up on high , because of his people Israel .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that David was ano@@ in@@ ted king over all Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to seek David . and David heard of it , and went out against them .
therefore David inqu@@ ired again of God ; and God said un@@ to him , G@@ o not up after them ; turn away from them , and come upon them over against the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou s@@ halt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then th@@ ou s@@ halt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before the@@ e to sm@@ ite the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the Lord un@@ to his place , which he had prepared for it .
of the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h ; U@@ ri@@ el the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren an hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Mer@@ ari ; A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m ; Jo@@ el the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren an hundred and thirty :
of the sons of Uz@@ zi@@ el ; Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b the chief , and his bre@@ th@@ ren an hundred and twelve .
and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are the chief of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes : sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , both ye and your bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye may bring up the Ar@@ k of the Lord God of Israel un@@ to the place that I have prepared for it .
for because ye did it not at the first , the Lord our God made a breach upon us , for that we sought him not after the due order .
and the children of the L@@ evi@@ tes b@@ are the Ar@@ k of God upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders with the st@@ aves there@@ on , as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded according to the word of the Lord .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes to appoint their bre@@ th@@ ren to be the singers with instruments of musi@@ ck , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his bre@@ th@@ ren , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their bre@@ th@@ ren , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
so the singers , H@@ eman , A@@ sap@@ h , and E@@ than , were appointed to sound with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als of br@@ ass ;
and She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and A@@ mas@@ ai , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , the pri@@ ests , did blow with the tr@@ ump@@ ets before the Ar@@ k of God : and Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom and Je@@ hi@@ ah were do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers for the Ar@@ k .
so David , and the el@@ ders of Israel , and the cap@@ tains over thousands , went to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom with joy .
and it came to pass , when God helped the L@@ evi@@ tes that b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , that they offered seven bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven r@@ ams .
and David was clo@@ th@@ ed with a ro@@ be of fine lin@@ en , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes that b@@ are the Ar@@ k , and the singers , and Chen@@ an@@ i@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ep@@ ho@@ d of lin@@ en .
thus all Israel brought up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with sound of the cor@@ net , and with tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , making a no@@ ise with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps .
and it came to pass , as the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord came to the city of David , that Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul looking out at a window saw king David dan@@ cing and playing : and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
so they brought the Ar@@ k of God , and set it in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it : and they offered bur@@ n@@ t sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es and peace offer@@ ings before God .
and when David had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and the peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of the Lord .
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine .
A@@ sap@@ h the chief , and next to him Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , Je@@ i@@ el , and Sh@@ emir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ a@@ b , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah , and Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom : and Je@@ i@@ el with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and with har@@ ps ; but A@@ sap@@ h made a sound with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als ;
and say ye , S@@ ave us , O God of our sal@@ vation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the he@@ a@@ then , that we may give thanks to TH@@ Y hol@@ y name , and gl@@ ory in TH@@ Y praise .
so he left there before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord A@@ sap@@ h and his bre@@ th@@ ren , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required :
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord upon the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he comman@@ ded Israel ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the Lord , because his mer@@ cy en@@ du@@ re@@ th for ever ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un with tr@@ ump@@ ets and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un were por@@ ters .
and it came to pass the same night , that the word of God came to Na@@ than , saying ,
for I have not d@@ wel@@ t in an house since the day that I brought up Israel un@@ to this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tab@@ ern@@ acle to another .
now therefore thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to my ser@@ vant David , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , I took the@@ e from the she@@ ep@@ co@@ te , even from following the she@@ ep , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be ru@@ ler over my people Israel :
and I have been with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou h@@ ast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies from before the@@ e , and have made the@@ e a name like the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , when TH@@ Y days be expired that th@@ ou must go to be with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , that I will raise up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall be of TH@@ Y sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mer@@ cy away from him , as I took it from him that was before the@@ e :
and yet this was a small thing in th@@ ine eyes , O God ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast also spoken of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come , and h@@ ast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
O Lord , for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's sake , and according to th@@ ine own heart , h@@ ast th@@ ou done all this gre@@ at@@ ness , in making known all these great things .
now therefore let it ple@@ ase the@@ e to b@@ less the house of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , that it may be before the@@ e for ever : for th@@ ou b@@ les@@ s@@ est , O Lord , and it shall be b@@ les@@ sed for ever .
now after this it came to pass , that David smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sub@@ du@@ ed them , and took G@@ ath and her towns out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to help Had@@ are@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans two and twenty thousand men .
and David took the shi@@ elds of gold that were on the servants of Had@@ are@@ zer , and brought them to Jer@@ usalem .
likewise from Ti@@ b@@ hat@@ h , and from Ch@@ un , cities of Had@@ are@@ zer , brought David very much br@@ ass , where@@ with Solomon made the br@@ as@@ en sea , and the pil@@ lars , and the vessels of br@@ ass .
them also king David dedicated un@@ to the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ a@@ b , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
and Zad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the pri@@ ests ; and S@@ hav@@ s@@ ha was s@@ cri@@ be ;
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ i@@ ten of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the pri@@ ests ; and S@@ hav@@ s@@ ha was s@@ cri@@ be ;
now it came to pass after this , that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon died , and his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
and he said , If the Syri@@ ans be too strong for me , then th@@ ou s@@ halt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for the@@ e , then I will help the@@ e .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b came to Jer@@ usalem .
and when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and David took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head , and found it to we@@ igh a tal@@ ent of gold , and there were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones in it ; and it was set upon David 's head : and he brought also exceeding much sp@@ oil out of the city .
and it came to pass after this , that there ar@@ ose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; at which time Si@@ b@@ bec@@ hai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite sle@@ w S@@ ip@@ p@@ ai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were sub@@ du@@ ed .
and yet again there was war at G@@ ath , where was a man of great stat@@ ure , whose fin@@ gers and to@@ es were four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each fo@@ ot : and he also was the son of the giant .
and Jo@@ a@@ b gave the sum of the number of the people un@@ to David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew s@@ word : and Ju@@ da@@ h was four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand men that drew s@@ word .
and David said un@@ to God , I have sin@@ ned greatly , because I have done this thing : but now , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , do away the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for I have done very fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly .
and David said un@@ to G@@ ad , I am in a great stra@@ it : let me fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for very great are his mer@@ cies : but let me not fall into the hand of man .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord comman@@ ded G@@ ad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
and David built there an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings , and called upon the Lord ; and he answ@@ ered him from heav@@ en by fire upon the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering .
for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord , which Mos@@ es made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , were at that season in the high place at Gi@@ be@@ on .
and David comman@@ ded to gather together the st@@ ran@@ gers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set mas@@ ons to he@@ w w@@ rought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in ab@@ und@@ ance for the n@@ ails for the doors of the gates , and for the join@@ ings ; and br@@ ass in ab@@ und@@ ance without weight ;
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house un@@ to the name of the Lord my God :
but the word of the Lord came to me , saying , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast shed blood ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and h@@ ast made great wars : th@@ ou s@@ halt not build an house un@@ to my name , because th@@ ou h@@ ast shed much blood upon the ear@@ th in my sight .
only the Lord give the@@ e wis@@ dom and understanding , and give the@@ e charge concerning Israel , that th@@ ou may@@ est keep the law of the Lord TH@@ Y God .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou prosp@@ er , if th@@ ou tak@@ est heed to fulfil the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which the Lord charged Mos@@ es with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dre@@ ad not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed .
now , be@@ hold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand tal@@ ents of gold , and a thousand thousand tal@@ ents of silver ; and of br@@ ass and iron without weight ; for it is in ab@@ und@@ ance : tim@@ ber also and stone have I prepared ; and th@@ ou may@@ est add there@@ to .
moreover there are work@@ men with the@@ e in ab@@ und@@ ance , he@@ wers and workers of stone and tim@@ ber , and all manner of c@@ un@@ ning men for every manner of work .
of the gold , the silver , and the br@@ ass , and the iron , there is no number . arise therefore , and be doing , and the Lord be with the@@ e .
now the L@@ evi@@ tes were num@@ ber@@ ed from the age of thirty years and up@@ ward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
of which , twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the Lord ; and six thousand were officers and judges :
and Jah@@ ath was the chief , and Z@@ iz@@ ah the second : but Je@@ ush and Ber@@ i@@ ah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one rec@@ kon@@ ing , according to their father 's house .
the sons of Am@@ ram ; Aaron and Mos@@ es : and Aaron was separated , that he should sanc@@ ti@@ fy the most hol@@ y things , he and his sons for ever , to bur@@ n incen@@ se before the Lord , to minister un@@ to him , and to b@@ less in his name for ever .
these were the sons of L@@ evi after the house of their fa@@ thers ; even the chief of the fa@@ thers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and up@@ ward .
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the ch@@ ambers , and in the pur@@ ifying of all hol@@ y things , and the work of the service of the house of God ;
and David distributed them , both Zad@@ ok of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , according to their offices in their service .
and there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele@@ azar than of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of Ele@@ azar there were six@@ teen chief men of the house of their fa@@ thers , and eight among the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar according to the house of their fa@@ thers .
thus were they divided by lot , one sort with another ; for the govern@@ ors of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and govern@@ ors of the house of God , were of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar .
these were the or@@ der@@ ings of them in their service to come into the house of the Lord , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the Lord God of Israel had comman@@ ded him .
of the Iz@@ har@@ ites ; S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th : of the sons of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th ; Jah@@ ath .
the sons also of Mus@@ hi ; Mah@@ li , and E@@ der , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th . these were the sons of the L@@ evi@@ tes after the house of their fa@@ thers .
moreover David and the cap@@ tains of the host separated to the service of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , and of H@@ eman , and of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , who should pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with har@@ ps , with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als : and the number of the work@@ men according to their service was :
of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h ; Z@@ acc@@ ur , and Joseph , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and As@@ are@@ lah , the sons of A@@ sap@@ h under the hands of A@@ sap@@ h , which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied according to the order of the king .
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the Lord , with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and har@@ ps , for the service of the house of God , according to the king 's order to A@@ sap@@ h , J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and H@@ eman .
so the number of them , with their bre@@ th@@ ren that were instruc@@ ted in the songs of the Lord , even all that were c@@ un@@ ning , was two hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and eight .
concerning the divisions of the por@@ ters : of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes was Mes@@ he@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of k@@ ore , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h .
also un@@ to Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons ; Sim@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him the chief ; )
among these were the divisions of the por@@ ters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the Lord .
and they cast lots , as well the small as the great , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , for every gate .
and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , A@@ hij@@ ah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Je@@ hi@@ eli ; Z@@ eth@@ am , and Jo@@ el his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the Lord .
which S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith and his bre@@ th@@ ren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fa@@ thers , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the host , had dedicated .
and all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith , and of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
among the He@@ bron@@ ites was Jer@@ ij@@ ah the chief , even among the He@@ bron@@ ites , according to the generations of his fa@@ thers . in the for@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our at Jaz@@ er of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , a chief pri@@ est : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was H@@ ele@@ z the Pel@@ on@@ ite , of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
furthermore over the tri@@ bes of Israel : the ru@@ ler of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites was Eli@@ ez@@ er the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri : of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h :
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Hos@@ he@@ a the son of Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah : of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Jo@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah :
but David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heav@@ ens .
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wr@@ ath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chron@@ ic@@ les of king David .
and over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the sto@@ re@@ houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the c@@ ast@@ les , was J@@ eh@@ on@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and over them that did the work of the field for til@@ la@@ ge of the ground was E@@ z@@ ri the son of C@@ hel@@ u@@ b :
and over the olive trees and the sy@@ com@@ ore trees that were in the low pla@@ ins was Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ han@@ an the G@@ eder@@ ite : and over the cel@@ lars of oil was Jo@@ ash :
and over the her@@ ds that f@@ ed in Shar@@ on was Sh@@ it@@ ra@@ i the Shar@@ on@@ ite : and over the her@@ ds that were in the val@@ ley@@ s was Sha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ad@@ la@@ i :
also Jon@@ athan David 's un@@ cle was a coun@@ seller , a wise man , and a s@@ cri@@ be : and Je@@ hi@@ el the son of H@@ ach@@ mon@@ i was with the king 's sons :
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hat@@ h given me many sons , ) he hat@@ h chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom of the Lord over Israel .
and he said un@@ to me , Solomon TH@@ Y son , he shall build my house and my courts : for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
moreover I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom for ever , if he be constant to do my comman@@ d@@ ments and my judg@@ ments , as at this day .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pat@@ tern of the por@@ ch , and of the houses there@@ of , and of the treas@@ ur@@ ies there@@ of , and of the up@@ per ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and of the in@@ ner par@@ lo@@ urs there@@ of , and of the place of the mer@@ cy seat ,
and the pat@@ tern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the ch@@ ambers round about , of the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God , and of the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the dedicated things :
also for the courses of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of gold , and for their lam@@ ps of gold , by weight for every cand@@ le@@ stick , and for the lam@@ ps there@@ of : and for the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of silver by weight , both for the cand@@ le@@ stick , and also for the lam@@ ps there@@ of , according to the use of every cand@@ le@@ stick .
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of she@@ w@@ bread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
also p@@ ure gold for the fle@@ sh@@ ho@@ oks , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the c@@ ups : and for the golden bas@@ ons he gave gold by weight for every bas@@ on ; and likewise silver by weight for every bas@@ on of silver :
and for the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se refin@@ ed gold by weight ; and gold for the pat@@ tern of the char@@ i@@ ot of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , that spread out their w@@ ings , and covered the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord .
furthermore David the king said un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , Solomon my son , whom alone God hat@@ h chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the Lord God .
moreover , because I have set my aff@@ ection to the house of my God , I have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the hol@@ y house ,
even three thousand tal@@ ents of gold , of the gold of Op@@ hir , and seven thousand tal@@ ents of refin@@ ed silver , to over@@ lay the walls of the houses with@@ al :
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of arti@@ fic@@ ers . and who then is willing to consec@@ rate his service this day un@@ to the Lord ?
then the chief of the fa@@ thers and pr@@ inces of the tri@@ bes of Israel , and the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rul@@ ers of the king 's work , offered will@@ ingly ,
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand tal@@ ents and ten thousand dr@@ ams , and of silver ten thousand tal@@ ents , and of br@@ ass E@@ igh@@ teen thousand tal@@ ents , and one hundred thousand tal@@ ents of iron .
and they with whom pre@@ ci@@ ous stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Je@@ hi@@ el the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite .
then the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , for that they offered will@@ ingly , because with perfect heart they offered will@@ ingly to the Lord : and David the king also re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy .
Th@@ ine , O Lord , is the gre@@ at@@ ness , and the power , and the gl@@ ory , and the victory , and the maj@@ es@@ ty : for all that is in the heav@@ en and in the ear@@ th is th@@ ine ; th@@ ine is the k@@ ing@@ dom , O Lord , and th@@ ou art ex@@ al@@ ted as head above all .
both ri@@ ches and honour come of the@@ e , and th@@ ou re@@ ign@@ est over all ; and in th@@ ine hand is power and might ; and in th@@ ine hand it is to make great , and to give strength un@@ to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so will@@ ingly after this sort ? for all things come of the@@ e , and of th@@ ine own have we given the@@ e .
for we are st@@ ran@@ gers before the@@ e , and so@@ jour@@ ners , as were all our fa@@ thers : our days on the ear@@ th are as a shadow , and there is none abi@@ ding .
O Lord our God , all this store that we have prepared to build the@@ e an house for th@@ ine hol@@ y name co@@ me@@ th of th@@ ine hand , and is all th@@ ine own .
O Lord God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , I@@ sa@@ ac , and of Israel , our fa@@ thers , keep this for ever in the imag@@ ination of the th@@ ou@@ ghts of the heart of TH@@ Y people , and prepare their heart un@@ to the@@ e :
and give un@@ to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , and TH@@ Y stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es un@@ to the Lord , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , on the mor@@ row after that day , even a thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks , a thousand r@@ ams , and a thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance for all Israel :
and the Lord mag@@ ni@@ fied Solomon exce@@ ed@@ ingly in the sight of all Israel , and bes@@ to@@ wed upon him such royal maj@@ es@@ ty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
and the time that he re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel was for@@ ty years ; seven years re@@ ig@@ ned he in He@@ br@@ on , and thirty and three years re@@ ig@@ ned he in Jer@@ usalem .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of Samuel the se@@ er , and in the book of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the book of G@@ ad the se@@ er ,
and Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his k@@ ing@@ dom , and the Lord his God was with him , and mag@@ ni@@ fied him exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
then Solomon sp@@ ake un@@ to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fa@@ thers .
so Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but the Ar@@ k of God had David brought up from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jer@@ usalem .
moreover the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , he put before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Con@@ gre@@ gation sought un@@ to it .
and Solomon went up th@@ ither to the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar before the Lord , which was at the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and offered a thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings upon it .
now , O Lord God , let TH@@ Y promise un@@ to David my father be established : for th@@ ou h@@ ast made me king over a people like the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in multi@@ tude .
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on to Jer@@ usalem , from before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel .
and the king made silver and gold at Jer@@ usalem as plen@@ te@@ ous as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ar trees made he as the sy@@ com@@ ore trees that are in the val@@ e for ab@@ und@@ ance .
and Solomon had hor@@ ses brought out of Egypt , and lin@@ en yar@@ n : the king 's mer@@ chan@@ ts received the lin@@ en yar@@ n at a price .
and they f@@ et@@ ched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a char@@ i@@ ot for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and an hor@@ se for an hundred and fif@@ ty : and so brought they out hor@@ ses for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
and Solomon sent to Hur@@ am the king of T@@ y@@ re , saying , As th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st deal with David my father , and di@@ d@@ st send him c@@ ed@@ ars to build him an house to d@@ well there@@ in , even so deal with me .
send me also c@@ ed@@ ar trees , f@@ ir trees , and al@@ gu@@ m trees , out of Lebanon : for I know that TH@@ Y servants can sk@@ ill to cut tim@@ ber in Lebanon ; and , be@@ hold , my servants shall be with TH@@ Y servants ,
and , be@@ hold , I will give to TH@@ Y servants , the he@@ wers that cut tim@@ ber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of bar@@ ley , and twenty thousand ba@@ ths of wine , and twenty thousand ba@@ ths of oil .
now therefore the wheat , and the bar@@ ley , the oil , and the wine , which my lor@@ d hat@@ h spoken of , let him send un@@ to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as th@@ ou s@@ halt need : and we will bring it to the@@ e in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and th@@ ou shall carry it up to Jer@@ usalem .
and Solomon num@@ ber@@ ed all the st@@ ran@@ gers that were in the land of Israel , after the num@@ ber@@ ing where@@ with David his father had num@@ ber@@ ed them ; and they were found an hundred and fif@@ ty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
and he set thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand of them to be be@@ ar@@ ers of bur@@ den@@ s , and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand to be he@@ wers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred over@@ se@@ ers to set the people a work .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem in mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where the Lord appeared un@@ to David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instruc@@ ted for the building of the house of God . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the por@@ ch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight was an hundred and twenty : and he over@@ laid it within with p@@ ure gold .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the posts , and the walls there@@ of , and the doors there@@ of , with gold ; and gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the walls .
and he made the most hol@@ y house , the length where@@ of was according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred tal@@ ents .
and the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms were twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts long : one wing of the one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
and one wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts also , joining to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
also he made before the house two pil@@ lars of thirty and five cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and the chap@@ iter that was on the top of each of them was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he made cha@@ ins , as in the or@@ acle , and put them on the heads of the pil@@ lars ; and made an hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the cha@@ ins .
and he re@@ ar@@ ed up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
moreover he made an alt@@ ar of br@@ ass , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts the length there@@ of , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and ten cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of .
also he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and under it was the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of ox@@ en , which did comp@@ ass it round about : ten in a cu@@ bit , comp@@ ass@@ ing the sea round about . two ro@@ ws of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
and the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of it was an hand@@ b@@ read@@ th , and the bri@@ m of it like the work of the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , with flowers of l@@ ilies ; and it received and held three thousand ba@@ ths .
and he made ten cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temp@@ le , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temp@@ le , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred bas@@ ons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the pri@@ ests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and over@@ laid the doors of them with br@@ ass .
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end , over against the south .
and Hur@@ am made the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . and Hur@@ am finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
to w@@ it , the two pil@@ lars , and the pom@@ me@@ ls , and the chap@@ it@@ ers which were on the top of the two pil@@ lars , and the two w@@ re@@ aths to cover the two pom@@ me@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on the two w@@ re@@ aths ; two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates on each w@@ reath , to cover the two pom@@ me@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the pil@@ lars .
the po@@ ts also , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the fle@@ sh@@ ho@@ oks , and all their instruments , did Hur@@ am his father make to king Solomon for the house of the Lord of bright br@@ ass .
and the flowers , and the lam@@ ps , and the ton@@ gs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ons , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the cen@@ s@@ ers , of p@@ ure gold : and the entry of the house , the in@@ ner doors there@@ of for the most hol@@ y place , and the doors of the house of the temp@@ le , were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished : and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the chief of the fa@@ thers of the children of Israel , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves un@@ to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , these did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed she@@ ep and ox@@ en , which could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord un@@ to his place , to the or@@ acle of the house , into the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms :
and they drew out the st@@ aves of the Ar@@ k , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is un@@ to this day .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k save the two tables which Mos@@ es put there@@ in at Ho@@ re@@ b , when the Lord made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests were come out of the hol@@ y place : ( for all the pri@@ ests that were present were sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and did not then wait by course :
so that the pri@@ ests could not stand to minister by reason of the cl@@ oud : for the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the house of God .
and the king turned his face , and b@@ les@@ sed the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel : and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel stood .
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of Israel , who hat@@ h with his hands fulfilled that which he sp@@ ake with his m@@ outh to my father David , saying ,
but the Lord said to David my father , For@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing th@@ ou s@@ halt not build the house ; but TH@@ Y son which shall come forth out of TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , he shall build the house for my name .
the Lord therefore hat@@ h performed his word that he hat@@ h spoken : for I am risen up in the room of David my father , and am set on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and in it have I put the Ar@@ k , where@@ in is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , that he made with the children of Israel .
and he stood before the alt@@ ar of the Lord in the presence of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , and spread forth his hands :
and said , O Lord God of Israel , there is no God like the@@ e in the heav@@ en , nor in the ear@@ th ; which keep@@ est C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and she@@ west mer@@ cy un@@ to TH@@ Y servants , that walk before the@@ e with all their hear@@ ts :
T@@ ho@@ u which h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised him ; and sp@@ ak@@ est with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
have respect therefore to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and the pray@@ er which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place where@@ of th@@ ou h@@ ast said that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest put TH@@ Y name there ; to he@@ arken un@@ to the pray@@ er which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth toward this place .
Hear@@ ken therefore un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ations of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear th@@ ou from TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , even from heav@@ en ; and when th@@ ou hear@@ est , for@@ give .
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en , and do , and judge TH@@ Y servants , by requ@@ iting the w@@ ic@@ ked , by re@@ compen@@ sing his way upon his own head ; and by jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , by giving him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and if TH@@ Y people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e ; and shall return and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and pra@@ y and make supp@@ lic@@ ation before the@@ e in this house ;
then hear th@@ ou from the heav@@ ens , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y people Israel , and bring them again un@@ to the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est to them and to their fa@@ thers .
when the heav@@ en is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e ; yet if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and turn from their sin , when th@@ ou dost aff@@ lic@@ t them ;
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y servants , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , when th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught them the good way , where@@ in they should walk ; and send rain upon TH@@ Y land , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given un@@ to TH@@ Y people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
if there be de@@ ar@@ th in the land , if there be p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , if there be b@@ lasting , or mil@@ dew , loc@@ ust@@ s , or cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lers ; if their enem@@ ies bes@@ i@@ ege them in the cities of their land ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sor@@ e or wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever si@@ ck@@ ness there be :
then what pray@@ er or what supp@@ lic@@ ation so@@ ever shall be made of any man , or of all TH@@ Y people Israel , when every one shall know his own sor@@ e and his own gri@@ ef , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and ren@@ der un@@ to every man according un@@ to all his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou only know@@ est the hear@@ ts of the children of men : )
that they may fear the@@ e , to walk in TH@@ Y ways , so long as they live in the land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers .
moreover concerning the st@@ ran@@ ger , which is not of TH@@ Y people Israel , but is come from a far country for TH@@ Y great name 's sake , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; if they come and pra@@ y in this house ;
if TH@@ Y people go out to war against their enem@@ ies by the way that th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and they pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward this city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name ;
if they sin against the@@ e , ( for there is no man which sin@@ net@@ h not , ) and th@@ ou be angry with them , and deliver them over before their enem@@ ies , and they carry them away cap@@ tives un@@ to a land far off or near ;
yet if they be@@ think themselves in the land w@@ hi@@ ther they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn and pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , We have sin@@ ned , we have done am@@ is@@ s , and have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ;
if they return to the@@ e with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their cap@@ tivity , w@@ hi@@ ther they have carried them cap@@ tives , and pra@@ y toward their land , which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers , and toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name :
then hear th@@ ou from the heav@@ ens , even from TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , their pray@@ er and their supp@@ lic@@ ations , and maintain their cause , and for@@ give TH@@ Y people which have sin@@ ned against the@@ e .
now , my God , let , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , th@@ ine eyes be open , and let th@@ ine e@@ ars be att@@ ent un@@ to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
now therefore arise , O Lord God , into TH@@ Y resting place , th@@ ou , and the Ar@@ k of TH@@ Y strength : let TH@@ Y pri@@ ests , O Lord God , be clo@@ th@@ ed with sal@@ vation , and let TH@@ Y sa@@ ints re@@ jo@@ ice in Go@@ od@@ ness .
now when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing , the fire came down from heav@@ en , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; and the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house .
and the pri@@ ests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand ox@@ en , and an hundred and twenty thousand she@@ ep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
moreover Solomon hal@@ low@@ ed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , because the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the meat offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great Con@@ gre@@ gation , from the entering in of Ham@@ ath un@@ to the river of Egypt .
and on the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their ten@@ ts , glad and mer@@ ry in heart for the Go@@ od@@ ness that the Lord had she@@ wed un@@ to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house , he prosp@@ er@@ ously eff@@ ected .
and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night , and said un@@ to him , I have heard TH@@ Y pray@@ er , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if my people , which are called by my name , shall hum@@ ble themselves , and pra@@ y , and seek my face , and turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked ways ; then will I hear from heav@@ en , and will for@@ give their sin , and will he@@ al their land .
and as for the@@ e , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk before me , as David TH@@ Y father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and s@@ halt observe my stat@@ ues and my judg@@ ments ;
then will I st@@ ab@@ lish the th@@ r@@ one of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom , according as I have c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with David TH@@ Y father , saying , There shall not fail the@@ e a man to be ru@@ ler in Israel .
but if ye turn away , and for@@ sake my stat@@ utes and my comman@@ d@@ ments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and un@@ to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , where@@ in Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
that the cities which Hur@@ am had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to d@@ well there .
also he built Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the up@@ per , and Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , f@@ enced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Ba@@ al@@ ath , and all the store cities that Solomon had , and all the char@@ i@@ ot cities , and the cities of the hor@@ se@@ men , and all that Solomon desi@@ red to build in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and throughout all the land of his domin@@ ion .
as for all the people that were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consu@@ med not , them did Solomon make to pay tri@@ bute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and cap@@ tains of his char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men .
and these were the chief of king Solomon 's officers , even two hundred and fif@@ ty , that b@@ are rule over the people .
then Solomon offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord on the alt@@ ar of the Lord , which he had built before the por@@ ch ,
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , on the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts , three times in the year , even in the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared un@@ to the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and until it was finished . so the house of the Lord was perf@@ ected .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of th@@ ine acts , and of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom :
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , be@@ hold , the one half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom was not told me : for th@@ ou exce@@ ede@@ st the f@@ ame that I heard .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty tal@@ ents of gold , and of sp@@ ices great ab@@ und@@ ance , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : neither was there any such sp@@ ice as the qu@@ een of She@@ ba gave king Solomon .
and the servants also of Hur@@ am , and the servants of Solomon , which brought gold from Op@@ hir , brought al@@ gu@@ m trees and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and six tal@@ ents of gold ;
and there were six steps to the th@@ r@@ one , with a foot@@ st@@ ool of gold , which were fas@@ tened to the th@@ r@@ one , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two li@@ ons standing by the stays :
and twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . there was not the like made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and all the kings of the ear@@ th sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wis@@ dom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent , har@@ ness , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite , and in the visions of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er against Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at ?
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was in Egypt , w@@ hi@@ ther he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel which the old men gave him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and he said un@@ to them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , ease somewhat the yok@@ e that TH@@ Y father did put upon us ?
and the young men that were brought up with him sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou answer the people that sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Th@@ y father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make th@@ ou it somewhat ligh@@ ter for us ; thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , My little fin@@ ger shall be th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's lo@@ ins .
so the king hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the people : for the cause was of God , that the Lord might perform his word , which he sp@@ ake by the hand of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am that was over the tri@@ bute ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . but king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jer@@ usalem , he gathered of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand chosen men , which were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from exec@@ ut@@ ing the pri@@ est 's office un@@ to the Lord :
and after them out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel such as set their hear@@ ts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jer@@ usalem , to sacrifice un@@ to the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
so they strengthened the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
and he dealt wis@@ ely , and disper@@ sed of all his children throughout all the countries of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , un@@ to every f@@ enced city : and he gave them vic@@ tual in ab@@ und@@ ance . and he desi@@ red many wi@@ ves .
and it came to pass , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had established the k@@ ing@@ dom , and had strengthened himself , he for@@ so@@ ok the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , because they had trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord ,
so S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
instead of which king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king 's house .
now the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , first and last , are they not written in the book of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er concerning gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies ? and there were wars between Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am continu@@ ally .
he re@@ ig@@ ned three years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was Micha@@ i@@ ah the daughter of U@@ ri@@ el of Gi@@ be@@ ah . and there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hat@@ h rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
and there are gathered un@@ to him v@@ ain men , the children of Bel@@ ial , and have strengthened themselves against Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was young and ten@@ der@@ hear@@ ted , and could not with@@ stand them .
but as for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not for@@ sak@@ en him ; and the pri@@ ests , which minister un@@ to the Lord , are the sons of Aaron , and the L@@ evi@@ tes wait upon their business :
and , be@@ hold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his pri@@ ests with so@@ unding tr@@ ump@@ ets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the Lord God of your fa@@ thers ; for ye shall not prosp@@ er .
and when Ju@@ da@@ h looked back , be@@ hold , the battle was before and behind : and they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and the pri@@ ests so@@ unded with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it came to pass , that God smo@@ te Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and his people sle@@ w them with a great sla@@ ughter : so there fell down sla@@ in of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h prev@@ ailed , because they reli@@ ed upon the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
and A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah pursu@@ ed after Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and took cities from him , Be@@ the@@ l with the towns there@@ of , and J@@ es@@ hn@@ ah with the towns there@@ of , and E@@ ph@@ rain with the towns there@@ of .
for he took away the al@@ tar@@ s of the st@@ range go@@ ds , and the high places , and br@@ ake down the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves :
and there came out against them Zer@@ ah the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred char@@ i@@ ots ; and came un@@ to Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h .
and A@@ SA and the people that were with him pursu@@ ed them un@@ to Ger@@ ar : and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians were over@@ thrown , that they could not rec@@ over themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much sp@@ oil .
and they smo@@ te all the cities round about Ger@@ ar ; for the fear of the Lord came upon them : and they sp@@ o@@ iled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much sp@@ oil in them .
but when they in their trouble did turn un@@ to the Lord God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great v@@ ex@@ ations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
so they gathered themselves together at Jer@@ usalem in the third month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of A@@ SA .
and they offered un@@ to the Lord the same time , of the sp@@ oil which they had brought , seven hundred ox@@ en and seven thousand she@@ ep .
and they entered into a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant to seek the Lord God of their fa@@ thers with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l ;
that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
and all Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the Lord gave them rest round about .
and also concerning Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h the mother of A@@ SA the king , he removed her from being qu@@ een , because she had made an i@@ dol in a gro@@ ve : and A@@ SA cut down her i@@ dol , and st@@ amp@@ ed it , and bur@@ n@@ t it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
in the six and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of A@@ SA Ba@@ as@@ ha king of Israel came up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and built Ram@@ ah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
then A@@ SA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad king of Syria , that d@@ wel@@ t at Dam@@ as@@ cus , saying ,
and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ im , and all the store cities of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
and it came to pass , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard it , that he left off building of Ram@@ ah , and let his work ce@@ ase .
then A@@ SA the king took all Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they carried away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , where@@ with Ba@@ as@@ ha was building ; and he built there@@ with Ge@@ ba and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
and at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said un@@ to him , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast reli@@ ed on the king of Syria , and not reli@@ ed on the Lord TH@@ Y God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of th@@ ine hand .
for the eyes of the Lord run to and f@@ ro throughout the whole ear@@ th , to she@@ w himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . her@@ e@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly : therefore from hen@@ ce@@ forth th@@ ou s@@ halt have wars .
then A@@ SA was wro@@ th with the se@@ er , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a ra@@ ge with him because of this thing . and A@@ SA op@@ pressed some of the people the same time .
and , be@@ hold , the acts of A@@ SA , first and last , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and A@@ SA in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was dis@@ eased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physi@@ cians .
and he placed forces in all the f@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ SA his father had taken .
and the Lord was with J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not un@@ to Ba@@ al@@ im ;
but sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his comman@@ d@@ ments , and not after the do@@ ings of Israel .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord : moreover he took away the high places and gro@@ ves out of Ju@@ da@@ h .
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his pr@@ inces , even to Ben @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ il , and to Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and to N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and to Micha@@ i@@ ah , to te@@ ach in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and with them he sent L@@ evi@@ tes , even Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Z@@ eb@@ adi@@ ah , and A@@ sah@@ el , and Sh@@ emir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and J@@ eh@@ on@@ athan , and Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , and To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and To@@ b @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , L@@ evi@@ tes ; and with them E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am , pri@@ ests .
and they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught the people .
and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the lands that were round about Ju@@ da@@ h , so that they made no war against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at .
and he had much business in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h : and the men of war , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , were in Jer@@ usalem .
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fa@@ thers : of Ju@@ da@@ h , the cap@@ tains of thousands ; Ad@@ n@@ ah the chief , and with him m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our three hundred thousand .
and next him was A@@ mas@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , who will@@ ingly offered himself un@@ to the Lord ; and with him two hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our .
and after certain years he went down to A@@ ha@@ b to Samar@@ ia . and A@@ ha@@ b killed she@@ ep and ox@@ en for him in ab@@ und@@ ance , and for the people that he had with him , and persu@@ aded him to go up with him to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said un@@ to the king of Israel , inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat either of them on his th@@ r@@ one , clo@@ th@@ ed in their rob@@ es , and they sat in a vo@@ id place at the entering in of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and the Lord said , Wh@@ o shall enti@@ ce A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad ? and one sp@@ ake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they comp@@ ass@@ ed about him to fight : but J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to de@@ part from him .
for it came to pass , that , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bo@@ w at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the har@@ ness : therefore he said to his char@@ i@@ ot man , Tur@@ n th@@ ine hand , that th@@ ou may@@ est carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the king of Israel stayed himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at d@@ wel@@ t at Jer@@ usalem : and he went out again through the people from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba to mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and brought them back un@@ to the Lord God of their fa@@ thers .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you ; take heed and do it : for there is no in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity with the Lord our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of gifts .
moreover in Jer@@ usalem did J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at set of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and of the pri@@ ests , and of the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , for the judgment of the Lord , and for controversi@@ es , when they returned to Jer@@ usalem .
it came to pass after this also , that the children of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon , and with them other bes@@ ide the Am@@ mon@@ ites , came against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at to battle .
art not th@@ ou our God , who di@@ d@@ st drive out the inhabitants of this land before TH@@ Y people Israel , and g@@ av@@ est it to the se@@ ed of Ab@@ ra@@ ham TH@@ Y friend for ever ?
O our God , w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that co@@ me@@ th against us ; neither know we what to do : but our eyes are upon the@@ e .
then upon Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , a Lev@@ ite of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , came the Spiri@@ t of the Lord in the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
to mor@@ row go ye down against them : be@@ hold , they come up by the c@@ lif@@ f of Z@@ iz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Bro@@ ok , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at bo@@ wed his head with his face to the ground : and all Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem fell before the Lord , wor@@ shipping the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , and of the children of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a l@@ oud voice on high .
and when they began to sing and to praise , the Lord set amb@@ ush@@ ments against the children of Am@@ mon , Mo@@ a@@ b , and mount Se@@ ir , which were come against Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they were s@@ mit@@ ten .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ a@@ b stood up against the inhabitants of mount Se@@ ir , ut@@ ter@@ ly to s@@ lay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , every one helped to destroy another .
and when Ju@@ da@@ h came toward the watch to@@ wer in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , they looked un@@ to the multi@@ tude , and , be@@ hold , they were dead bodies fallen to the ear@@ th , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assemb@@ led themselves in the val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h ; for there they b@@ les@@ sed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , un@@ to this day .
then they returned , every man of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of them , to go again to Jer@@ usalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to re@@ jo@@ ice over their enem@@ ies .
and the fear of God was on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of those countries , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enem@@ ies of Israel .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and he walked in the way of A@@ SA his father , and depar@@ ted not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hear@@ ts un@@ to the God of their fa@@ thers .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of J@@ eh@@ u the son of Han@@ ani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tar@@ sh@@ ish : and they made the ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber .
now J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried with his fa@@ thers in the city of David . and J@@ eh@@ or@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he had bre@@ th@@ ren the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Michael , and She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah : all these were the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Israel .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up to the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , he strengthened himself , and sle@@ w all his bre@@ th@@ ren with the s@@ word , and di@@ vers also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b to wife : and he w@@ rought that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the Lord would not destroy the house of David , because of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
then J@@ eh@@ or@@ am went forth with his pr@@ inces , and all his char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ ass@@ ed him in , and the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots .
so the E@@ dom@@ ites revol@@ ted from under the hand of Ju@@ da@@ h un@@ to this day . the same time also did Lib@@ n@@ ah revol@@ t from under his hand ; because he had for@@ sak@@ en the Lord God of his fa@@ thers .
and there came a writing to him from Eli@@ j@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of David TH@@ Y father , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast not walked in the ways of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at TH@@ Y father , nor in the ways of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h ,
moreover the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up against J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the spirit of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and of the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , that were near the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians :
and they came up into Ju@@ da@@ h , and br@@ ake into it , and carried away all the sub@@ stance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wi@@ ves ; so that there was never a son left him , save Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the youngest of his sons .
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned in Jer@@ usalem eight years , and depar@@ ted without being desi@@ red . H@@ ow@@ be@@ it they buried him in the city of David , but not in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings .
and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem made A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his youngest son king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the Ara@@ bi@@ ans to the camp had sla@@ in all the el@@ dest . so A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ ig@@ ned .
he walked also after their coun@@ sel , and went with J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel to war against Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad : and the Syri@@ ans smo@@ te Jor@@ am .
and he returned to be he@@ aled in J@@ ez@@ reel because of the wounds which were given him at Ram@@ ah , when he fought with Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria . and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to see J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b at J@@ ez@@ reel , because he was si@@ ck .
and the destruction of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah was of God by coming to Jor@@ am : for when he was come , he went out with J@@ eh@@ or@@ am against J@@ eh@@ u the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , whom the Lord had ano@@ in@@ ted to cut off the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment upon the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the bre@@ th@@ ren of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , that minist@@ ered to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , he sle@@ w them .
but when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she ar@@ ose and destroyed all the se@@ ed royal of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada strengthened himself , and took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Ob@@ ed , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , and E@@ lis@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him .
and they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the king in the house of God . and he said un@@ to them , be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as the Lord hat@@ h said of the sons of David .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , of the pri@@ ests and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be por@@ ters of the doors ;
and a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
but let none come into the house of the Lord , save the pri@@ ests , and they that minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes ; they shall go in , for they are hol@@ y : but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall comp@@ ass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever else co@@ me@@ th into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he co@@ me@@ th in , and when he go@@ eth out .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes and all Ju@@ da@@ h did according to all things that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est had comman@@ ded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , with them that were to go out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath : for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est dismissed not the courses .
moreover Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temp@@ le to the left side of the temp@@ le , along by the alt@@ ar and the temp@@ le , by the king round about .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the hor@@ se gate by the king 's house , they sle@@ w her there .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the Lord 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down , and br@@ ake his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
and he took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , and the no@@ bles , and the govern@@ ors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
and all the people of the land re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed : and the city was quiet , after that they had sla@@ in Ath@@ ali@@ ah with the s@@ word .
Jo@@ ash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned for@@ ty years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was Zi@@ bi@@ ah of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
for the sons of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , that w@@ ic@@ ked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bes@@ to@@ w upon Ba@@ al@@ im .
and at the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment they made a ch@@ est , and set it without at the gate of the house of the Lord .
and they made a proc@@ lamation through Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , to bring in to the Lord the collection that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of God laid upon Israel in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and all the pr@@ inces and all the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and brought in , and cast into the ch@@ est , until they had made an end .
and the king and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as w@@ rought iron and br@@ ass to mend the house of the Lord .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada wa@@ xed old , and was full of days when he died ; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
now after the death of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada came the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to the king . then the king hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to them .
yet he sent pro@@ ph@@ ets to them , to bring them again un@@ to the Lord ; and they testified against them : but they would not give e@@ ar .
and they consp@@ ired against him , and st@@ oned him with stones at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord .
thus Jo@@ ash the king remember@@ ed not the kin@@ d@@ ness which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada his father had done to him , but sle@@ w his son . and when he died , he said , The Lord look upon it , and require it .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and destroyed all the pr@@ inces of the people from among the people , and sent all the sp@@ oil of them un@@ to the king of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan of Jer@@ usalem .
now it came to pass , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he sle@@ w his servants that had killed the king his father .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with the@@ e ; for the Lord is not with Israel , to w@@ it , with all the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t go , do it , be strong for the battle : God shall make the@@ e fall before the enemy : for God hat@@ h power to help , and to cast down .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , to w@@ it , the army that was come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : where@@ fore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in great an@@ ger .
and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the val@@ ley of salt , and smo@@ te of the chi@@ d@@ ren of Se@@ ir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away cap@@ tive , and brought them un@@ to the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
now it came to pass , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se un@@ to them .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , and he sent un@@ to him a pro@@ phe@@ t , which said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y h@@ ast th@@ ou sought after the go@@ ds of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of th@@ ine hand ?
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h took advice , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the son of J@@ eh@@ u , king of Israel , saying , C@@ ome , let us see one another in the face .
T@@ ho@@ u say@@ est , L@@ o , th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ mit@@ ten the E@@ dom@@ ites ; and th@@ ine heart lif@@ te@@ th the@@ e up to bo@@ ast : abide now at home ; why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou med@@ dle to th@@ ine hurt , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest fall , even th@@ ou , and Ju@@ da@@ h with the@@ e ?
so Jo@@ ash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the host@@ ages also , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , first and last , be@@ hold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel ?
now after the time that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah did turn away from following the Lord they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem ; and he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish : but they sent to L@@ ach@@ ish after him , and sle@@ w him there .
then all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took Uz@@ zi@@ ah , who was six@@ teen years old , and made him king in the room of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
six@@ teen years old was Uz@@ zi@@ ah when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty and two years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was J@@ ec@@ ol@@ i@@ ah of Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah did .
and he sought God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosp@@ er .
and he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and br@@ ake down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d , and built cities about Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the Am@@ mon@@ ites gave gifts to Uz@@ zi@@ ah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah built tow@@ ers in Jer@@ usalem at the cor@@ ner gate , and at the val@@ ley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and for@@ ti@@ fied them .
the whole number of the chief of the fa@@ thers of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our were two thousand and six hundred .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with m@@ igh@@ ty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah prepared for them throughout all the host shi@@ elds , and spe@@ ars , and hel@@ me@@ ts , and haber@@ ge@@ ons , and bo@@ ws , and s@@ lings to cast stones .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temp@@ le of the Lord to bur@@ n incen@@ se upon the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est went in after him , and with him fo@@ ur@@ score pri@@ ests of the Lord , that were val@@ i@@ ant men :
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per un@@ to the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the field of the bur@@ ial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a le@@ per : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Jo@@ th@@ am was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was Jer@@ us@@ ha@@ h , the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah did : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it he entered not into the temp@@ le of the Lord . and the people did yet cor@@ rup@@ tly .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and Z@@ ic@@ hri , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , sle@@ w Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the king 's son , and Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am the governor of the house , and El@@ kan@@ ah that was next to the king .
and the children of Israel carried away cap@@ tive of their bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and took also away much sp@@ oil from them , and brought the sp@@ oil to Samar@@ ia .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for bon@@ d@@ men and bon@@ d@@ women un@@ to you : but are there not with you , even with you , sin@@ s against the Lord your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the cap@@ tives again , which ye have taken cap@@ tive of your bre@@ th@@ ren : for the fierce wr@@ ath of the Lord is upon you .
then certain of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , and Je@@ hiz@@ ki@@ ah the son of S@@ hal@@ lum , and A@@ masa the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against them that came from the war ,
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it un@@ to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but he helped him not .
and A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him al@@ tar@@ s in every cor@@ ner of Jer@@ usalem .
and in every several city of Ju@@ da@@ h he made high places to bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and provoked to an@@ ger the Lord God of his fa@@ thers .
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem : but they brought him not into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he re@@ ig@@ ned nine and twenty years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and rep@@ aired them .
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the por@@ ch , and put out the lam@@ ps , and have not burned incen@@ se nor offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings in the hol@@ y place un@@ to the God of Israel .
then the L@@ evi@@ tes ar@@ ose , Mah@@ ath the son of A@@ mas@@ ai , and Jo@@ el the son of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : and of the sons of Mer@@ ari , K@@ ish the son of Ab@@ di , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hal@@ ele@@ l : and of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites ; Jo@@ ah the son of Z@@ im@@ ma@@ h , and E@@ den the son of Jo@@ ah :
and they gathered their bre@@ th@@ ren , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and came , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the king , by the words of the Lord , to cleans@@ e the house of the Lord .
and the pri@@ ests went into the in@@ ner part of the house of the Lord , to cleans@@ e it , and brought out all the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that they found in the temp@@ le of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . and the L@@ evi@@ tes took it , to carry it out abroad into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanc@@ ti@@ fy , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the por@@ ch of the Lord : so they sanc@@ ti@@ fied the house of the Lord in eight days ; and in the six@@ teen@@ th day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king , and said , We have cleans@@ ed all the house of the Lord , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , with all the vessels there@@ of , and the she@@ w@@ bread table , with all the vessels there@@ of .
moreover all the vessels , which king A@@ haz in his reign did cast away in his trans@@ gres@@ sion , have we prepared and sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and , be@@ hold , they are before the alt@@ ar of the Lord .
so they killed the bul@@ loc@@ ks , and the pri@@ ests received the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the alt@@ ar : likewise , when they had killed the r@@ ams , they sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar : they killed also the lam@@ bs , and they sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded to offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering upon the alt@@ ar . and when the bur@@ n@@ t offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with the instruments or@@ da@@ ined by David king of Israel .
and when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him bo@@ wed themselves , and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
moreover H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king and the pr@@ inces comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes to sing praise un@@ to the Lord with the words of David , and of A@@ sap@@ h the se@@ er . and they san@@ g pra@@ ises with gla@@ d@@ ness , and they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and the number of the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , which the Con@@ gre@@ gation brought , was thre@@ es@@ core and ten bul@@ loc@@ ks , an hundred r@@ ams , and two hundred lam@@ bs : all these were for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to the Lord .
and also the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings were in ab@@ und@@ ance , with the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , and the drink offer@@ ings for every bur@@ n@@ t offering . so the service of the house of the Lord was set in order .
for the king had taken coun@@ sel , and his pr@@ inces , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation in Jer@@ usalem , to keep the pass@@ over in the second month .
and be not ye like your fa@@ thers , and like your bre@@ th@@ ren , which t@@ res@@ passed against the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , who therefore gave them up to de@@ so@@ lation , as ye see .
now be ye not sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked , as your fa@@ thers were , but yield yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the Lord , and enter into his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which he hat@@ h sanc@@ ti@@ fied for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath may turn away from you .
and they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they killed the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month : and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were as@@ ha@@ med , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and brought in the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings into the house of the Lord .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Mos@@ es the man of God : the pri@@ ests sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood , which they received of the hand of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
for there were many in the Con@@ gre@@ gation that were not sanc@@ ti@@ fied : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes had the charge of the killing of the pass@@ overs for every one that was not clean , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them un@@ to the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jer@@ usalem kept the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days with great gla@@ d@@ ness : and the L@@ evi@@ tes and the pri@@ ests praised the Lord day by day , singing with l@@ oud instruments un@@ to the Lord .
for H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h did give to the Con@@ gre@@ gation a thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven thousand she@@ ep ; and the pr@@ inces gave to the Con@@ gre@@ gation a thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks and ten thousand she@@ ep : and a great number of pri@@ ests sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation that came out of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ gers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his sub@@ stance for the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , to w@@ it , for the morning and evening bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings for the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and for the new mo@@ ons , and for the set fe@@ asts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
moreover he comman@@ ded the people that d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem to give the portion of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord .
and concerning the children of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , they also brought in the ti@@ the of ox@@ en and she@@ ep , and the ti@@ the of hol@@ y things which were consec@@ rated un@@ to the Lord their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the he@@ aps , and finished them in the seventh month .
after these things , and the establishment there@@ of , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came , and entered into Ju@@ da@@ h , and en@@ camp@@ ed against the f@@ enced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah saw that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b was come , and that he was pur@@ posed to fight against Jer@@ usalem ,
he took coun@@ sel with his pr@@ inces and his m@@ igh@@ ty men to stop the waters of the fo@@ un@@ tains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and sp@@ ake comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
be strong and cour@@ age@@ ous , be not afraid nor dis@@ may@@ ed for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , nor for all the multi@@ tude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
with him is an arm of f@@ les@@ h ; but with us is the Lord our God to help us , and to fight our batt@@ les . and the people rested themselves upon the words of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
after this did Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a send his servants to Jer@@ usalem , ( but he himself laid siege against L@@ ach@@ ish , and all his power with him , ) un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and un@@ to all Ju@@ da@@ h that were at Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
Do@@ th not H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you to give over yo@@ ur@@ selves to die by fam@@ ine and by thir@@ st , saying , The Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
know ye not what I and my fa@@ thers have done un@@ to all the people of other lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations that my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' speech un@@ to the people of Jer@@ usalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and they sp@@ ake against the God of Jer@@ usalem , as against the go@@ ds of the people of the ear@@ th , which were the work of the hands of man .
thus the Lord sav@@ ed H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and from the hand of all other , and gui@@ ded them on every side .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had exceeding much ri@@ ches and honour : and he made himself treas@@ ur@@ ies for silver , and for gold , and for pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and for sp@@ ices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all manner of pleas@@ ant je@@ wel@@ s ;
this same H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah also stopped the up@@ per water@@ course of G@@ ih@@ on , and brought it stra@@ ight down to the west side of the city of David . and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah prosp@@ ered in all his works .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it in the business of the ambassadors of the pr@@ inces of Bab@@ yl@@ on , who sent un@@ to him to inqu@@ ire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his Go@@ od@@ ness , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , and in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the chi@@ ef@@ est of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the sons of David : and all Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem did him honour at his death . and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
but did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , like un@@ to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had broken down , and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for Ba@@ al@@ im , and made gro@@ ves , and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served them .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m : also he observed times , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and used wit@@ ch@@ craft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he w@@ rought much ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord brought upon them the cap@@ tains of the host of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , which took Man@@ as@@ se@@ h among the thor@@ ns , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and pray@@ ed un@@ to him : and he was in@@ treated of him , and heard his supp@@ lic@@ ation , and brought him again to Jer@@ usalem into his k@@ ing@@ dom . then Man@@ as@@ se@@ h knew that the Lord he was God .
and he took away the st@@ range go@@ ds , and the i@@ dol out of the house of the Lord , and all the al@@ tar@@ s that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jer@@ usalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and his pray@@ er un@@ to his God , and the words of the se@@ ers that sp@@ ake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
but he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father : for Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to all the car@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them ;
but the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and so did he in the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Simeon , even un@@ to Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , with their mat@@ to@@ cks round about .
and when he had broken down the al@@ tar@@ s and the gro@@ ves , and had beaten the Gra@@ ven images into pow@@ der , and cut down all the id@@ ols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jer@@ usalem .
now in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of his reign , when he had p@@ urged the land , and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the rec@@ order , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the work@@ men that w@@ rought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est found a book of the law of the Lord given by Mos@@ es .
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah answ@@ ered and said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to TH@@ Y servants , they do it .
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the over@@ se@@ ers , and to the hand of the work@@ men .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and they that the king had appointed , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ vat@@ h , the son of Has@@ ra@@ h , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem in the colle@@ ge : ) and they sp@@ ake to her to that effect .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h :
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wr@@ ath shall be p@@ oured out upon this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
and as for the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , so shall ye say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
and he caused all that were present in Jer@@ usalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem did according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God , the God of their fa@@ thers .
and he set the pri@@ ests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord ,
and prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves by the houses of your fa@@ thers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the families of the fa@@ thers of your bre@@ th@@ ren the people , and after the division of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
so kill the pass@@ over , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , and prepare your bre@@ th@@ ren , that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and Jos@@ i@@ ah gave to the people , of the flock , lam@@ bs and kids , all for the pass@@ over offer@@ ings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks : these were of the king 's sub@@ stance .
so the service was prepared , and the pri@@ ests stood in their place , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , according to the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
and they removed the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer un@@ to the Lord , as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es . and so did they with the ox@@ en .
and they ro@@ asted the pass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other hol@@ y offer@@ ings so@@ d they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ edil@@ y among all the people .
so all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day , to keep the pass@@ over , and to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of king Jos@@ i@@ ah .
his servants therefore took him out of that char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had ; and they brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of his fa@@ thers . and all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
and Jerem@@ i@@ ah lamen@@ ted for Jos@@ i@@ ah : and all the singing men and the singing women sp@@ ake of Jos@@ i@@ ah in their lament@@ ations to this day , and made them an ordin@@ ance in Israel : and , be@@ hold , they are written in the lament@@ ations .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and his Go@@ od@@ ness , according to that which was written in the law of the Lord ,
and his de@@ eds , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
then the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and made him king in his father 's stead in Jer@@ usalem .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord his God .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put them in his temp@@ le at Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ omin@@ ations which he did , and that which was found in him , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months and ten days in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
and when the year was expired , king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sent , and brought him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the good@@ ly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord his God , and hum@@ b@@ led not himself before Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t speaking from the m@@ outh of the Lord .
and he also rebel@@ led against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , who had made him swe@@ ar by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his nec@@ k , and har@@ dened his heart from turning un@@ to the Lord God of Israel .
moreover all the chief of the pri@@ ests , and the people , trans@@ g@@ ressed very much after all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then ; and pollu@@ ted the house of the Lord which he had hal@@ low@@ ed in Jer@@ usalem .
and the Lord God of their fa@@ thers sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up be@@ times , and sending ; because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
but they mo@@ cked the mes@@ sen@@ gers of God , and desp@@ ised his words , and mis@@ used his pro@@ ph@@ ets , until the wr@@ ath of the Lord ar@@ ose against his people , ti@@ ll there was no re@@ medy .
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces ; all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the house of God , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem , and bur@@ n@@ t all the pal@@ aces there@@ of with fire , and destroyed all the good@@ ly vessels there@@ of .
and them that had escaped from the s@@ word carried he away to Bab@@ yl@@ on ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia :
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of the Lord by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be fulfilled , the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , The Lord God of heav@@ en hat@@ h given me all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th ; and he hat@@ h charged me to build him an house at Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h .
who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel , ( he is the God , ) which is in Jer@@ usalem .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with be@@ asts , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , bes@@ ide all that was will@@ ingly offered .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar bring up with them of the cap@@ tivity that were brought up from Bab@@ yl@@ on un@@ to Jer@@ usalem .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and came again un@@ to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
the children of Pah@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ a@@ b , of the children of J@@ es@@ hua and Jo@@ a@@ b , two thousand eight hundred and twelve .
the pri@@ ests : the children of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , of the house of J@@ es@@ hua , nine hundred sev@@ enty and three .
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of Sop@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ uda ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth of Z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of A@@ mi .
and these were they which went up from Tel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ lah , Tel @@@ -@@ @ har@@ sa , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ dan , and Im@@ mer : but they could not she@@ w their father 's house , and their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred fif@@ ty and two .
and of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i ; which took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name :
these sought their register among those that were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy , but they were not found : therefore were they , as pollu@@ ted , put from the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
and the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a said un@@ to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , ti@@ ll there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and with Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jer@@ usalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and some of the people , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jer@@ usalem .
and they set the alt@@ ar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on un@@ to the Lord , even bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings morning and evening .
they kept also the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les , as it is written , and offered the daily bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings by number , according to the cust@@ om , as the duty of every day required ;
and after@@ ward offered the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , both of the new mo@@ ons , and of all the set fe@@ asts of the Lord that were consec@@ rated , and of every one that will@@ ingly offered a fre@@ e@@ will offering un@@ to the Lord .
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord . but the foundation of the temp@@ le of the Lord was not yet laid .
then stood J@@ es@@ hua with his sons and his bre@@ th@@ ren , Kad@@ mi@@ el and his sons , the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h , together , to set forward the work@@ men in the house of God : the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , with their sons and their bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes .
but many of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes and chief of the fa@@ thers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice ; and many sh@@ ou@@ ted al@@ oud for joy :
so that the people could not dis@@ cer@@ n the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out of joy from the no@@ ise of the we@@ eping of the people : for the people sh@@ ou@@ ted with a l@@ oud sh@@ out , and the no@@ ise was heard af@@ ar off .
and hired coun@@ sel@@ lers against them , to fru@@ str@@ ate their purpose , all the days of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , even until the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us king of Per@@ sia .
and in the reign of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they un@@ to him an accus@@ ation against the inhabitants of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
and in the days of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es wrote B@@ ish@@ lam , Mi@@ th@@ red@@ ath , T@@ ab@@ e@@ el , and the rest of their compan@@ ions , un@@ to Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Per@@ sia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian ton@@ gue , and interpreted in the Syrian ton@@ gue .
then wrote Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and the rest of their compan@@ ions ; the Din@@ ai@@ tes , the Ap@@ har@@ sa@@ th@@ chi@@ tes , the Tar@@ p@@ eli@@ tes , the Ap@@ har@@ sites , the Arch@@ evi@@ tes , the Bab@@ y@@ lon@@ ians , the Sus@@ an@@ chi@@ tes , the De@@ ha@@ vi@@ tes , and the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and no@@ ble As@@ n@@ app@@ ar brought over , and set in the cities of Samar@@ ia , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
this is the cop@@ y of the letter that they sent un@@ to him , even un@@ to Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king ; Th@@ y servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known now un@@ to the king , that , if this city be buil@@ ded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tri@@ bute , and cust@@ om , and so th@@ ou s@@ halt end@@ am@@ age the revenue of the kings .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dis@@ honour , therefore have we sent and certi@@ fied the king ;
then sent the king an answer un@@ to Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and to Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and to the rest of their compan@@ ions that d@@ well in Samar@@ ia , and un@@ to the rest beyond the river , Peace , and at such a time .
and I comman@@ ded , and search hat@@ h been made , and it is found that this city of old time hat@@ h made insur@@ rec@@ tion against kings , and that rebel@@ lion and se@@ di@@ tion have been made there@@ in .
there have been m@@ igh@@ ty kings also over Jer@@ usalem , which have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tri@@ bute , and cust@@ om , was paid un@@ to them .
now when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went up in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
then the pro@@ ph@@ ets , Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of I@@ d@@ do , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied un@@ to the Jews that were in Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in the name of the God of Israel , even un@@ to them .
then rose up Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jer@@ usalem : and with them were the pro@@ ph@@ ets of God helping them .
then said we un@@ to them after this manner , What are the names of the men that make this building ?
but the eye of their God was upon the el@@ ders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to ce@@ ase , ti@@ ll the matter came to Dar@@ i@@ us : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the cop@@ y of the letter that Tat@@ na@@ i , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ boz@@ na@@ i , and his compan@@ ions the Ap@@ har@@ s@@ achi@@ tes , which were on this side the river , sent un@@ to Dar@@ i@@ us the king :
we asked their names also , to certi@@ fy the@@ e , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
but after that our fa@@ thers had provoked the God of heav@@ en un@@ to wr@@ ath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , the Chal@@ de@@ an , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar took out of the temp@@ le that was in Jer@@ usalem , and brought them into the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , those did Cy@@ ru@@ s the king take out of the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and they were delivered un@@ to one , whose name was Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , whom he had made governor ;
and said un@@ to him , T@@ ake these vessels , go , carry them into the temp@@ le that is in Jer@@ usalem , and let the house of God be buil@@ ded in his place .
then came the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now hat@@ h it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
then Dar@@ i@@ us the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rol@@ ls , where the treasures were laid up in Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and there was found at A@@ ch@@ meth@@ a , in the palace that is in the province of the Me@@ des , a rol@@ l , and there@@ in was a record thus written :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the el@@ ders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
then Tat@@ na@@ i , governor on this side the river , She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ boz@@ na@@ i , and their compan@@ ions , according to that which Dar@@ i@@ us the king had sent , so they did spe@@ edil@@ y .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month Ad@@ ar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the king .
and the children of Israel , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the rest of the children of the cap@@ tivity , kept the dedic@@ ation of this house of God with joy ,
and offered at the dedic@@ ation of this house of God an hundred bul@@ loc@@ ks , two hundred r@@ ams , four hundred lam@@ bs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he go@@ ats , according to the number of the tri@@ bes of Israel .
and they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
for the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were pur@@ ified together , all of them were p@@ ure , and killed the pass@@ over for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , and for themselves .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves un@@ to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the he@@ a@@ then of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
for E@@ z@@ ra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord , and to do it , and to te@@ ach in Israel stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments .
now this is the cop@@ y of the letter that the king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es gave un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be , even a s@@ cri@@ be of the words of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and of his stat@@ utes to Israel .
Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es , king of kings , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , a s@@ cri@@ be of the law of the God of heav@@ en , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , which are min@@ ded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jer@@ usalem , go with the@@ e .
For@@ as@@ much as th@@ ou art sent of the king , and of his seven coun@@ sel@@ lers , to inqu@@ ire concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , according to the law of TH@@ Y God which is in th@@ ine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his coun@@ sel@@ lers have freely offered un@@ to the God of Israel , whose habi@@ tation is in Jer@@ usalem ,
and all the silver and gold that th@@ ou can@@ st find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem :
that th@@ ou may@@ est buy spe@@ edil@@ y with this money bul@@ loc@@ ks , r@@ ams , lam@@ bs , with their meat offer@@ ings and their drink offer@@ ings , and offer them upon the alt@@ ar of the house of your God which is in Jer@@ usalem .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall seem good to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
the vessels also that are given the@@ e for the service of the house of TH@@ Y God , those deliver th@@ ou before the God of Jer@@ usalem .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever more shall be ne@@ ed@@ ful for the house of TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have occasion to bes@@ to@@ w , bes@@ to@@ w it out of the king 's treasure house .
un@@ to an hundred tal@@ ents of silver , and to an hundred measures of wheat , and to an hundred ba@@ ths of wine , and to an hundred ba@@ ths of oil , and salt without pres@@ cri@@ bing how much .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be dil@@ ig@@ ently done for the house of the God of heav@@ en : for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
also we certi@@ fy you , that tou@@ ching any of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , singers , por@@ ters , N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be law@@ ful to impose toll , tri@@ bute , or cust@@ om , upon them .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not do the law of TH@@ Y God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed spe@@ edil@@ y upon him , whether it be un@@ to death , or to ban@@ is@@ hment , or to confis@@ cation of goods , or to imprisonment .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of our fa@@ thers , which hat@@ h put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to be@@ auti@@ fy the house of the Lord which is in Jer@@ usalem :
these are now the chief of their fa@@ thers , and this is the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of them that went up with me from Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
of the sons of Ph@@ ine@@ has ; Ger@@ sho@@ m : of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; Daniel : of the sons of David ; H@@ att@@ ush .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of P@@ har@@ os@@ h ; Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah : and with him were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of the mal@@ es an hundred and fif@@ ty .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah ; the son of Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el , and with him three hundred mal@@ es .
and of the sons of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith ; the son of Josip@@ hi@@ ah , and with him an hundred and thre@@ es@@ core mal@@ es .
and of the sons of B@@ eb@@ ai ; Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of B@@ eb@@ ai , and with him twenty and eight mal@@ es .
and of the sons of Az@@ g@@ ad ; Johan@@ an the son of Hak@@ kat@@ an , and with him an hundred and ten mal@@ es .
and I gathered them together to the river that run@@ net@@ h to A@@ hava ; and there abo@@ de we in ten@@ ts three days : and I viewed the people , and the pri@@ ests , and found there none of the sons of L@@ evi .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Jar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and for Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , men of understanding .
also of the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , whom David and the pr@@ inces had appointed for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , two hundred and twenty N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims : all of them were expressed by name .
and weighed un@@ to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his coun@@ sel@@ lers , and his lor@@ ds , and all Israel there present , had offered :
I even weighed un@@ to their hand six hundred and fif@@ ty tal@@ ents of silver , and silver vessels an hundred tal@@ ents , and of gold an hundred tal@@ ents ;
watch ye , and keep them , until ye we@@ igh them before the chief of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the ch@@ ambers of the house of the Lord .
so took the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the house of our God .
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have min@@ g@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers hat@@ h been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down ast@@ on@@ ied .
then were assemb@@ led un@@ to me every one that tre@@ m@@ b@@ led at the words of the God of Israel , because of the trans@@ gres@@ sion of those that had been carried away ; and I sat ast@@ on@@ ied until the evening sacrifice .
and at the evening sacrifice I ar@@ ose up from my heav@@ iness ; and having rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , I fell upon my k@@ ne@@ es , and spread out my hands un@@ to the Lord my God .
and said , O my God , I am as@@ ha@@ med and b@@ lus@@ h to lift up my face to the@@ e , my God : for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities are increased over our head , and our t@@ res@@ pass is grown up un@@ to the heav@@ ens .
and Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of E@@ lam , answ@@ ered and said un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra , We have t@@ res@@ passed against our God , and have taken st@@ range wi@@ ves of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
and they made proc@@ lamation throughout Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem un@@ to all the children of the cap@@ tivity , that they should gather themselves together un@@ to Jer@@ usalem ;
and that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever would not come within three days , according to the coun@@ sel of the pr@@ inces and the el@@ ders , all his sub@@ stance should be for@@ fe@@ ited , and himself separated from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of those that had been carried away .
now therefore make conf@@ ession un@@ to the Lord God of your fa@@ thers , and do his pleas@@ ure : and separate yo@@ ur@@ selves from the people of the land , and from the st@@ range wi@@ ves .
and among the sons of the pri@@ ests there were found that had taken st@@ range wi@@ ves : name@@ ly , of the sons of J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and his bre@@ th@@ ren ; Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Jar@@ i@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wi@@ ves ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their t@@ res@@ pass .
also of the L@@ evi@@ tes ; Joz@@ ab@@ ad , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Ke@@ la@@ i@@ ah , ( the same is Kel@@ ita , ) P@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , Ju@@ da@@ h , and Eli@@ ez@@ er .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Par@@ os@@ h ; Ram@@ i@@ ah , and J@@ ez@@ i@@ ah , and Mal@@ chi@@ ah , and Mi@@ amin , and Ele@@ azar , and Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah .
the words of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Hac@@ hali@@ ah . and it came to pass in the month Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year , as I was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
that Han@@ ani , one of my bre@@ th@@ ren , came , he and certain men of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
and they said un@@ to me , The re@@ mn@@ ant that are left of the cap@@ tivity there in the province are in great aff@@ li@@ ction and re@@ pro@@ ach : the wall of Jer@@ usalem also is broken down , and the gates there@@ of are burned with fire .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days , and fas@@ ted , and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
and said , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , O Lord God of heav@@ en , the great and ter@@ ri@@ ble God , that keep@@ eth C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and mer@@ cy for them that love him and observe his comman@@ d@@ ments :
we have dealt very cor@@ rup@@ tly against the@@ e , and have not kept the comman@@ d@@ ments , nor the stat@@ utes , nor the judg@@ ments , which th@@ ou comman@@ de@@ d@@ st TH@@ Y ser@@ vant Mos@@ es .
but if ye turn un@@ to me , and keep my comman@@ d@@ ments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the heav@@ en , yet will I gather them from th@@ ence , and will bring them un@@ to the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
and it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine , and gave it un@@ to the king . now I had not been be@@ fore@@ time sad in his presence .
and said un@@ to the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my coun@@ tenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fa@@ thers ' se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , li@@ eth waste , and the gates there@@ of are consu@@ med with fire ?
moreover I said un@@ to the king , If it ple@@ ase the king , let letters be given me to the govern@@ ors beyond the river , that they may conv@@ ey me over ti@@ ll I come into Ju@@ da@@ h ;
then I came to the govern@@ ors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent cap@@ tains of the army and hor@@ se@@ men with me .
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and I ar@@ ose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jer@@ usalem : neither was there any be@@ ast with me , save the be@@ ast that I ro@@ de upon .
then I went on to the gate of the fo@@ un@@ tain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the be@@ ast that was under me to pass .
then went I up in the night by the Bro@@ ok , and viewed the wall , and turned back , and entered by the gate of the val@@ ley , and so returned .
and the rul@@ ers knew not w@@ hi@@ ther I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the pri@@ ests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rul@@ ers , nor to the rest that did the work .
but when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , and G@@ es@@ hem the Ara@@ bi@@ an , heard it , they la@@ ug@@ hed us to scor@@ n , and desp@@ ised us , and said , What is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est rose up with his bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , and they buil@@ ded the she@@ ep gate ; they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and set up the doors of it ; even un@@ to the to@@ wer of Me@@ ah they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , un@@ to the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el .
but the fish gate did the sons of H@@ ass@@ en@@ a@@ ah build , who also laid the be@@ ams there@@ of , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah , the son of Ko@@ z . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ e@@ el . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana .
moreover the old gate rep@@ aired Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah ; they laid the be@@ ams there@@ of , and set up the doors there@@ of , and the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Me@@ la@@ ti@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , and Jad@@ on the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite , the men of Gi@@ be@@ on , and of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , un@@ to the th@@ r@@ one of the governor on this side the river .
next un@@ to him rep@@ aired Uz@@ zi@@ el the son of Har@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , of the gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths . next un@@ to him also rep@@ aired Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of one of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ aries , and they for@@ ti@@ fied Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the broad wall .
and next un@@ to him rep@@ aired S@@ hal@@ lum the son of H@@ alo@@ hes@@ h , the ru@@ ler of the half part of Jer@@ usalem , he and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
the val@@ ley gate rep@@ aired Han@@ un , and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah ; they built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of , and a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts on the wall un@@ to the D@@ ung gate .
but the D@@ ung gate rep@@ aired Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of part of Beth @@@ -@@ @ h@@ acc@@ er@@ em ; he built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
after him rep@@ aired Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ bu@@ k , the ru@@ ler of the half part of Beth @@@ -@@ @ z@@ ur , un@@ to the place over against the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of David , and to the pool that was made , and un@@ to the house of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
and next to him rep@@ aired E@@ zer the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the ru@@ ler of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , another piece over against the going up to the ar@@ mo@@ ury at the turning of the wall .
after him rep@@ aired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the son of Ko@@ z another piece , from the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b even to the end of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat heard that we buil@@ ded the wall , he was wro@@ th , and took great in@@ dign@@ ation , and mo@@ cked the Jews .
and cover not their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and let not their sin be blo@@ t@@ ted out from before the@@ e : for they have provoked the@@ e to an@@ ger before the buil@@ ders .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat , and To@@ bi@@ ah , and the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , and the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ di@@ tes , heard that the walls of Jer@@ usalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wro@@ th ,
and it came to pass , that when the Jews which d@@ wel@@ t by them came , they said un@@ to us ten times , From all places wh@@ ence ye shall return un@@ to us they will be upon you .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their s@@ words , their spe@@ ars , and their bo@@ ws .
and it came to pass , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known un@@ to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one un@@ to his work .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants w@@ rought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spe@@ ars , the shi@@ elds , and the bo@@ ws , and the haber@@ ge@@ ons ; and the rul@@ ers were behind all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
they which buil@@ ded on the wall , and they that b@@ are bur@@ den@@ s , with those that la@@ ded , every one with one of his hands w@@ rought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the buil@@ ders , every one had his s@@ word gir@@ ded by his side , and so buil@@ ded . and he that so@@ unded the tr@@ ump@@ et was by me .
so we la@@ b@@ oured in the work : and half of them held the spe@@ ars from the rising of the morning ti@@ ll the stars appeared .
so neither I , nor my bre@@ th@@ ren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clo@@ th@@ es , saving that every one put them off for w@@ ashing .
I likewise , and my bre@@ th@@ ren , and my servants , might exact of them money and cor@@ n : I pra@@ y you , let us leave off this us@@ ury .
Ye@@ a , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered th@@ ither un@@ to the work .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fif@@ ty of the Jews and rul@@ ers , bes@@ ide those that came un@@ to us from among the he@@ a@@ then that are about us .
that San@@ bal@@ lat and G@@ es@@ hem sent un@@ to me , saying , C@@ ome , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the pla@@ in of O@@ no . but they thought to do me mis@@ chief .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast also appointed pro@@ ph@@ ets to pre@@ ach of the@@ e at Jer@@ usalem , saying , There is a king in Ju@@ da@@ h : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take coun@@ sel together .
and I said , Sho@@ uld such a man as I flee ? and who is there , that , being as I am , would go into the temp@@ le to save his life ? I will not go in .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an ev@@ il report , that they might re@@ pro@@ ach me .
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month E@@ lu@@ l , in fif@@ ty and two days .
moreover in those days the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h sent many letters un@@ to To@@ bi@@ ah , and the letters of To@@ bi@@ ah came un@@ to them .
for there were many in Ju@@ da@@ h sworn un@@ to him , because he was the son in law of Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Johan@@ an had taken the daughter of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the por@@ ters and the singers and the L@@ evi@@ tes were appointed ,
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and came again to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
who came with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , J@@ es@@ hua , Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , Ra@@ am@@ i@@ ah , N@@ ah@@ am@@ ani , Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Bil@@ sh@@ an , Mis@@ per@@ eth , B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai , Ne@@ h@@ um , Ba@@ an@@ ah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
the children of Pah@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ a@@ b , of the children of J@@ es@@ hua and Jo@@ a@@ b , two thousand and eight hundred and E@@ igh@@ teen .
the pri@@ ests : the children of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , of the house of J@@ es@@ hua , nine hundred sev@@ enty and three .
the L@@ evi@@ tes : the children of J@@ es@@ hua , of Kad@@ mi@@ el , and of the children of Ho@@ dev@@ ah , sev@@ enty and four .
the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , an hundred thirty and eight .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of Sop@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ ida ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth of Z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of Am@@ on .
and these were they which went up also from Tel@@ me@@ lah , Tel@@ har@@ es@@ ha , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ don , and Im@@ mer : but they could not she@@ w their father 's house , nor their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel .
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred for@@ ty and two .
and of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , which took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te to wife , and was called after their name .
these sought their register among those that were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy , but it was not found : therefore were they , as pollu@@ ted , put from the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
and the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a said un@@ to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , ti@@ ll there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers gave un@@ to the work . the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a gave to the treasure a thousand dr@@ ams of gold , fif@@ ty bas@@ ons , five hundred and thirty pri@@ ests ' gar@@ ments .
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand dr@@ ams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred po@@ und of silver .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the por@@ ters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , and all Israel , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their cities .
and E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est brought the law before the Con@@ gre@@ gation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and E@@ z@@ ra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
also J@@ es@@ hua , and Ban@@ i , and S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , J@@ amin , Ak@@ ku@@ b , Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai , Ho@@ dij@@ ah , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , Kel@@ ita , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , Joz@@ ab@@ ad , H@@ anan , Pe@@ la@@ i@@ ah , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stood in their place .
so they read in the book in the law of God distinc@@ tly , and gave the sense , and caused them to understand the reading .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send por@@ tions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared un@@ to them .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fa@@ thers of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to understand the words of the law .
and they found written in the law which the Lord had comman@@ ded by Mos@@ es , that the children of Israel should d@@ well in bo@@ o@@ ths in the feast of the seventh month :
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves bo@@ o@@ ths , every one upon the ro@@ of of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of them that were come again out of the cap@@ tivity made bo@@ o@@ ths , and sat under the bo@@ o@@ ths : for since the days of J@@ es@@ hua the son of nun un@@ to that day had not the children of Israel done so . and there was very great gla@@ d@@ ness .
also day by day , from the first day un@@ to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . and they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a so@@ lem@@ n assembly , according un@@ to the manner .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they conf@@ essed , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord their God .
and she@@ w@@ ed@@ st signs and won@@ ders upon P@@ har@@ o@@ ah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for th@@ ou k@@ newest that they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly against them . so di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou get the@@ e a name , as it is this day .
and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st divide the sea before them , so that they went through the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry land ; and their persec@@ ut@@ ors th@@ ou thre@@ west into the deep@@ s , as a stone into the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
moreover th@@ ou led@@ dest them in the day by a cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar ; and in the night by a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light in the way where@@ in they should go .
and ma@@ dest known un@@ to them TH@@ Y hol@@ y sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and comman@@ de@@ d@@ st them prec@@ ep@@ ts , stat@@ utes , and laws , by the hand of Mos@@ es TH@@ Y ser@@ vant :
and g@@ av@@ est them bread from heav@@ en for their hunger , and b@@ rough@@ test forth water for them out of the rock for their thir@@ st , and promis@@ ed@@ st them that they should go in to poss@@ ess the land which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st sworn to give them .
Ye@@ a , when they had made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , This is TH@@ Y God that brought the@@ e up out of Egypt , and had w@@ rought great provoc@@ ations ;
yet th@@ ou in TH@@ Y manif@@ old mer@@ cies for@@ so@@ ok@@ est them not in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud depar@@ ted not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pil@@ lar of fire by night , to she@@ w them light , and the way where@@ in they should go .
Ye@@ a , for@@ ty years di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou sustain them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , so that they la@@ cked nothing ; their clo@@ th@@ es wa@@ xed not old , and their feet s@@ wel@@ led not .
moreover th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms and nations , and di@@ d@@ st divide them into cor@@ ners : so they poss@@ essed the land of S@@ ih@@ on , and the land of the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an .
their children also multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou as the stars of heav@@ en , and b@@ rough@@ test them into the land , concerning which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st promised to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
nevertheless they were dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent , and rebel@@ led against the@@ e , and cast TH@@ Y law behind their backs , and sle@@ w TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets which testified against them to turn them to the@@ e , and they w@@ rought great provoc@@ ations .
yet many years di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou for@@ bear them , and testi@@ fi@@ ed@@ st against them by TH@@ Y spirit in TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets : yet would they not give e@@ ar : therefore g@@ av@@ est th@@ ou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept TH@@ Y law , nor hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments and TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , where@@ with th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st testify against them .
for they have not served the@@ e in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in TH@@ Y great Go@@ od@@ ness that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them , and in the large and f@@ at land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est before them , neither turned they from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
be@@ hold , we are servants this day , and for the land that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers to eat the fruit there@@ of and the good there@@ of , be@@ hold , we are servants in it :
and it yi@@ el@@ de@@ th much increase un@@ to the kings whom th@@ ou h@@ ast set over us because of our sin@@ s : also they have domin@@ ion over our bodies , and over our c@@ attle , at their pleas@@ ure , and we are in great dist@@ ress .
now those that sealed were , Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah , the Tir@@ sha@@ th@@ a , the son of Hac@@ hali@@ ah , and Z@@ id@@ k@@ ij@@ ah ,
and that we would not give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to the people of the land , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for our sons :
and to bring the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of our ground , and the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of all fruit of all trees , year by year , un@@ to the house of the Lord :
also the fir@@ st@@ born of our sons , and of our c@@ attle , as it is written in the law , and the fir@@ st@@ lings of our her@@ ds and of our f@@ loc@@ ks , to bring to the house of our God , un@@ to the pri@@ ests that minister in the house of our God :
and the pri@@ est the son of Aaron shall be with the L@@ evi@@ tes , when the L@@ evi@@ tes take ti@@ th@@ es : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ th@@ es un@@ to the house of our God , to the ch@@ ambers , into the treasure house .
and the rul@@ ers of the people d@@ wel@@ t at Jer@@ usalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem the hol@@ y city , and nine parts to d@@ well in other cities .
and at Jer@@ usalem d@@ wel@@ t certain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h ; Ath@@ ai@@ ah the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ e@@ el , of the children of Per@@ ez ;

all the sons of Per@@ ez that d@@ wel@@ t at Jer@@ usalem were four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and eight val@@ i@@ ant men .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ai@@ ah .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , was the ru@@ ler of the house of God .
and their bre@@ th@@ ren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah ,
and his bre@@ th@@ ren , chief of the fa@@ thers , two hundred for@@ ty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , an hundred twenty and eight : and their over@@ se@@ er was Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el , the son of one of the great men .
also of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ash@@ u@@ b , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of Has@@ habi@@ ah , the son of Bun@@ ni ;
and Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , of the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had the over@@ sight of the ou@@ tw@@ ard business of the house of God .
and P@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ e@@ el , of the children of Zer@@ ah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h d@@ wel@@ t at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , and in the villages there@@ of , and at Di@@ bon , and in the villages there@@ of , and at J@@ ek@@ ab@@ z@@ e@@ el , and in the villages there@@ of ,
the L@@ evi@@ tes in the days of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , Jo@@ i@@ ada , and Johan@@ an , and Jad@@ du@@ a , were recorded chief of the fa@@ thers : also the pri@@ ests , to the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the Per@@ sian .
the sons of L@@ evi , the chief of the fa@@ thers , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
and the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Has@@ habi@@ ah , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Kad@@ mi@@ el , with their bre@@ th@@ ren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
these were in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and in the days of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the governor , and of E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be .
then I brought up the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , where@@ of one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the D@@ ung gate :
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets ; name@@ ly , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h :
and at the fo@@ un@@ tain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even un@@ to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and from above the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el , and the to@@ wer of Me@@ ah , even un@@ to the she@@ ep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God , and I , and the half of the rul@@ ers with me :
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ abi@@ te should not come into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Bal@@ a@@ am against them , that he should cur@@ se them : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it our God turned the cur@@ se into a b@@ les@@ sing .
and before this , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the pri@@ est , having the over@@ sight of the chamber of the house of our God , was al@@ lied un@@ to To@@ bi@@ ah :
but in all this time was not I at Jer@@ usalem : for in the two and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came I un@@ to the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
and I came to Jer@@ usalem , and understood of the ev@@ il that Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b did for To@@ bi@@ ah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
then I comman@@ ded , and they cleans@@ ed the ch@@ ambers : and th@@ ither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
and I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them : for the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wi@@ pe not out my good de@@ eds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices there@@ of .
there d@@ wel@@ t men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , which brought fish , and all manner of w@@ are , and sold on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath un@@ to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
then I testified against them , and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y lo@@ dge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and their children sp@@ ake half in the speech of Ash@@ do@@ d , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
and I conten@@ ded with them , and Cur@@ sed them , and smo@@ te certain of them , and p@@ lu@@ cked off their ha@@ ir , and made them swe@@ ar by God , saying , Y@@ e shall not give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to their sons , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to your sons , or for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
and one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est , was son in law to San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
thus cleans@@ ed I them from all st@@ ran@@ gers , and appointed the wards of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , every one in his business ;
now it came to pass in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us which re@@ ig@@ ned , from India even un@@ to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast un@@ to all his pr@@ inces and his servants ; the power of Per@@ sia and Media , the no@@ bles and pr@@ inces of the provinces , being before him :
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast un@@ to all the people that were present in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace , both un@@ to great and small , seven days , in the court of the gar@@ den of the king 's palace ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being di@@ verse one from another , ) and royal wine in ab@@ und@@ ance , according to the state of the king .
and the drinking was according to the law ; none did comp@@ el : for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleas@@ ure .
then the king said to the wise men , which knew the times , ( for so was the king 's manner toward all that knew law and judgment :
and Mem@@ uc@@ an answ@@ ered before the king and the pr@@ inces , V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een hat@@ h not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the pr@@ inces , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
for this de@@ ed of the qu@@ een shall come abroad un@@ to all women , so that they shall desp@@ ise their hus@@ bands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us comman@@ ded V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een to be brought in before him , but she came not .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his emp@@ ire , ( for it is great , ) all the wi@@ ves shall give to their hus@@ bands honour , both to great and small .
after these things , when the wr@@ ath of king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us was appe@@ ased , he remember@@ ed V@@ ash@@ ti , and what she had done , and what was decre@@ ed against her .
now in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace there was a certain J@@ ew , whose name was Mor@@ dec@@ ai , the son of J@@ air , the son of Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of K@@ ish , a Benj@@ am@@ ite ;
who had been carried away from Jer@@ usalem with the cap@@ tivity which had been carried away with J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away .
then thus came every ma@@ iden un@@ to the king ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she desi@@ red was given her to go with her out of the house of the women un@@ to the king 's house .
so Es@@ ther was taken un@@ to king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month Te@@ bet@@ h , in the seventh year of his reign .
and the king lov@@ ed Es@@ ther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the vir@@ g@@ ins ; so that he set the royal cro@@ wn upon her head , and made her qu@@ een instead of V@@ ash@@ ti .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , of those which kept the door , were wro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and the thing was known to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , who told it un@@ to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een ; and Es@@ ther certi@@ fied the king there@@ of in Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's name .
and when In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bo@@ wed , and rever@@ enced Ham@@ an : for the king had so comman@@ ded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai bo@@ wed not , nor did him rever@@ ence .
and when Ham@@ an saw that Mor@@ dec@@ ai bo@@ wed not , nor did him rever@@ ence , then was Ham@@ an full of wr@@ ath .
and he thought scor@@ n to lay hands on Mor@@ dec@@ ai alone ; for they had she@@ wed him the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai : where@@ fore Ham@@ an sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , even the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
if it ple@@ ase the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand tal@@ ents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king 's treas@@ ur@@ ies .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it un@@ to Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the Jews ' enemy .
and the king said un@@ to Ham@@ an , The silver is given to the@@ e , the people also , to do with them as it se@@ eme@@ th good to the@@ e .
the posts went out , being has@@ tened by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and the decree was given in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace . and the king and Ham@@ an sat down to drink ; but the city Sh@@ us@@ han was per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed .
when Mor@@ dec@@ ai perceived all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th with ashes , and went out into the mid@@ st of the city , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud and a bitter cry ;
and in every province , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fas@@ ting , and we@@ eping , and w@@ ailing ; and many lay in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th and ashes .
so Es@@ ther 's ma@@ ids and her ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins came and told it her . then was the qu@@ een exce@@ ed@@ ingly gri@@ ev@@ ed ; and she sent ra@@ im@@ ent to clo@@ the Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and to take away his s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th from him : but he received it not .
then called Es@@ ther for Hat@@ ach , one of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a comman@@ d@@ ment to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to know what it was , and why it was .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai told him of all that had happened un@@ to him , and of the sum of the money that Ham@@ an had promised to pay to the king 's treas@@ ur@@ ies for the Jews , to destroy them .
now it came to pass on the third day , that Es@@ ther put on her royal appar@@ el , and stood in the in@@ ner court of the king 's house , over against the king 's house : and the king sat upon his royal th@@ r@@ one in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
and it was so , when the king saw Es@@ ther the qu@@ een standing in the court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to Es@@ ther the golden scep@@ tre that was in his hand . so Es@@ ther drew near , and touched the top of the scep@@ tre .
and the king said un@@ to Es@@ ther at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , What is TH@@ Y petition ? and it shall be granted the@@ e : and what is TH@@ Y request ? even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom it shall be performed .
then went Ham@@ an forth that day jo@@ y@@ ful and with a glad heart : but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of in@@ dign@@ ation against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
and Ham@@ an told them of the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , and the multi@@ tude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sle@@ ep , and he comman@@ ded to bring the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les ; and they were read before the king .
and the king said , Wh@@ o is in the court ? now Ham@@ an was come into the ou@@ tw@@ ard court of the king 's house , to speak un@@ to the king to han@@ g Mor@@ dec@@ ai on the gal@@ lows that he had prepared for him .
and the king said again un@@ to Es@@ ther on the second day at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , What is TH@@ Y petition , qu@@ een Es@@ ther ? and it shall be granted the@@ e : and what is TH@@ Y request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered and said , If I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
on that day did the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us give the house of Ham@@ an the Jews ' enemy un@@ to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een . and Mor@@ dec@@ ai came before the king ; for Es@@ ther had told what he was un@@ to her .
and Es@@ ther sp@@ ake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him with te@@ ars to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had dev@@ ised against the Jews .
for how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the ev@@ il that shall come un@@ to my people ? or how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the destruction of my kin@@ d@@ red ?
then the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us said un@@ to Es@@ ther the qu@@ een and to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the J@@ ew , be@@ hold , I have given Es@@ ther the house of Ham@@ an , and him they have han@@ ged upon the gal@@ lows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on hor@@ se@@ back , and ri@@ ders on mu@@ les , ca@@ me@@ ls , and young dro@@ med@@ aries :
the cop@@ y of the writing for a comman@@ d@@ ment to be given in every province was published un@@ to all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to av@@ en@@ ge themselves on their enem@@ ies .
so the posts that ro@@ de upon mu@@ les and ca@@ me@@ ls went out , being has@@ tened and pressed on by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment . and the decree was given at Sh@@ us@@ han the palace .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could with@@ stand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
and all the rul@@ ers of the provinces , and the li@@ e@@ uten@@ ants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mor@@ dec@@ ai fell upon them .
for Mor@@ dec@@ ai was great in the king 's house , and his f@@ ame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man Mor@@ dec@@ ai wa@@ xed greater and greater .
thus the Jews smo@@ te all their enem@@ ies with the stro@@ ke of the s@@ word , and sla@@ ughter , and destruction , and did what they would un@@ to those that ha@@ ted them .
and Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , and Dal@@ ph@@ on , and A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
on that day the number of those that were sla@@ in in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace was brought before the king .
then said Es@@ ther , If it ple@@ ase the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Sh@@ us@@ han to do tomorrow also according un@@ to this day 's decree , and let Ham@@ an 's ten sons be han@@ ged upon the gal@@ lows .
for the Jews that were in Sh@@ us@@ han gathered themselves together on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and sle@@ w three hundred men at Sh@@ us@@ han ; but on the pre@@ y they laid not their hand .
but the other Jews that were in the king 's provinces gathered themselves together , and stood for their lives , and had rest from their enem@@ ies , and sle@@ w of their fo@@ es sev@@ enty and five thousand , but they laid not their hands on the pre@@ y ,
but the Jews that were at Sh@@ us@@ han assemb@@ led together on the thir@@ teen@@ th day there@@ of ; and on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th there@@ of ; and on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the same they rested , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gla@@ d@@ ness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , that d@@ wel@@ t in the un@@ wal@@ led towns , made the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gla@@ d@@ ness and fe@@ asting , and a good day , and of sending por@@ tions one to another .
to st@@ ab@@ lish this among them , that they should keep the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar , and the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the same , ye@@ arly ,
because Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a , the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the enemy of all the Jews , had dev@@ ised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast PUR , that is , the lot , to consum@@ e them , and to destroy them ;
but when Es@@ ther came before the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
and he sent the letters un@@ to all the Jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , with words of peace and truth ,
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the gre@@ at@@ ness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , where@@ un@@ to the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Media and Per@@ sia ?
there was a man in the land of U@@ z , whose name was Jo@@ b ; and that man was perfect and u@@ pri@@ ght , and one that fear@@ ed God , and es@@ che@@ wed ev@@ il .
his sub@@ stance also was seven thousand she@@ ep , and three thousand ca@@ me@@ ls , and five hundred yok@@ e of ox@@ en , and five hundred she ass@@ es , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
and his sons went and fe@@ asted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
and the Lord said un@@ to S@@ atan , Wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou ? then S@@ atan answ@@ ered the Lord , and said , From going to and f@@ ro in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it .
and there was a day when his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house :
and the Sab@@ e@@ ans fell upon them , and took them away ; ye@@ a , they have sla@@ in the servants with the edge of the s@@ word ; and I only am escaped alone to tell the@@ e .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Th@@ y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house :
and said , nak@@ ed came I out of my mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and nak@@ ed shall I return th@@ ither : the Lord gave , and the Lord hat@@ h taken away ; b@@ les@@ sed be the name of the Lord .
again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and S@@ atan came also among them to present himself before the Lord .
and the Lord said un@@ to S@@ atan , From wh@@ ence co@@ me@@ st th@@ ou ? and S@@ atan answ@@ ered the Lord , and said , From going to and f@@ ro in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it .
so went S@@ atan forth from the presence of the Lord , and smo@@ te Jo@@ b with sor@@ e bo@@ ils from the sole of his fo@@ ot un@@ to his cro@@ wn .
and when they lifted up their eyes af@@ ar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt ; and they rent every one his man@@ tle , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led d@@ ust upon their heads toward heav@@ en .
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven n@@ ights , and none sp@@ ake a word un@@ to him : for they saw that his gri@@ ef was very great .
as for that night , let d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize upon it ; let it not be joined un@@ to the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the tw@@ il@@ ight there@@ of be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the da@@ w@@ ning of the day :
why died I not from the w@@ om@@ b ? why did I not give up the gh@@ ost when I came out of the bel@@ ly ?
for now should I have la@@ in still and been quiet , I should have sle@@ pt : then had I been at rest ,
for the thing which I greatly fear@@ ed is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come un@@ to me .
the ro@@ aring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the te@@ eth of the young li@@ ons , are broken .
it stood still , but I could not dis@@ cer@@ n the form there@@ of : an image was before mine eyes , there was sil@@ ence , and I heard a voice , saying ,
how much less in them that d@@ well in houses of cla@@ y , whose foundation is in the d@@ ust , which are cr@@ us@@ hed before the mo@@ th ?
his children are far from safety , and they are cr@@ us@@ hed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
to set up on high those that be low ; that those which mour@@ n may be ex@@ al@@ ted to safety .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be hi@@ d from the s@@ cour@@ ge of the ton@@ gue : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou be afraid of destruction when it co@@ me@@ th .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt be in league with the stones of the field : and the be@@ asts of the field shall be at peace with the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that TH@@ Y tab@@ ern@@ acle shall be in peace ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt visit TH@@ Y habi@@ tation , and s@@ halt not sin .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt know also that TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall be great , and th@@ ine off@@ spring as the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt come to TH@@ Y grave in a full age , like as a shock of cor@@ n co@@ me@@ th in in his season .
for the ar@@ ro@@ ws of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty are within me , the po@@ ison where@@ of drin@@ ket@@ h up my spirit : the terr@@ ors of God do set themselves in array against me .
even that it would ple@@ ase God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
then should I yet have comfor@@ t ; ye@@ a , I would har@@ den myself in sor@@ row : let him not spar@@ e ; for I have not conce@@ aled the words of the Holy One .
as a ser@@ vant ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly desi@@ re@@ th the shadow , and as an hi@@ re@@ ling lo@@ ok@@ eth for the reward of his work :
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tos@@ s@@ ings to and f@@ ro un@@ to the da@@ w@@ ning of the day .
therefore I will not refrain my m@@ outh ; I will speak in the an@@ gu@@ ish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
I have sin@@ ned ; what shall I do un@@ to the@@ e , O th@@ ou preser@@ ver of men ? why h@@ ast th@@ ou set me as a mark against the@@ e , so that I am a burden to myself ?
and why dost th@@ ou not par@@ don my trans@@ gres@@ sion , and take away mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I sle@@ ep in the d@@ ust ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
wh@@ il@@ st it is yet in his green@@ ness , and not cut down , it with@@ er@@ eth before any other her@@ b .
they that h@@ ate the@@ e shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with sh@@ ame ; and the d@@ wel@@ ling place of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall come to n@@ ought .
if I justify myself , mine own m@@ outh shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me per@@ verse .
the ear@@ th is given into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked : he cover@@ eth the faces of the judges there@@ of ; if not , where , and who is he ?
my sou@@ l is we@@ ary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon myself ; I will speak in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
is it good un@@ to the@@ e that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest op@@ press , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest desp@@ ise the work of th@@ ine hands , and sh@@ ine upon the coun@@ sel of the w@@ ic@@ ked ?
if I be w@@ ic@@ ked , wo@@ e un@@ to me ; and if I be righ@@ te@@ ous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of conf@@ usion ; therefore see th@@ ou mine aff@@ li@@ ction ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore then h@@ ast th@@ ou brought me forth out of the w@@ om@@ b ? O@@ h that I had given up the gh@@ ost , and no eye had seen me !
I should have been as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the w@@ om@@ b to the grave .
a land of d@@ ark@@ ness , as d@@ ark@@ ness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as d@@ ark@@ ness .
and that he would she@@ w the@@ e the secre@@ ts of wis@@ dom , that they are double to that which is ! know therefore that God exac@@ te@@ th of the@@ e less than th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity de@@ ser@@ vet@@ h .
for then s@@ halt th@@ ou lift up TH@@ Y face without spot ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt be ste@@ d@@ fast , and s@@ halt not fear :
and th@@ ine age shall be clear@@ er than the no@@ on@@ day ; th@@ ou s@@ halt sh@@ ine forth , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as the morning .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt be secure , because there is hope ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt di@@ g about the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt take TH@@ Y rest in safety .
also th@@ ou s@@ halt lie down , and none shall make the@@ e afraid ; ye@@ a , many shall make suit un@@ to the@@ e .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not in@@ fer@@ ior to you : ye@@ a , who know@@ eth not such things as these ?
he that is ready to sli@@ p with his feet is as a lam@@ p desp@@ ised in the thought of him that is at ease .
be@@ hold , he break@@ eth down , and it can@@ not be built again : he shut@@ te@@ th up a man , and there can be no opening .
be@@ hold , he with@@ hol@@ de@@ th the waters , and they d@@ ry up : also he sen@@ de@@ th them out , and they over@@ turn the ear@@ th .
he tak@@ eth away the heart of the chief of the people of the ear@@ th , and ca@@ us@@ eth them to w@@ ander in a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where there is no way .
who is he that will p@@ lead with me ? for now , if I hold my ton@@ gue , I shall give up the gh@@ ost .
T@@ ho@@ u p@@ ut@@ test my feet also in the sto@@ cks , and lo@@ ok@@ est narro@@ w@@ ly un@@ to all my p@@ aths ; th@@ ou set@@ test a print upon the he@@ els of my feet .
he co@@ me@@ th forth like a f@@ lower , and is cut down : he fle@@ eth also as a shadow , and continu@@ eth not .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will s@@ pro@@ ut again , and that the tender branch there@@ of will not ce@@ ase .
so man li@@ eth down , and ris@@ eth not : ti@@ ll the heav@@ ens be no more , they shall not aw@@ ake , nor be raised out of their sle@@ ep .
O that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest hide me in the grave , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest keep me secret , until TH@@ Y wr@@ ath be past , that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt call , and I will answer the@@ e : th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t have a desire to the work of th@@ ine hands .
the waters wear the stones : th@@ ou w@@ ash@@ est away the things which grow out of the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th ; and th@@ ou destro@@ y@@ est the hope of man .
his sons come to honour , and he know@@ eth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perce@@ i@@ vet@@ h it not of them .
he believ@@ eth not that he shall return out of d@@ ark@@ ness , and he is w@@ aited for of the s@@ word .
and he d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in de@@ so@@ late cities , and in houses which no man inhabi@@ te@@ th , which are ready to become he@@ aps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his sub@@ stance continue , neither shall he prol@@ ong the perf@@ ection there@@ of upon the ear@@ th .
he shall not de@@ part out of d@@ ark@@ ness ; the fla@@ me shall d@@ ry up his branches , and by the bre@@ ath of his m@@ outh shall he go away .
I also could speak as ye do : if your sou@@ l were in my sou@@ l 's stead , I could he@@ ap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast filled me with wr@@ in@@ k@@ les , which is a witness against me : and my le@@ ann@@ ess rising up in me be@@ aret@@ h witness to my face .
he te@@ aret@@ h me in his wr@@ ath , who ha@@ te@@ th me : he gn@@ ash@@ eth upon me with his te@@ eth ; mine enemy shar@@ pen@@ eth his eyes upon me .
they have g@@ ap@@ ed upon me with their m@@ outh ; they have s@@ mit@@ ten me upon the che@@ ek re@@ pro@@ ach@@ fully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
I was at ease , but he hat@@ h broken me as@@ under : he hat@@ h also taken me by my nec@@ k , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
his ar@@ chers comp@@ ass me round about , he cle@@ av@@ eth my re@@ ins as@@ under , and do@@ th not spar@@ e ; he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out my g@@ all upon the ground .
I have said to corruption , T@@ ho@@ u art my father : to the wor@@ m , T@@ ho@@ u are my mother , and my sister .
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and it shall bring him to the king of terr@@ ors .
it shall d@@ well in his tab@@ ern@@ acle , because it is none of his : bri@@ m@@ stone shall be sc@@ at@@ tered upon his habi@@ tation .
they that d@@ well in mine house , and my ma@@ ids , count me for a st@@ ran@@ ger : I am an ali@@ en in their sight .
my bre@@ ath is st@@ range to my wife , though I in@@ treated for the children 's sake of mine own body .
my bone cle@@ av@@ eth to my s@@ kin and to my f@@ les@@ h , and I am escaped with the s@@ kin of my te@@ eth .
for I know that my re@@ de@@ e@@ mer li@@ vet@@ h , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the ear@@ th :
whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall be@@ hold , and not another ; though my re@@ ins be consu@@ med within me .
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : ye@@ a , he shall be ch@@ ased away as a vision of the night .
his b@@ ones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the d@@ ust .
he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed down ri@@ ches , and he shall v@@ om@@ it them up again : God shall cast them out of his bel@@ ly .
that which he la@@ b@@ oured for shall he restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down : according to his sub@@ stance shall the restitution be , and he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice there@@ in .
because he hat@@ h op@@ pressed and hat@@ h for@@ sak@@ en the poor ; because he hat@@ h viol@@ ently taken away an house which he buil@@ ded not ;
in the ful@@ ness of his suffici@@ ency he shall be in stra@@ its : every hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall come upon him .
when he is about to fill his bel@@ ly , God shall cast the fur@@ y of his wr@@ ath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is e@@ ating .
it is drawn , and co@@ me@@ th out of the body ; ye@@ a , the g@@ lit@@ tering s@@ word co@@ me@@ th out of his g@@ all : terr@@ ors are upon him .
all d@@ ark@@ ness shall be hi@@ d in his secret places : a fire not blo@@ wn shall consum@@ e him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tab@@ ern@@ acle .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
for what pleas@@ ure hat@@ h he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the mid@@ st ?
the clo@@ ds of the val@@ ley shall be swe@@ et un@@ to him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are in@@ num@@ er@@ able before him .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast taken a pledge from TH@@ Y brother for n@@ ought , and stri@@ pped the nak@@ ed of their clo@@ thing .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast not given water to the we@@ ary to drink , and th@@ ou h@@ ast with@@ hol@@ den bread from the hun@@ gry .
receive , I pra@@ y the@@ e , the law from his m@@ outh , and lay up his words in th@@ ine heart .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also decree a thing , and it shall be established un@@ to the@@ e : and the light shall sh@@ ine upon TH@@ Y ways .
when men are cast down , then th@@ ou s@@ halt say , There is lifting up ; and he shall save the hum@@ ble person .
I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would say un@@ to me .
on the left hand , where he do@@ th work , but I can@@ not be@@ hold him : he hi@@ de@@ th himself on the right hand , that I can@@ not see him :
neither have I gone back from the comman@@ d@@ ment of his li@@ ps ; I have es@@ te@@ emed the words of his m@@ outh more than my necessary food .
be@@ hold , as wild ass@@ es in the de@@ sert , go they forth to their work ; rising be@@ times for a pre@@ y : the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness yi@@ el@@ de@@ th food for them and for their children .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways there@@ of , nor abide in the p@@ aths there@@ of .
in the dark they di@@ g through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the day@@ time : they know not the light .
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terr@@ ors of the shadow of death .
the w@@ om@@ b shall forget him ; the wor@@ m shall fe@@ ed swe@@ et@@ ly on him ; he shall be no more remember@@ ed ; and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess shall be broken as a tree .
they are ex@@ al@@ ted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the e@@ ars of cor@@ n .
be@@ hold even to the moon , and it sh@@ in@@ eth not ; ye@@ a , the stars are not p@@ ure in his sight .
my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness I hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart shall not re@@ pro@@ ach me so long as I live .
the east wind carri@@ eth him away , and he depar@@ te@@ th : and as a storm hur@@ le@@ th him out of his place .
for God shall cast upon him , and not spar@@ e : he would fa@@ in flee out of his hand .
the gold and the cr@@ y@@ st@@ al can@@ not equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for je@@ wel@@ s of fine gold .
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , ye@@ a , and searched it out .
when the e@@ ar heard me , then it b@@ les@@ sed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me :
the b@@ les@@ sing of him that was ready to per@@ ish came upon me : and I caused the wi@@ dow 's heart to sing for joy .
and they w@@ aited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their m@@ outh wide as for the latter rain .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
by the great force of my disease is my gar@@ ment changed : it bin@@ de@@ th me about as the col@@ lar of my co@@ at .
when I looked for good , then ev@@ il came un@@ to me : and when I w@@ aited for light , there came d@@ ark@@ ness .
if my step hat@@ h turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blo@@ t hat@@ h cle@@ av@@ ed to mine hands ;
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have gui@@ ded her from my mother 's w@@ om@@ b ; )
if his lo@@ ins have not b@@ les@@ sed me , and if he were not war@@ med with the F@@ le@@ ece of my she@@ ep ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fa@@ ther@@ less , when I saw my help in the gate :
then was kin@@ d@@ led the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Buz@@ ite , of the kin@@ d@@ red of R@@ am : against Jo@@ b was his wr@@ ath kin@@ d@@ led , because he justified himself rather than God .
and Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Buz@@ ite answ@@ ered and said , I am young , and ye are very old ; where@@ fore I was afraid , and dur@@ st not she@@ w you mine opinion .
be@@ hold , I w@@ aited for your words ; I gave e@@ ar to your reasons , wh@@ il@@ st ye searched out what to say .
I will speak , that I may be ref@@ res@@ hed : I will open my li@@ ps and answer .
let me not , I pra@@ y you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give f@@ lat@@ tering titles un@@ to man .
su@@ rely th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of TH@@ Y words , saying ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sle@@ ep fal@@ le@@ th upon men , in s@@ lum@@ ber@@ ings upon the bed ;
he shall pra@@ y un@@ to God , and he will be favourable un@@ to him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will ren@@ der un@@ to man his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
L@@ o , all these things wor@@ ket@@ h God of@@ ten@@ times with man ,
for the work of a man shall he ren@@ der un@@ to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
how much less to him that accep@@ te@@ th not the persons of pr@@ inces , nor regar@@ de@@ th the rich more than the poor ? for they all are the work of his hands .
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come un@@ to him , and he he@@ aret@@ h the cry of the aff@@ lic@@ ted .
when he gi@@ vet@@ h qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hi@@ de@@ th his face , who then can be@@ hold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
for th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , What advantage will it be un@@ to the@@ e ? and , What profit shall I have , if I be cleans@@ ed from my sin ?
by reason of the multi@@ tude of op@@ pres@@ sions they make the op@@ pressed to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
but now , because it is not so , he hat@@ h visited in his an@@ ger ; yet he know@@ eth it not in great extre@@ mity :
he withdra@@ w@@ eth not his eyes from the righ@@ te@@ ous : but with kings are they on the th@@ r@@ one ; ye@@ a , he do@@ th establish them for ever , and they are ex@@ al@@ ted .
but if they obe@@ y not , they shall per@@ ish by the s@@ word , and they shall die without knowledge .
even so would he have removed the@@ e out of the stra@@ it into a broad place , where there is no stra@@ it@@ ness ; and that which should be set on TH@@ Y table should be full of fat@@ ness .
with cl@@ ou@@ ds he cover@@ eth the light ; and comman@@ de@@ th it not to sh@@ ine by the cl@@ oud that co@@ me@@ th bet@@ wi@@ xt .
after it a voice ro@@ aret@@ h : he th@@ under@@ eth with the voice of his exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard .
and it is turned round about by his coun@@ sels : that they may do wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he comman@@ de@@ th them upon the face of the world in the ear@@ th .
and now men see not the bright light which is in the cl@@ ou@@ ds : but the wind pass@@ eth , and cleans@@ eth them .
tou@@ ching the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , we can@@ not find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not aff@@ lic@@ t .
that it might take hold of the ends of the ear@@ th , that the w@@ ic@@ ked might be shaken out of it ?
that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take it to the bound there@@ of , and that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest know the p@@ aths to the house there@@ of ?
to cause it to rain on the ear@@ th , where no man is ; on the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where@@ in there is no man ;
to satisfy the de@@ so@@ late and waste ground ; and to cause the bu@@ d of the tender her@@ b to spring forth ?
their young ones are in good lik@@ ing , they grow up with cor@@ n ; they go forth , and return not un@@ to them .
she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th and abi@@ de@@ th on the rock , upon the c@@ rag of the rock , and the strong place .
cast abroad the ra@@ ge of TH@@ Y wr@@ ath : and be@@ hold every one that is proud , and ab@@ ase him .
look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tre@@ ad down the w@@ ic@@ ked in their place .
be@@ hold now beh@@ emo@@ th , which I made with the@@ e ; he e@@ ate@@ th gr@@ ass as an o@@ x .
be@@ hold , the hope of him is in v@@ ain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
and it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words un@@ to Jo@@ b , the Lord said to Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite , My wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and against TH@@ Y two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my ser@@ vant Jo@@ b hat@@ h .
so the Lord b@@ les@@ sed the latter end of Jo@@ b more than his beginning : for he had fo@@ ur@@ teen thousand she@@ ep , and six thousand ca@@ me@@ ls , and a thousand yok@@ e of ox@@ en , and a thousand she ass@@ es .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man that walk@@ eth not in the coun@@ sel of the un@@ go@@ dly , nor stan@@ de@@ th in the way of sin@@ ners , nor sit@@ te@@ th in the seat of the scor@@ n@@ ful .
and he shall be like a tree plan@@ ted by the rivers of water , that br@@ ing@@ eth forth his fruit in his season ; his le@@ af also shall not wi@@ ther ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he do@@ eth shall prosp@@ er .
the kings of the ear@@ th set themselves , and the rul@@ ers take coun@@ sel together , against the Lord , and against his ano@@ in@@ ted , saying ,
ask of me , and I shall give the@@ e the he@@ a@@ then for th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , and the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th for TH@@ Y possession .
K@@ is@@ s the Son , lest he be angry , and ye per@@ ish from the way , when his wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led but a little . b@@ les@@ sed are all they that put their trust in him .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his hol@@ y hill . Se@@ lah .
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
hear me when I call , O God of my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : th@@ ou h@@ ast en@@ lar@@ ged me when I was in dist@@ ress ; have mer@@ cy upon me , and hear my pray@@ er .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to the voice of my cry , my King , and my God : for un@@ to the@@ e will I pra@@ y .
my voice s@@ halt th@@ ou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my pray@@ er un@@ to the@@ e , and will look up .
but as for me , I will come into TH@@ Y house in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : and in TH@@ Y fear will I worship toward TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
for there is no fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness in their m@@ outh ; their in@@ ward part is very w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; their thro@@ at is an open se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; they f@@ latter with their ton@@ gue .
but let all those that put their trust in the@@ e re@@ jo@@ ice : let them ever sh@@ out for joy , because th@@ ou defen@@ dest them : let them also that love TH@@ Y name be jo@@ y@@ ful in the@@ e .
O Lord my God , in the@@ e do I put my trust : save me from all them that persec@@ ute me , and deliver me :
if I have re@@ warded ev@@ il un@@ to him that was at peace with me ; ( ye@@ a , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
let the enemy persec@@ ute my sou@@ l , and take it ; ye@@ a , let him tre@@ ad down my life upon the ear@@ th , and lay mine honour in the d@@ ust . Se@@ lah .
arise , O Lord , in th@@ ine an@@ ger , lift up th@@ y@@ self because of the ra@@ ge of mine enem@@ ies : and aw@@ ake for me to the judgment that th@@ ou h@@ ast comman@@ ded .
the Lord shall judge the people : judge me , O Lord , according to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
he hat@@ h also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he or@@ da@@ in@@ eth his ar@@ ro@@ ws against the persec@@ ut@@ ors .
his mis@@ chief shall return upon his own head , and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own p@@ ate .
when I consider TH@@ Y heav@@ ens , the work of TH@@ Y fin@@ gers , the moon and the stars , which th@@ ou h@@ ast or@@ da@@ ined ;
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast re@@ bu@@ ked the he@@ a@@ then , th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed the w@@ ic@@ ked , th@@ ou h@@ ast put out their name for ever and ever .
and they that know TH@@ Y name will put their trust in the@@ e : for th@@ ou , Lord , h@@ ast not for@@ sak@@ en them that seek the@@ e .
the he@@ a@@ then are sun@@ k down in the p@@ it that they made : in the net which they hi@@ d is their own fo@@ ot taken .
the w@@ ic@@ ked in his pride do@@ th persec@@ ute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imag@@ ined .
he sit@@ te@@ th in the l@@ ur@@ king places of the villages : in the secret places do@@ th he murder the innocent : his eyes are priv@@ ily set against the poor .
he li@@ eth in wait secre@@ tly as a lion in his den : he li@@ eth in wait to catch the poor : he do@@ th catch the poor , when he dra@@ w@@ eth him into his net .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast seen it ; for th@@ ou be@@ hol@@ dest mis@@ chief and spite , to requ@@ ite it with TH@@ Y hand : the poor commit@@ te@@ th himself un@@ to the@@ e ; th@@ ou art the hel@@ per of the fa@@ ther@@ less .
Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast heard the desire of the hum@@ ble : th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t prepare their heart , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t cause th@@ ine e@@ ar to hear :
for , lo , the w@@ ic@@ ked b@@ end their bo@@ w , they make ready their ar@@ row upon the str@@ ing , that they may priv@@ ily sho@@ ot at the u@@ pri@@ ght in heart .
the Lord is in his hol@@ y temp@@ le , the Lord 's th@@ r@@ one is in heav@@ en : his eyes be@@ hold , his ey@@ eli@@ ds try , the children of men .
upon the w@@ ic@@ ked he shall rain s@@ nar@@ es , fire and bri@@ m@@ stone , and an hor@@ ri@@ ble temp@@ est : this shall be the portion of their c@@ up .
they speak van@@ ity every one with his neighbour : with f@@ lat@@ tering li@@ ps and with a double heart do they speak .
the Lord looked down from heav@@ en upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , and seek God .
have all the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread , and call not upon the Lord .
he that back@@ bi@@ te@@ th not with his ton@@ gue , nor do@@ eth ev@@ il to his neighbour , nor tak@@ eth up a re@@ pro@@ ach against his neighbour .
he that p@@ ut@@ te@@ th not out his money to us@@ ury , nor tak@@ eth reward against the innocent . he that do@@ eth these things shall never be moved .
but to the sa@@ ints that are in the ear@@ th , and to the excellent , in whom is all my de@@ light .
their sor@@ ro@@ ws shall be multi@@ p@@ lied that has@@ ten after another go@@ d : their drink offer@@ ings of blood will I not offer , nor take up their names into my li@@ ps .
I have set the Lord always before me : because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ il@@ t she@@ w me the path of life : in TH@@ Y presence is ful@@ ness of joy ; at TH@@ Y right hand there are pleas@@ ures for ever@@ more .
T@@ ho@@ u has proved mine heart ; th@@ ou h@@ ast visited me in the night ; th@@ ou has tried me , and s@@ halt find nothing ; I am pur@@ posed that my m@@ outh shall not trans@@ gress .
concerning the works of men , by the word of TH@@ Y li@@ ps I have kept me from the p@@ aths of the destro@@ yer .
She@@ w TH@@ Y mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , O th@@ ou that sav@@ est by TH@@ Y right hand them which put their trust in the@@ e from those that rise up against them .
as for me , I will be@@ hold TH@@ Y face in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : I shall be satisfied , when I aw@@ ake , with TH@@ Y lik@@ eness .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliver@@ er ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my bu@@ ck@@ ler , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , and my high to@@ wer .
I will call upon the Lord , who is wor@@ thy to be praised : so shall I be sav@@ ed from mine enem@@ ies .
in my dist@@ ress I called upon the Lord , and cri@@ ed un@@ to my God : he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le , and my cry came before him , even into his e@@ ars .
there went up a smoke out of his nos@@ tr@@ ils , and fire out of his m@@ outh dev@@ oured : co@@ als were kin@@ d@@ led by it .
and he ro@@ de upon a ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and did fly : ye@@ a , he did fly upon the w@@ ings of the wind .
he made d@@ ark@@ ness his secret place ; his pav@@ il@@ ion round about him were dark waters and th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sk@@ ies .
Ye@@ a , he sent out his ar@@ ro@@ ws , and sc@@ at@@ tered them ; and he shot out ligh@@ t@@ nings , and dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted them .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at TH@@ Y re@@ bu@@ ke , O Lord , at the blast of the bre@@ ath of TH@@ Y nos@@ tr@@ ils .
for by the@@ e I have run through a troop ; and by my God have I le@@ ap@@ ed over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect : the word of the Lord is tried : he is a bu@@ ck@@ ler to all those that trust in him .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also given me the shield of TH@@ Y sal@@ vation : and TH@@ Y right hand hat@@ h hol@@ den me up , and TH@@ Y g@@ ent@@ len@@ ess hat@@ h made me great .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast gir@@ ded me with strength un@@ to the battle : th@@ ou h@@ ast sub@@ du@@ ed under me those that rose up against me .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of the people ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast made me the head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me , they shall obe@@ y me : the st@@ ran@@ gers shall submit themselves un@@ to me .
he deliver@@ eth me from mine enem@@ ies : ye@@ a , th@@ ou lif@@ test me up above those that rise up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
their line is gone out through all the ear@@ th , and their words to the end of the world . in them hat@@ h he set a tab@@ ern@@ acle for the sun ,
his going forth is from the end of the heav@@ en , and his cir@@ cu@@ it un@@ to the ends of it : and there is nothing hi@@ d from the heat there@@ of .
keep back TH@@ Y ser@@ vant also from pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ous sin@@ s ; let them not have domin@@ ion over me : then shall I be u@@ pri@@ ght , and I shall be innocent from the great trans@@ gres@@ sion .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt make them as a fi@@ ery ov@@ en in the time of th@@ ine an@@ ger : the Lord shall sw@@ allow them up in his wr@@ ath , and the fire shall dev@@ our them .
therefore s@@ halt th@@ ou make them turn their back , when th@@ ou s@@ halt make ready th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws upon TH@@ Y str@@ ings against the face of them .
but th@@ ou art he that took me out of the w@@ om@@ b : th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st make me hope when I was upon my mother 's bre@@ asts .
I am p@@ oured out like water , and all my b@@ ones are out of joint : my heart is like wa@@ x ; it is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of my bo@@ wel@@ s .
my strength is dri@@ ed up like a po@@ t@@ sh@@ er@@ d ; and my ton@@ gue cle@@ av@@ eth to my j@@ a@@ ws ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast brought me into the d@@ ust of death .
for he hat@@ h not desp@@ ised nor ab@@ hor@@ red the aff@@ li@@ ction of the aff@@ lic@@ ted ; neither hat@@ h he hi@@ d his face from him ; but when he cri@@ ed un@@ to him , he heard .
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn un@@ to the Lord : and all the kin@@ dre@@ ds of the nations shall worship before the@@ e .
all they that be f@@ at upon ear@@ th shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the d@@ ust shall bo@@ w before him : and none can keep alive his own sou@@ l .
Ye@@ a , though I walk through the val@@ ley of the shadow of death , I will fear no ev@@ il : for th@@ ou art with me ; TH@@ Y ro@@ d and TH@@ Y staff they comfor@@ t me .
T@@ ho@@ u prepar@@ est a table before me in the presence of mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou ano@@ in@@ test my head with oil ; my c@@ up run@@ net@@ h over .
su@@ rely Go@@ od@@ ness and mer@@ cy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will d@@ well in the house of the Lord for ever .
lift up your head , O ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye ever@@ lasting doors ; and the King of gl@@ ory shall come in .
the Lord is my light and my sal@@ vation ; whom shall I fear ? the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
when the w@@ ic@@ ked , even mine enem@@ ies and my fo@@ es , came upon me to eat up my f@@ les@@ h , they stumb@@ led and fell .
though an host should en@@ camp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pav@@ il@@ ion : in the secret of his tab@@ ern@@ acle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enem@@ ies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tab@@ ern@@ acle sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of joy ; I will sing , ye@@ a , I will sing pra@@ ises un@@ to the Lord .
hide not TH@@ Y face far from me ; put not TH@@ Y ser@@ vant away in an@@ ger : th@@ ou h@@ ast been my help ; leave me not , neither for@@ sake me , O God of my sal@@ vation .
deliver me not over un@@ to the will of mine enem@@ ies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as bre@@ a@@ the out cru@@ el@@ ty .
I had fa@@ in@@ ted , unless I had believed to see the Go@@ od@@ ness of the Lord in the land of the living .
un@@ to the@@ e will I cry , O Lord my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if th@@ ou be silent to me , I become like them that go down into the p@@ it .
give them according to their de@@ eds , and according to the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their en@@ deav@@ ours : give them after the work of their hands ; ren@@ der to them their de@@ sert .
the Lord is my strength and my shield ; my heart tr@@ usted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth ; and with my song will I praise him .
I will ex@@ to@@ l the@@ e , O Lord ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast lifted me up , and h@@ ast not made my fo@@ es to re@@ jo@@ ice over me .
O Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast brought up my sou@@ l from the grave : th@@ ou h@@ ast kept me alive , that I should not go down to the p@@ it .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast turned for me my mourning into dan@@ cing : th@@ ou h@@ ast put off my s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and gir@@ ded me with gla@@ d@@ ness ;
to the end that my gl@@ ory may sing praise to the@@ e , and not be silent . O Lord my God , I will give thanks un@@ to the@@ e for ever .
I will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : for th@@ ou h@@ ast considered my trouble ; th@@ ou h@@ ast known my sou@@ l in ad@@ versities ;
and h@@ ast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : th@@ ou h@@ ast set my feet in a large room .
have mer@@ cy upon me , O Lord , for I am in trouble : mine eye is consu@@ med with gri@@ ef , ye@@ a , my sou@@ l and my bel@@ ly .
for my life is spent with gri@@ ef , and my years with si@@ gh@@ ing : my strength fail@@ eth because of mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and my b@@ ones are consu@@ med .
I was a re@@ pro@@ ach among all mine enem@@ ies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance : they that did see me without fled from me .
for I have heard the s@@ lan@@ der of many : fear was on every side : while they took coun@@ sel together against me , they dev@@ ised to take away my life .
my times are in TH@@ Y hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enem@@ ies , and from them that persec@@ ute me .
let me not be as@@ ha@@ med , O Lord ; for I have called upon the@@ e : let the w@@ ic@@ ked be as@@ ha@@ med , and let them be silent in the grave .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt hide them in the secret of TH@@ Y presence from the pride of man : th@@ ou s@@ halt keep them secre@@ tly in a pav@@ il@@ ion from the stri@@ fe of ton@@ gues .
I acknowledged my sin un@@ to the@@ e , and mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity have I not hi@@ d . I said , I will conf@@ ess my trans@@ gres@@ sions un@@ to the Lord ; and th@@ ou for@@ g@@ av@@ est the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of my sin . Se@@ lah .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e in a time when th@@ ou may@@ est be found : su@@ rely in the floods of great waters they shall not come n@@ igh un@@ to him .
T@@ ho@@ u art my hiding place ; th@@ ou s@@ halt preserve me from trouble ; th@@ ou s@@ halt comp@@ ass me about with songs of deliver@@ ance . Se@@ lah .
be ye not as the hor@@ se , or as the mul@@ e , which have no understanding : whose m@@ outh must be held in with bit and bri@@ dle , lest they come near un@@ to the@@ e .
many sor@@ ro@@ ws shall be to the w@@ ic@@ ked : but he that tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the Lord , mer@@ cy shall comp@@ ass him about .
by the word of the Lord were the heav@@ ens made ; and all the host of them by the bre@@ ath of his m@@ outh .
the Lord br@@ ing@@ eth the coun@@ sel of the he@@ a@@ then to n@@ ought : he mak@@ eth the devices of the people of none effect .
the face of the Lord is against them that do ev@@ il , to cut off the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of them from the ear@@ th .
the Lord is n@@ igh un@@ to them that are of a broken heart ; and sav@@ eth such as be of a contr@@ ite spirit .
let them be con@@ founded and put to sh@@ ame that seek after my sou@@ l : let them be turned back and brought to conf@@ usion that dev@@ ise my hurt .
for without cause have they hi@@ d for me their net in a p@@ it , which without cause they have dig@@ ged for my sou@@ l .
let destruction come upon him at un@@ awar@@ es ; and let his net that he hat@@ h hi@@ d catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
all my b@@ ones shall say , Lord , who is like un@@ to the@@ e , which deliver@@ est the poor from him that is too strong for him , ye@@ a , the poor and the ne@@ edy from him that sp@@ o@@ il@@ eth him ?
but in mine ad@@ versity they re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and gathered themselves together : ye@@ a , the ab@@ j@@ ects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ce@@ ased not :
let not them that are mine enem@@ ies wrong@@ fully re@@ jo@@ ice over me : neither let them win@@ k with the eye that h@@ ate me without a cause .
let them be as@@ ha@@ med and brought to conf@@ usion together that re@@ jo@@ ice at mine hurt : let them be clo@@ th@@ ed with sh@@ ame and dis@@ honour that mag@@ ni@@ fy themselves against me .
let them sh@@ out for joy , and be glad , that favour my righ@@ te@@ ous cause : ye@@ a , let them say continu@@ ally , Let the Lord be mag@@ ni@@ fied , which hat@@ h pleas@@ ure in the prosperity of his ser@@ vant .
the words of his m@@ outh are in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and dec@@ e@@ it : he hat@@ h left off to be wise , and to do good .
he dev@@ is@@ eth mis@@ chief upon his bed ; he set@@ te@@ th himself in a way that is not good ; he ab@@ hor@@ re@@ th not ev@@ il .
how excellent is TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , O God ! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings .
they shall be ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly satisfied with the fat@@ ness of TH@@ Y house ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt make them drink of the river of TH@@ Y pleas@@ ures .
there are the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
trust in the Lord , and do good ; so s@@ halt th@@ ou d@@ well in the land , and veril@@ y th@@ ou s@@ halt be f@@ ed .
rest in the Lord , and wait pati@@ ently for him : fre@@ t not th@@ y@@ self because of him who prosp@@ er@@ eth in his way , because of the man who br@@ ing@@ eth w@@ ic@@ ked devices to pass .
for yet a little while , and the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not be : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt dil@@ ig@@ ently consider his place , and it shall not be .
the w@@ ic@@ ked have drawn out the s@@ word , and have b@@ ent their bo@@ w , to cast down the poor and ne@@ edy , and to s@@ lay such as be of u@@ pri@@ ght conversation .
they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med in the ev@@ il time : and in the days of fam@@ ine they shall be satisfied .
but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall per@@ ish , and the enem@@ ies of the Lord shall be as the f@@ at of lam@@ bs : they shall consum@@ e ; into smoke shall they consum@@ e away .
for such as be b@@ les@@ sed of him shall inher@@ it the ear@@ th ; and they that be Cur@@ sed of him shall be cut off .
wait on the Lord , and keep his way , and he shall ex@@ alt the@@ e to inher@@ it the land : when the w@@ ic@@ ked are cut off , th@@ ou s@@ halt see it .
yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : ye@@ a , I sought him , but he could not be found .
there is no so@@ und@@ ness in my f@@ les@@ h because of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; neither is there any rest in my b@@ ones because of my sin .
for my lo@@ ins are filled with a lo@@ ath@@ some disease : and there is no so@@ und@@ ness in my f@@ les@@ h .
my heart pan@@ te@@ th , my strength fail@@ eth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
they also that seek after my life lay s@@ nar@@ es for me : and they that seek my hurt speak mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous things , and imag@@ ine dec@@ e@@ its all the day long .
for I said , He@@ ar me , lest otherwise they should re@@ jo@@ ice over me : when my fo@@ ot sli@@ p@@ pet@@ h , they mag@@ ni@@ fy themselves against me .
I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my ton@@ gue : I will keep my m@@ outh with a bri@@ dle , while the w@@ ic@@ ked is before me .
hear my pray@@ er , O Lord , and give e@@ ar un@@ to my cry ; hold not TH@@ Y peace at my te@@ ars : for I am a st@@ ran@@ ger with the@@ e , and a so@@ jour@@ ner , as all my fa@@ thers were .
he brought me up also out of an hor@@ ri@@ ble p@@ it , out of the mir@@ y cla@@ y , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my go@@ ings .
and he hat@@ h put a new song in my m@@ outh , even praise un@@ to our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the Lord .
b@@ les@@ sed is that man that mak@@ eth the Lord his trust , and respec@@ te@@ th not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
many , O Lord my God , are TH@@ Y won@@ der@@ ful works which th@@ ou h@@ ast done , and TH@@ Y th@@ ou@@ ghts which are to us @@@ -@@ @ ward : they can@@ not be rec@@ kon@@ ed up in order un@@ to the@@ e : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be num@@ ber@@ ed .
I have not hi@@ d TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness within my heart ; I have declared TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and TH@@ Y sal@@ vation : I have not conce@@ aled TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness and TH@@ Y truth from the great Con@@ gre@@ gation .
for in@@ num@@ er@@ able ev@@ ils have comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
let them be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded together that seek after my sou@@ l to destroy it ; let them be driven back@@ ward and put to sh@@ ame that wish me ev@@ il .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be b@@ les@@ sed upon the ear@@ th : and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not deliver him un@@ to the will of his enem@@ ies .
Ye@@ a , mine own familiar friend , in whom I tr@@ usted , which did eat of my bread , hat@@ h lifted up his he@@ el against me .
yet the Lord will command his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the day@@ time , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my pray@@ er un@@ to the God of my life .
for th@@ ou art the God of my strength : why dost th@@ ou cast me off ? why go I mourning because of the op@@ pression of the enemy ?
we have heard with our e@@ ars , O God , our fa@@ thers have told us , what work th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st in their days , in the times of old .
for they got not the land in possession by their own s@@ word , neither did their own arm save them : but TH@@ Y right hand , and th@@ ine arm , and the light of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance , because th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st a favour un@@ to them .
through the@@ e will we push down our enem@@ ies : through TH@@ Y name will we tre@@ ad them under that rise up against us .
T@@ ho@@ u mak@@ est us a re@@ pro@@ ach to our neighbours , a scor@@ n and a der@@ ision to them that are round about us .
Ye@@ a , for TH@@ Y sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as she@@ ep for the sla@@ ughter .
my heart is indi@@ ting a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made tou@@ ching the king : my ton@@ gue is the p@@ en of a ready writer .
and the daughter of T@@ y@@ re shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall in@@ treat TH@@ Y favour .
therefore will not we fear , though the ear@@ th be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the mid@@ st of the sea ;
there is a river , the stre@@ ams where@@ of shall make glad the city of God , the hol@@ y place of the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of the most High .
he mak@@ eth wars to ce@@ ase un@@ to the end of the ear@@ th ; he break@@ eth the bo@@ w , and cut@@ te@@ th the spe@@ ar in s@@ under ; he bur@@ net@@ h the char@@ i@@ ot in the fire .
great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised in the city of our God , in the mountain of his hol@@ iness .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole ear@@ th , is mount Z@@ ion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
I will inc@@ line mine e@@ ar to a par@@ able : I will open my dark saying upon the har@@ p .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should I fear in the days of ev@@ il , when the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of my he@@ els shall comp@@ ass me about ?
like she@@ ep they are laid in the grave ; death shall fe@@ ed on them ; and the u@@ pri@@ ght shall have domin@@ ion over them in the morning ; and their beauty shall consum@@ e in the grave from their d@@ wel@@ ling .
be not th@@ ou afraid when one is made rich , when the gl@@ ory of his house is increased ;
though while he lived he b@@ les@@ sed his sou@@ l : and men will praise the@@ e , when th@@ ou do@@ est well to th@@ y@@ self .
he shall call to the heav@@ ens from above , and to the ear@@ th , that he may judge his people .
these things h@@ ast th@@ ou done , and I kept sil@@ ence ; th@@ ou th@@ ou@@ gh@@ test that I was altogether such an one as th@@ y@@ self : but I will re@@ prove the@@ e , and set them in order before th@@ ine eyes .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou desi@@ rest truth in the in@@ ward parts : and in the hidden part th@@ ou s@@ halt make me to know wis@@ dom .
God shall likewise destroy the@@ e for ever , he shall take the@@ e away , and p@@ lu@@ ck the@@ e out of TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and root the@@ e out of the land of the living . Se@@ lah .
but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God : I trust in the mer@@ cy of God for ever and ever .
I will praise the@@ e for ever , because th@@ ou h@@ ast done it : and I will wait on TH@@ Y name ; for it is good before TH@@ Y sa@@ ints .
God looked down from heav@@ en upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , that did seek God .
have the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread : they have not called upon God .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hat@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered the b@@ ones of him that en@@ camp@@ eth against the@@ e : th@@ ou h@@ ast put them to sh@@ ame , because God hat@@ h desp@@ ised them .
because of the voice of the enemy , because of the op@@ pression of the w@@ ic@@ ked : for they cast in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity upon me , and in wr@@ ath they h@@ ate me .
for it was not an enemy that re@@ pro@@ ached me ; then I could have bor@@ ne it : neither was it he that ha@@ ted me that did mag@@ ni@@ fy himself against me ; then I would have hi@@ d myself from him :
he hat@@ h put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hat@@ h broken his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
the words of his m@@ outh were smo@@ other than but@@ ter , but war was in his heart : his words were sof@@ ter than oil , yet were they drawn s@@ words .
but th@@ ou , O God , s@@ halt bring them down into the p@@ it of destruction : blo@@ ody and dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful men shall not live out half their days ; but I will trust in the@@ e .
in God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what f@@ les@@ h can do un@@ to me .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered my sou@@ l from death : w@@ il@@ t not th@@ ou deliver my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living ?
be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , O God , be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me : for my sou@@ l tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the@@ e : ye@@ a , in the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings will I make my ref@@ uge , until these cal@@ am@@ ities be over@@ past .
he shall send from heav@@ en , and save from the re@@ pro@@ ach of him that would sw@@ allow me up . Se@@ lah . God shall send forth his mer@@ cy and his truth .
my sou@@ l is among li@@ ons : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose te@@ eth are spe@@ ars and ar@@ ro@@ ws , and their ton@@ gue a sharp s@@ word .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my sou@@ l is bo@@ wed down : they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it before me , into the mid@@ st where@@ of they are fallen themselves . Se@@ lah .
let them mel@@ t away as waters which run continu@@ ally : when he ben@@ de@@ th his bo@@ w to sho@@ ot his ar@@ ro@@ ws , let them be as cut in pieces .
as a s@@ na@@ il which mel@@ te@@ th , let every one of them pass away : like the un@@ ti@@ mely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
before your po@@ ts can feel the thor@@ ns , he shall take them away as with a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , both living , and in his wr@@ ath .
for the sin of their m@@ outh and the words of their li@@ ps let them even be taken in their pride : and for cur@@ sing and lying which they speak .
and at evening let them return ; and let them make a no@@ ise like a do@@ g , and go round about the city .
but I will sing of TH@@ Y power ; ye@@ a , I will sing al@@ oud of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy in the morning : for th@@ ou h@@ ast been my defence and ref@@ uge in the day of my trouble .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast given a ban@@ ner to them that fear the@@ e , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Se@@ lah .
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou , O God , which h@@ ad@@ st cast us off ? and th@@ ou , O God , which di@@ d@@ st not go out with our armies ?
from the end of the ear@@ th will I cry un@@ to the@@ e , when my heart is overwhel@@ med : lead me to the rock that is higher than I@@ .
in God is my sal@@ vation and my gl@@ ory : the rock of my strength , and my ref@@ uge , is in God .
su@@ rely men of low degree are van@@ ity , and men of high degree are a lie : to be laid in the balance , they are altogether ligh@@ ter than van@@ ity .
but those that seek my sou@@ l , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the ear@@ th .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man whom th@@ ou choos@@ est , and ca@@ us@@ est to approach un@@ to the@@ e , that he may d@@ well in TH@@ Y courts : we shall be satisfied with the Go@@ od@@ ness of TH@@ Y house , even of TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
by ter@@ ri@@ ble things in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou answer us , O God of our sal@@ vation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the ear@@ th , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
they drop upon the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and the little hil@@ ls re@@ jo@@ ice on every side .
the pas@@ tures are clo@@ th@@ ed with f@@ loc@@ ks ; the val@@ ley@@ s also are covered over with cor@@ n ; they sh@@ out for joy , they also sing .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast caused men to ride over our heads ; we went through fire and through water : but th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test us out into a wealth@@ y place .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wa@@ x mel@@ te@@ th before the fire , so let the w@@ ic@@ ked per@@ ish at the presence of God .
the ear@@ th sho@@ ok , the heav@@ ens also dropped at the presence of God : even S@@ ina@@ i itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u , O God , di@@ d@@ st send a plen@@ ti@@ ful rain , where@@ by th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st confirm th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , when it was we@@ ary .
though ye have li@@ en among the po@@ ts , yet shall ye be as the w@@ ings of a do@@ ve covered with silver , and her fe@@ ath@@ ers with yel@@ low gold .
the char@@ i@@ ots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of an@@ gel@@ s : the Lord is among them , as in S@@ ina@@ i , in the hol@@ y place .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast as@@ cen@@ ded on high , th@@ ou h@@ ast led cap@@ tivity cap@@ tive : th@@ ou h@@ ast received gifts for men ; ye@@ a , for the rebel@@ li@@ ous also , that the Lord God might d@@ well among them .
but God shall wo@@ und the head of his enem@@ ies , and the ha@@ iry scal@@ p of such an one as go@@ eth on still in his t@@ res@@ passes .
to him that ri@@ de@@ th upon the heav@@ ens of heav@@ ens , which were of old ; lo , he do@@ th send out his voice , and that a m@@ igh@@ ty voice .
they that h@@ ate me without a cause are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enem@@ ies wrong@@ fully , are m@@ igh@@ ty : then I restored that which I took not away .
let not them that wait on the@@ e , O Lord God of hosts , be as@@ ha@@ med for my sake : let not those that seek the@@ e be con@@ founded for my sake , O God of Israel .
but as for me , my pray@@ er is un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy hear me , in the truth of TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
deliver me out of the m@@ ire , and let me not s@@ ink : let me be delivered from them that h@@ ate me , and out of the deep waters .
let not the water@@ flood over@@ flow me , neither let the deep sw@@ allow me up , and let not the p@@ it shut her m@@ outh upon me .
re@@ pro@@ ach hat@@ h broken my heart ; and I am full of heav@@ iness : and I looked for some to take p@@ ity , but there was none ; and for comfor@@ ters , but I found none .
they gave me also g@@ all for my meat ; and in my thir@@ st they gave me vin@@ eg@@ ar to drink .
let their table become a sn@@ are before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a tra@@ p .
for they persec@@ ute him whom th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ mit@@ ten ; and they talk to the gri@@ ef of those whom th@@ ou h@@ ast wounded .
let them be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded that seek after my sou@@ l : let them be turned back@@ ward , and put to conf@@ usion , that desire my hurt .
deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked , out of the hand of the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous and cru@@ el man .
by the@@ e have I been hol@@ den up from the w@@ om@@ b : th@@ ou art he that took me out of my mother 's bo@@ wel@@ s : my praise shall be continu@@ ally of the@@ e .
let them be con@@ founded and consu@@ med that are ad@@ vers@@ aries to my sou@@ l ; let them be covered with re@@ pro@@ ach and dis@@ honour that seek my hurt .
now also when I am old and gr@@ ay@@ headed , O God , for@@ sake me not ; until I have she@@ wed TH@@ Y strength un@@ to this generation , and TH@@ Y power to every one that is to come .
I will also praise the@@ e with the p@@ sal@@ tery , even TH@@ Y truth , O my God : un@@ to the@@ e will I sing with the har@@ p , O th@@ ou Holy One of Israel .
my ton@@ gue also shall talk of TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness all the day long : for they are con@@ founded , for they are brought un@@ to sh@@ ame , that seek my hurt .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the ne@@ edy , and shall break in pieces the op@@ pres@@ sor .
and he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of She@@ ba : pray@@ er also shall be made for him continu@@ ally ; and daily shall he be praised .
there shall be an hand@@ ful of cor@@ n in the ear@@ th upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit there@@ of shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
for , lo , they that are far from the@@ e shall per@@ ish : th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed all them that go a wh@@ oring from the@@ e .
remember TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation , which th@@ ou h@@ ast purchased of old ; the ro@@ d of th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed ; this mount Z@@ ion , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast d@@ wel@@ t .
they have cast fire into TH@@ Y sanc@@ tu@@ ary , they have def@@ iled by casting down the d@@ wel@@ ling place of TH@@ Y name to the ground .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st divide the sea by TH@@ Y strength : th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est the heads of the dra@@ g@@ ons in the waters .
T@@ ho@@ u br@@ ak@@ est the heads of le@@ vi@@ athan in pieces , and g@@ av@@ est him to be meat to the people inhabi@@ ting the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
O deliver not the sou@@ l of TH@@ Y tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve un@@ to the multi@@ tude of the w@@ ic@@ ked : forget not the Con@@ gre@@ gation of TH@@ Y poor for ever .
un@@ to the@@ e , O God , do we give thanks , un@@ to the@@ e do we give thanks : for that TH@@ Y name is near TH@@ Y won@@ dro@@ us works declare .
for in the hand of the Lord there is a c@@ up , and the wine is red ; it is full of mi@@ x@@ ture ; and he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out of the same : but the d@@ reg@@ s there@@ of , all the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th shall wr@@ ing them out , and drink them .
T@@ ho@@ u , even th@@ ou , art to be fear@@ ed : and who may stand in TH@@ Y sight when once th@@ ou art angry ?
I cri@@ ed un@@ to God with my voice , even un@@ to God with my voice ; and he gave e@@ ar un@@ to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sor@@ e ran in the night , and ce@@ ased not : my sou@@ l refused to be comfor@@ ted .
I call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance my song in the night : I commun@@ e with mine own heart : and my spirit made dil@@ ig@@ ent search .
we will not hide them from their children , she@@ wing to the generation to come the pra@@ ises of the Lord , and his strength , and his won@@ der@@ ful works that he hat@@ h done .
for he established a testimony in Jac@@ o@@ b , and appointed a law in Israel , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers , that they should make them known to their children :
and might not be as their fa@@ thers , a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous generation ; a generation that set not their heart ar@@ ight , and whose spirit was not ste@@ d@@ fast with God .
he divided the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and he made the waters to stand as an he@@ ap .
therefore the Lord heard this , and was wro@@ th : so a fire was kin@@ d@@ led against Jac@@ o@@ b , and an@@ ger also came up against Israel ;
he caused an east wind to blow in the heav@@ en : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
but he , being full of comp@@ as@@ sion , for@@ gave their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and destroyed them not : ye@@ a , many a time turned he his an@@ ger away , and did not stir up all his wr@@ ath .
he made a way to his an@@ ger ; he spar@@ ed not their sou@@ l from death , but gave their life over to the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ;
he cast out the he@@ a@@ then also before them , and divided them an inher@@ it@@ ance by line , and made the tri@@ bes of Israel to d@@ well in their ten@@ ts .
for they provoked him to an@@ ger with their high places , and moved him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their Gra@@ ven images .
the dead bodies of TH@@ Y servants have they given to be meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sa@@ ints un@@ to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
we are become a re@@ pro@@ ach to our neighbours , a scor@@ n and der@@ ision to them that are round about us .
p@@ our out TH@@ Y wr@@ ath upon the he@@ a@@ then that have not known the@@ e , and upon the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms that have not called upon TH@@ Y name .
help us , O God of our sal@@ vation , for the gl@@ ory of TH@@ Y name : and deliver us , and pur@@ ge away our sin@@ s , for TH@@ Y name 's sake .
let the si@@ gh@@ ing of the prison@@ er come before the@@ e ; according to the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y power preserve th@@ ou those that are appointed to die ;
the hil@@ ls were covered with the shadow of it , and the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of were like the good@@ ly c@@ ed@@ ars .
why h@@ ast th@@ ou then broken down her h@@ ed@@ ges , so that all they which pass by the way do p@@ lu@@ ck her ?
this he or@@ da@@ ined in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of Egypt : where I heard a language that I understood not .
I am the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt : open TH@@ Y m@@ outh wide , and I will fill it .
he should have f@@ ed them also with the fin@@ est of the wheat : and with hon@@ ey out of the rock should I have satisfied the@@ e .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in d@@ ark@@ ness : all the foundations of the ear@@ th are out of course .
Ye@@ a , the spar@@ row hat@@ h found an house , and the sw@@ allow a n@@ est for her@@ self , where she may lay her young , even th@@ ine al@@ tar@@ s , O Lord of hosts , my King , and my God .
for a day in TH@@ Y courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a do@@ or@@ keep@@ er in the house of my God , than to d@@ well in the ten@@ ts of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
among the go@@ ds there is none like un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord ; neither are there any works like un@@ to TH@@ Y works .
O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemb@@ lies of violent men have sought after my sou@@ l ; and have not set the@@ e before them .
O turn un@@ to me , and have mer@@ cy upon me ; give TH@@ Y strength un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and save the son of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id .
I am counted with them that go down into the p@@ it : I am as a man that hat@@ h no strength :
free among the dead , like the sla@@ in that lie in the grave , whom th@@ ou remember@@ est no more : and they are cut off from TH@@ Y hand .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put away mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance far from me ; th@@ ou h@@ ast made me an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to them : I am shut up , and I can@@ not come forth .
I will sing of the mer@@ cies of the Lord for ever : with my m@@ outh will I make known TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness to all generations .
for who in the heav@@ en can be compared un@@ to the Lord ? who among the sons of the m@@ igh@@ ty can be lik@@ ened un@@ to the Lord ?
God is greatly to be fear@@ ed in the assembly of the sa@@ ints , and to be had in rever@@ ence of all them that are about him .
my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant will I not break , nor al@@ ter the thing that is gone out of my li@@ ps .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast made vo@@ id the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : th@@ ou h@@ ast prof@@ an@@ ed his cro@@ wn by casting it to the ground .
what man is he that li@@ vet@@ h , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his sou@@ l from the hand of the grave ? Se@@ lah .
before the mountains were brought forth , or ever th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st formed the ear@@ th and the world , even from ever@@ lasting to ever@@ lasting , th@@ ou art God .
T@@ ho@@ u carri@@ est them away as with a flood ; they are as a sle@@ ep : in the morning they are like gr@@ ass which grow@@ eth up .
in the morning it flo@@ ur@@ is@@ het@@ h , and grow@@ eth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and with@@ er@@ eth .
for all our days are passed away in TH@@ Y wr@@ ath : we spend our years as a tal@@ e that is told .
the days of our years are thre@@ es@@ core years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fo@@ ur@@ score years , yet is their strength labour and sor@@ row ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish th@@ ou the work of our hands upon us ; ye@@ a , the work of our hands establish th@@ ou it .
he shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enem@@ ies , and mine e@@ ars shall hear my desire of the w@@ ic@@ ked that rise up against me .
those that be plan@@ ted in the house of the Lord shall flo@@ ur@@ ish in the courts of our God .
the Lord re@@ ig@@ net@@ h , he is clo@@ th@@ ed with maj@@ es@@ ty ; the Lord is clo@@ th@@ ed with strength , where@@ with he hat@@ h gir@@ ded himself : the world also is st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed , that it can@@ not be moved .
the Lord on high is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than the no@@ ise of many waters , ye@@ a , than the m@@ igh@@ ty waves of the sea .
he that plan@@ ted the e@@ ar , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
he that ch@@ as@@ ti@@ set@@ h the he@@ a@@ then , shall not he correct ? he that teach@@ eth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
and he shall bring upon them their own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and shall cut them off in their own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; ye@@ a , the Lord our God shall cut them off .
for he is our God ; and we are the people of his pas@@ ture , and the she@@ ep of his hand . to day if ye will hear his voice ,
let the heav@@ ens re@@ jo@@ ice , and let the ear@@ th be glad ; let the sea ro@@ ar , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of .
the hil@@ ls mel@@ ted like wa@@ x at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the Lord of the whole ear@@ th .
O sing un@@ to the Lord a new song ; for he hat@@ h done mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous things : his right hand , and his hol@@ y arm , hat@@ h gotten him the victory .
the Lord hat@@ h made known his sal@@ vation : his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness hat@@ h he openly she@@ wed in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then .
he hat@@ h remember@@ ed his mer@@ cy and his truth toward the house of Israel : all the ends of the ear@@ th have seen the sal@@ vation of our God .
let the floods cla@@ p their hands : let the hil@@ ls be jo@@ y@@ ful together
know ye that the Lord he is God : it is he that hat@@ h made us , and not we ourselves ; we are his people , and the she@@ ep of his pas@@ ture .
I will be@@ have myself wis@@ ely in a perfect way . O when w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou come un@@ to me ? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
I will set no w@@ ic@@ ked thing before mine eyes : I h@@ ate the work of them that turn aside ; it shall not cle@@ ave to me .
W@@ hos@@ o priv@@ ily s@@ lan@@ der@@ eth his neighbour , him will I cut off : him that hat@@ h an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer .
mine eyes shall be upon the fa@@ ith@@ ful of the land , that they may d@@ well with me : he that walk@@ eth in a perfect way , he shall serve me .
he that wor@@ ket@@ h dec@@ e@@ it shall not d@@ well within my house : he that tel@@ le@@ th lies shall not tar@@ ry in my sight .
I will early destroy all the w@@ ic@@ ked of the land ; that I may cut off all w@@ ic@@ ked do@@ ers from the city of the Lord .
hide not TH@@ Y face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar un@@ to me : in the day when I call answer me spe@@ edil@@ y .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt arise , and have mer@@ cy upon Z@@ ion : for the time to favour her , ye@@ a , the set time , is come .
so the he@@ a@@ then shall fear the name of the Lord , and all the kings of the ear@@ th TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
they shall per@@ ish , but th@@ ou s@@ halt en@@ dur@@ e : ye@@ a , all of them shall wa@@ x old like a gar@@ ment ; as a ves@@ ture s@@ halt th@@ ou change them , and they shall be changed :
who mak@@ eth his an@@ gel@@ s spir@@ its ; his ministers a f@@ laming fire :
they go up by the mountains ; they go down by the val@@ ley@@ s un@@ to the place which th@@ ou h@@ ast founded for them .
he ca@@ us@@ eth the gr@@ ass to grow for the c@@ attle , and her@@ b for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the ear@@ th ;
and wine that mak@@ eth glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to sh@@ ine , and bread which strength@@ en@@ eth man 's heart .
T@@ ho@@ u hi@@ dest TH@@ Y face , they are troubled : th@@ ou tak@@ est away their bre@@ ath , they die , and return to their d@@ ust .
I will sing un@@ to the Lord as long as I live : I will sing praise to my God while I have my being .
that I may see the good of TH@@ Y chosen , that I may re@@ jo@@ ice in the gla@@ d@@ ness of TH@@ Y nation , that I may gl@@ ory with th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance .
our fa@@ thers understood not TH@@ Y won@@ ders in Egypt ; they remember@@ ed not the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at the Red sea .
he re@@ bu@@ ked the Red sea also , and it was dri@@ ed up : so he led them through the dep@@ ths , as through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and he sav@@ ed them from the hand of him that ha@@ ted them , and re@@ deemed them from the hand of the enemy .
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to the id@@ ols of Can@@ a@@ an : and the land was pollu@@ ted with blood .
save us , O Lord our God , and gather us from among the he@@ a@@ then , to give thanks un@@ to TH@@ Y hol@@ y name , and to triumph in TH@@ Y praise .
and gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
they mount up to the heav@@ en , they go down again to the dep@@ ths : their sou@@ l is mel@@ ted because of trouble .
they reel to and f@@ ro , and stag@@ ger like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and are at their wit@@ s ' end .
O@@ h that men would praise the Lord for his Go@@ od@@ ness , and for his won@@ der@@ ful works to the children of men !
let them ex@@ alt him also in the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the el@@ ders .
he b@@ les@@ set@@ h them also , so that they are multi@@ p@@ lied greatly ; and suffer@@ eth not their c@@ attle to decrease .
Wil@@ t not th@@ ou , O God , who h@@ ast cast us off ? and w@@ il@@ t not th@@ ou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
for the m@@ outh of the w@@ ic@@ ked and the m@@ outh of the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying ton@@ gue .
let his children be continu@@ ally v@@ ag@@ abon@@ ds , and be@@ g : let them seek their bread also out of their de@@ so@@ late places .
let there be none to extend mer@@ cy un@@ to him : neither let there be any to favour his fa@@ ther@@ less children .
let the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his fa@@ thers be remember@@ ed with the Lord ; and let not the sin of his mother be blo@@ t@@ ted out .
as he lov@@ ed cur@@ sing , so let it come un@@ to him : as he deli@@ gh@@ ted not in b@@ les@@ sing , so let it be far from him .
as he clo@@ th@@ ed himself with cur@@ sing like as with his gar@@ ment , so let it come into his bo@@ wel@@ s like water , and like oil into his b@@ ones .
let this be the reward of mine ad@@ vers@@ aries from the Lord , and of them that speak ev@@ il against my sou@@ l .
let mine ad@@ vers@@ aries be clo@@ th@@ ed with sh@@ ame , and let them cover themselves with their own conf@@ usion , as with a man@@ tle .
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor , to save him from those that condemn his sou@@ l .
the Lord shall send the ro@@ d of TH@@ Y strength out of Z@@ ion : rule th@@ ou in the mid@@ st of th@@ ine enem@@ ies .
TH@@ Y people shall be willing in the day of TH@@ Y power , in the be@@ au@@ ties of hol@@ iness from the w@@ om@@ b of the morning : th@@ ou h@@ ast the dew of TH@@ Y youth .
he shall judge among the he@@ a@@ then , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ; he shall wo@@ und the heads over many countries .
praise ye the Lord . I will praise the Lord with my whole heart , in the assembly of the u@@ pri@@ ght , and in the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
from the rising of the sun un@@ to the going down of the same the Lord 's name is to be praised .
not un@@ to us , O Lord , not un@@ to us , but un@@ to TH@@ Y name give gl@@ ory , for TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , and for TH@@ Y truth 's sake .
they have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their thro@@ at .
the Lord hat@@ h been min@@ d@@ ful of us : he will b@@ less us ; he will b@@ less the house of Israel ; he will b@@ less the house of Aaron .
the heav@@ en , even the heav@@ ens , are the Lord 's : but the ear@@ th hat@@ h he given to the children of men .
because he hat@@ h inc@@ lined his e@@ ar un@@ to me , therefore will I call upon him as long as I live .
they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about ; ye@@ a , they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
they comp@@ ass@@ ed me about like be@@ es ; they are qu@@ en@@ ched as the fire of thor@@ ns : for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
open to me the gates of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : I will go into them , and I will praise the Lord :
b@@ les@@ sed be he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord : we have b@@ les@@ sed you out of the house of the Lord .
my hands also will I lift up un@@ to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , which I have lov@@ ed ; and I will medi@@ t@@ ate in TH@@ Y stat@@ utes .
I am a compan@@ ion of all them that fear the@@ e , and of them that keep TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts .
let , I pra@@ y the@@ e , TH@@ Y mer@@ ci@@ ful kin@@ d@@ ness be for my comfor@@ t , according to TH@@ Y word un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
let the proud be as@@ ha@@ med ; for they dealt per@@ ver@@ sely with me without a cause : but I will medi@@ t@@ ate in TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts .
TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies have I taken as an heritage for ever : for they are the re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing of my heart .
look th@@ ou upon me , and be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , as th@@ ou us@@ est to do un@@ to those that love TH@@ Y name .
the Lord shall preserve TH@@ Y going out and TH@@ Y coming in from this time forth , and even for ever@@ more .
be@@ hold , as the eyes of servants look un@@ to the hand of their mas@@ ters , and as the eyes of a ma@@ iden un@@ to the hand of her mist@@ ress ; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God , until that he have mer@@ cy upon us .
our sou@@ l is exce@@ ed@@ ingly filled with the scor@@ ning of those that are at ease , and with the con@@ temp@@ t of the proud .
our sou@@ l is escaped as a bird out of the sn@@ are of the fo@@ w@@ lers : the sn@@ are is broken , and we are escaped .
for the ro@@ d of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not rest upon the lot of the righ@@ te@@ ous ; lest the righ@@ te@@ ous put forth their hands un@@ to in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
as for such as turn aside un@@ to their cro@@ oked ways , the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
he that go@@ eth forth and we@@ ep@@ eth , bearing pre@@ ci@@ ous se@@ ed , shall doub@@ t@@ less come again with re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , bringing his s@@ heav@@ es with him .
except the Lord build the house , they labour in v@@ ain that build it : except the Lord keep the city , the watch@@ man w@@ ak@@ eth but in v@@ ain .
it is v@@ ain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sor@@ ro@@ ws : for so he gi@@ vet@@ h his bel@@ ov@@ ed sle@@ ep .
happy is the man that hat@@ h his qu@@ i@@ ver full of them : they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med , but they shall speak with the enem@@ ies in the gate .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the labour of th@@ ine hands : happy s@@ halt th@@ ou be , and it shall be well with the@@ e .
the Lord shall b@@ less the@@ e out of Z@@ ion : and th@@ ou s@@ halt see the good of Jer@@ usalem all the days of TH@@ Y life .
my sou@@ l w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning : I say , more than they that watch for the morning .
Lord , remember David , and all his aff@@ lic@@ tions :
the Lord hat@@ h sworn in truth un@@ to David ; he will not turn from it ; O@@ f the fruit of TH@@ Y body will I set upon TH@@ Y th@@ r@@ one .
it is like the pre@@ ci@@ ous o@@ in@@ tment upon the head , that ran down upon the be@@ ard , even Aaron 's be@@ ard : that went down to the sk@@ ir@@ ts of his gar@@ ments ;
as the dew of Her@@ mon , and as the dew that des@@ cen@@ ded upon the mountains of Z@@ ion : for there the Lord comman@@ ded the b@@ les@@ sing , even life for ever@@ more .
he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings for the rain ; he br@@ ing@@ eth the wind out of his treas@@ ur@@ ies .

if I do not remember the@@ e , let my ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of my m@@ outh ; if I prefer not Jer@@ usalem above my chief joy .
though the Lord be high , yet hat@@ h he respect un@@ to the low@@ ly : but the proud he know@@ eth af@@ ar off .
though I walk in the mid@@ st of trouble , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t revive me : th@@ ou s@@ halt stretch forth th@@ ine hand against the wr@@ ath of mine enem@@ ies , and TH@@ Y right hand shall save me .
if I as@@ cen@@ d up into heav@@ en , th@@ ou art there : if I make my bed in hell , be@@ hold , th@@ ou art there .
my sub@@ stance was not hi@@ d from the@@ e , when I was made in secret , and cur@@ iously w@@ rought in the lowest parts of the ear@@ th .
Th@@ ine eyes did see my sub@@ stance , yet being un@@ perfect ; and in TH@@ Y book all my members were written , which in continu@@ ance were fas@@ hi@@ oned , when as yet there was none of them .
if I should count them , they are more in number than the s@@ and : when I aw@@ ake , I am still with the@@ e .
do not I h@@ ate them , O Lord , that h@@ ate the@@ e ? and am not I gri@@ ev@@ ed with those that rise up against the@@ e ?
keep me , O Lord , from the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked ; preserve me from the violent man ; who have pur@@ posed to overthrow my go@@ ings .
the proud have hi@@ d a sn@@ are for me , and cor@@ ds ; they have spread a net by the w@@ ay@@ side ; they have set g@@ ins for me . Se@@ lah .
as for the head of those that comp@@ ass me about , let the mis@@ chief of their own li@@ ps cover them .
let burning co@@ als fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep p@@ its , that they rise not up again .
let not an ev@@ il speaker be established in the ear@@ th : ev@@ il shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
In@@ cl@@ ine not my heart to any ev@@ il thing , to practi@@ se w@@ ic@@ ked works with men that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : and let me not eat of their da@@ in@@ ties .
let the righ@@ te@@ ous sm@@ ite me ; it shall be a kin@@ d@@ ness : and let him re@@ prove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my pray@@ er also shall be in their cal@@ am@@ ities .
when their judges are over@@ thrown in st@@ ony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are swe@@ et .
keep me from the s@@ nar@@ es which they have laid for me , and the g@@ ins of the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
I cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord with my voice ; with my voice un@@ to the Lord did I make my supp@@ lic@@ ation .
when my spirit was overwhel@@ med within me , then th@@ ou k@@ newest my path . in the way where@@ in I walked have they priv@@ ily laid a sn@@ are for me .
I looked on my right hand , and be@@ held , but there was no man that would know me : ref@@ uge failed me ; no man car@@ ed for my sou@@ l .
bring my sou@@ l out of prison , that I may praise TH@@ Y name : the righ@@ te@@ ous shall comp@@ ass me about ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt deal boun@@ ti@@ fully with me .
for the enemy hat@@ h persec@@ uted my sou@@ l ; he hat@@ h s@@ mit@@ ten my life down to the ground ; he hat@@ h made me to d@@ well in d@@ ark@@ ness , as those that have been long dead .
cause me to hear TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the morning ; for in the@@ e do I trust : cause me to know the way where@@ in I should walk ; for I lift up my sou@@ l un@@ to the@@ e .
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth ; that our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters may be as cor@@ ner stones , pol@@ ished after the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of a palace :

that our ox@@ en may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor going out ; that there be no compla@@ ining in our streets .
happy is that people , that is in such a case : ye@@ a , happy is that people , whose God is the Lord .
the Lord is n@@ igh un@@ to all them that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth .
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
while I live will I praise the Lord : I will sing pra@@ ises un@@ to my God while I have any being .
put not your trust in pr@@ inces , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help .
the Lord open@@ eth the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d : the Lord ra@@ is@@ eth them that are bo@@ wed down : the Lord lov@@ eth the righ@@ te@@ ous :

she is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than ru@@ bies : and all the things th@@ ou can@@ st desire are not to be compared un@@ to her .

when th@@ ou go@@ est , TH@@ Y steps shall not be stra@@ it@@ ened ; and when th@@ ou run@@ n@@ est , th@@ ou s@@ halt not st@@ um@@ ble .

let her be as the lov@@ ing h@@ ind and pleas@@ ant ro@@ e ; let her bre@@ asts satisfy the@@ e at all times ; and be th@@ ou ra@@ vis@@ hed always with her love .
deliver th@@ y@@ self as a ro@@ e from the hand of the hun@@ ter , and as a bird from the hand of the fo@@ w@@ ler .
when th@@ ou go@@ est , it shall lead the@@ e ; when th@@ ou sle@@ ep@@ est , it shall keep the@@ e ; and when th@@ ou aw@@ ak@@ est , it shall talk with the@@ e .

the Pro@@ ver@@ bs of Solomon . a wise son mak@@ eth a glad father : but a fo@@ ol@@ ish son is the heav@@ iness of his mother .
the Lord will not suffer the sou@@ l of the righ@@ te@@ ous to fam@@ ish : but he cas@@ te@@ th away the sub@@ stance of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
he that gather@@ eth in summer is a wise son : but he that sle@@ ep@@ eth in har@@ v@@ est is a son that ca@@ us@@ eth sh@@ ame .

a gr@@ ac@@ ious woman re@@ tain@@ eth honour : and strong men retain ri@@ ches .
they that are of a fro@@ ward heart are ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : but such as are u@@ pri@@ ght in their way are his de@@ light .
though hand join in hand , the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not be un@@ punished : but the se@@ ed of the righ@@ te@@ ous shall be delivered .
there is that sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth , and yet increas@@ eth ; and there is that with@@ hol@@ de@@ th more than is meet , but it ten@@ de@@ th to poverty .

he that troub@@ le@@ th his own house shall inher@@ it the wind : and the fo@@ ol shall be ser@@ vant to the wise of heart .
a vir@@ tu@@ ous woman is a cro@@ wn to her husband : but she that mak@@ eth as@@ ha@@ med is as rot@@ ten@@ ness in his b@@ ones .
the words of the w@@ ic@@ ked are to lie in wait for blood : but the m@@ outh of the u@@ pri@@ ght shall deliver them .
a man shall be commen@@ ded according to his wis@@ dom : but he that is of a per@@ verse heart shall be desp@@ ised .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his m@@ outh : and the re@@ comp@@ ence of a man 's hands shall be ren@@ dered un@@ to him .
good understanding gi@@ vet@@ h favour : but the way of trans@@ gres@@ sors is hard .
a good man le@@ av@@ eth an inher@@ it@@ ance to his children 's children : and the wealth of the sin@@ ner is laid up for the just .
in the m@@ outh of the fo@@ ol@@ ish is a ro@@ d of pride : but the li@@ ps of the wise shall preserve them .
in the multi@@ tude of people is the king 's honour : but in the want of people is the destruction of the pr@@ ince .
he that is slow to wr@@ ath is of great understanding : but he that is has@@ ty of spirit ex@@ al@@ te@@ th Fol@@ ly .
wis@@ dom res@@ te@@ th in the heart of him that hat@@ h understanding : but that which is in the mid@@ st of fo@@ ols is made known .
the way of the slo@@ th@@ ful man is as an h@@ edge of thor@@ ns : but the way of the righ@@ te@@ ous is made pla@@ in .
a man hat@@ h joy by the answer of his m@@ outh : and a word spoken in due season , how good is it !
every one that is proud in heart is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord : though hand join in hand , he shall not be un@@ punished .

he that is slow to an@@ ger is better than the m@@ igh@@ ty ; and he that ru@@ le@@ th his spirit than he that tak@@ eth a city .

even a fo@@ ol , when he hol@@ de@@ th his peace , is counted wise : and he that shut@@ te@@ th his li@@ ps is es@@ te@@ emed a man of understanding .
the words of a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er are as wounds , and they go down into the in@@ ner@@ most parts of the bel@@ ly .
he also that is slo@@ th@@ ful in his work is brother to him that is a great was@@ ter .

a man 's bel@@ ly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his m@@ outh ; and with the increase of his li@@ ps shall he be filled .

they have stric@@ ken me , s@@ halt th@@ ou say , and I was not si@@ ck ; they have beaten me , and I felt it not : when shall I aw@@ ake ? I will seek it yet again .
if th@@ ou say@@ est , be@@ hold , we knew it not ; do@@ th not he that pon@@ der@@ eth the heart consider it ? and he that keep@@ eth TH@@ Y sou@@ l , do@@ th not he know it ? and shall not he ren@@ der to every man according to his works ?
so shall the knowledge of wis@@ dom be un@@ to TH@@ Y sou@@ l : when th@@ ou h@@ ast found it , then there shall be a reward , and TH@@ Y expec@@ tation shall not be cut off .
for there shall be no reward to the ev@@ il man ; the cand@@ le of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be put out .
say not , I will do so to him as he hat@@ h done to me : I will ren@@ der to the man according to his work .
I went by the field of the slo@@ th@@ ful , and by the v@@ ine@@ yard of the man vo@@ id of understanding ;
and , lo , it was all grown over with thor@@ ns , and net@@ t@@ les had covered the face there@@ of , and the stone wall there@@ of was broken down .
it is the gl@@ ory of God to conce@@ al a thing : but the honour of kings is to search out a matter .
for better it is that it be said un@@ to the@@ e , C@@ ome up hi@@ ther ; than that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be put lower in the presence of the pr@@ ince whom th@@ ine eyes have seen .
go not forth has@@ ti@@ ly to strive , lest th@@ ou know not what to do in the end there@@ of , when TH@@ Y neighbour hat@@ h put the@@ e to sh@@ ame .
as the cold of snow in the time of har@@ v@@ est , so is a fa@@ ith@@ ful mes@@ sen@@ ger to them that send him : for he ref@@ res@@ het@@ h the sou@@ l of his mas@@ ters .
H@@ ast th@@ ou found hon@@ ey ? eat so much as is sufficient for the@@ e , lest th@@ ou be filled there@@ with , and v@@ om@@ it it .
if th@@ ine enemy be hun@@ gry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thir@@ st@@ y , give him water to drink :
it is better to d@@ well in the cor@@ ner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than with a bra@@ w@@ ling woman and in a wide house .
he that hat@@ h no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as he that bin@@ de@@ th a stone in a s@@ ling , so is he that gi@@ vet@@ h honour to a fo@@ ol .
he that pass@@ eth by , and med@@ d@@ le@@ th with stri@@ fe belonging not to him , is like one that tak@@ eth a do@@ g by the e@@ ars .
where no wood is , there the fire go@@ eth out : so where there is no tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er , the stri@@ fe ce@@ as@@ eth .
the words of a tale@@ be@@ ar@@ er are as wounds , and they go down into the in@@ ner@@ most parts of the bel@@ ly .
Th@@ ine own friend , and TH@@ Y father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into TH@@ Y brother 's house in the day of TH@@ Y cal@@ am@@ ity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
he that b@@ les@@ set@@ h his friend with a l@@ oud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a cur@@ se to him .
W@@ hos@@ o keep@@ eth the fi@@ g tree shall eat the fruit there@@ of : so he that w@@ ai@@ te@@ th on his master shall be honoured .
though th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest bra@@ y a fo@@ ol in a mort@@ ar among wheat with a p@@ est@@ le , yet will not his fo@@ ol@@ ishness de@@ part from him .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have go@@ ats ' milk enough for TH@@ Y food , for the food of TH@@ Y household , and for the maintenance for TH@@ Y ma@@ i@@ den@@ s .
for the trans@@ gres@@ sion of a land many are the pr@@ inces there@@ of : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state there@@ of shall be prol@@ on@@ ged .
better is the poor that walk@@ eth in his u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , than he that is per@@ verse in his ways , though he be rich .
W@@ hos@@ o ca@@ us@@ eth the righ@@ te@@ ous to go as@@ tra@@ y in an ev@@ il way , he shall fall himself into his own p@@ it : but the u@@ pri@@ ght shall have good things in possession .
he that til@@ le@@ th his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that follow@@ eth after v@@ ain persons shall have poverty enough .
he that has@@ te@@ th to be rich hat@@ h an ev@@ il eye , and consider@@ eth not that poverty shall come upon him .
W@@ hos@@ o rob@@ bet@@ h his father or his mother , and sa@@ ith , It is no trans@@ gres@@ sion ; the same is the compan@@ ion of a destro@@ yer .
he that is of a proud heart s@@ tir@@ re@@ th up stri@@ fe : but he that p@@ ut@@ te@@ th his trust in the Lord shall be made f@@ at .
an un@@ just man is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the just : and he that is u@@ pri@@ ght in the way is ab@@ omin@@ ation to the w@@ ic@@ ked .
L@@ est I be full , and deny the@@ e , and say , Wh@@ o is the Lord ? or lest I be poor , and ste@@ al , and take the name of my God in v@@ ain .
there is a generation , whose te@@ eth are as s@@ words , and their j@@ a@@ w te@@ eth as k@@ ni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from off the ear@@ th , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
the eye that mo@@ c@@ ket@@ h at his father , and desp@@ is@@ eth to obe@@ y his mother , the ra@@ ven@@ s of the val@@ ley shall pick it out , and the young e@@ ag@@ les shall eat it .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ id .
give strong drink un@@ to him that is ready to per@@ ish , and wine un@@ to those that be of heavy hear@@ ts .
the heart of her husband do@@ th saf@@ ely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of sp@@ oil .
she ris@@ eth also while it is yet night , and gi@@ vet@@ h meat to her household , and a portion to her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s .
she stret@@ ch@@ eth out her hand to the poor ; ye@@ a , she reac@@ het@@ h forth her hands to the ne@@ edy .
the wind go@@ eth toward the south , and tur@@ net@@ h about un@@ to the north ; it wh@@ ir@@ le@@ th about continu@@ ally , and the wind retur@@ net@@ h again according to his cir@@ cu@@ its .
all the rivers run into the sea ; yet the sea is not full ; un@@ to the place from wh@@ ence the rivers come , th@@ ither they return again .
the thing that hat@@ h been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of former things ; neither shall there be any re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wis@@ dom concerning all things that are done under heav@@ en : this sor@@ e trav@@ ail hat@@ h God given to the sons of man to be exerc@@ ised there@@ with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , be@@ hold , all is van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
I commun@@ ed with mine own heart , saying , L@@ o , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wis@@ dom than all they that have been before me in Jer@@ usalem : ye@@ a , my heart had great experience of wis@@ dom and knowledge .
I gathered me also silver and gold , and the pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure of kings and of the provinces : I g@@ at me men singers and women singers , and the deli@@ ghts of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sor@@ ts .
then I looked on all the works that my hands had w@@ rought , and on the labour that I had la@@ b@@ oured to do : and , be@@ hold , all was van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
and I turned myself to be@@ hold wis@@ dom , and mad@@ ness , and Fol@@ ly : for what can the man do that co@@ me@@ th after the king ? even that which hat@@ h been already done .
the wise man 's eyes are in his head ; but the fo@@ ol walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness : and I myself perceived also that one event happen@@ eth to them all .
for there is no re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of the wise more than of the fo@@ ol for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how di@@ eth the wise man ? as the fo@@ ol .
Ye@@ a , I ha@@ ted all my labour which I had taken under the sun : because I should leave it un@@ to the man that shall be after me .
and who know@@ eth whether he shall be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour where@@ in I have la@@ b@@ oured , and where@@ in I have she@@ wed myself wise under the sun . this is also van@@ ity .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his sou@@ l enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
I have seen the trav@@ ail , which God hat@@ h given to the sons of men to be exerc@@ ised in it .
he hat@@ h made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hat@@ h set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God mak@@ eth from the beginning to the end .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of God .
and moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess was there ; and the place of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , that in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity was there .
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manif@@ est them , and that they might see that they themselves are be@@ asts .
so I returned , and considered all the op@@ pres@@ sions that are done under the sun : and be@@ hold the te@@ ars of such as were op@@ pressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
Ye@@ a , better is he than both they , which hat@@ h not yet been , who hat@@ h not seen the ev@@ il work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but wo@@ e to him that is alone when he fal@@ le@@ th ; for he hat@@ h not another to help him up .
I considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in his stead .
there is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them : they also that come after shall not re@@ jo@@ ice in him . su@@ rely this also is van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
keep TH@@ Y fo@@ ot when th@@ ou go@@ est to the house of God , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fo@@ ols : for they consider not that they do ev@@ il .
be not ras@@ h with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and let not th@@ ine heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter any thing before God : for God is in heav@@ en , and th@@ ou upon ear@@ th : therefore let TH@@ Y words be few .
for a dream co@@ me@@ th through the multi@@ tude of business ; and a fo@@ ol 's voice is known by multi@@ tude of words .
when th@@ ou vo@@ west a vo@@ w un@@ to God , def@@ er not to pay it ; for he hat@@ h no pleas@@ ure in fo@@ ols : pay that which th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed .
suffer not TH@@ Y m@@ outh to cause TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h to sin ; neither say th@@ ou before the an@@ gel , that it was an er@@ ror : where@@ fore should God be angry at TH@@ Y voice , and destroy the work of th@@ ine hands ?
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners there@@ of , saving the be@@ holding of them with their eyes ?
the sle@@ ep of a la@@ bour@@ ing man is swe@@ et , whether he eat little or much : but the ab@@ und@@ ance of the rich will not suffer him to sle@@ ep .
as he came forth of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nak@@ ed shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
and this also is a sor@@ e ev@@ il , that in all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hat@@ h he that hat@@ h la@@ b@@ oured for the wind ?
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fo@@ ols is in the house of mir@@ th .
it is better to hear the re@@ bu@@ ke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fo@@ ols .
better is the end of a thing than the beginning there@@ of : and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , but in the day of ad@@ versity consider : God also hat@@ h set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
all things have I seen in the days of my van@@ ity : there is a just man that per@@ is@@ het@@ h in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and there is a w@@ ic@@ ked man that prol@@ on@@ get@@ h his life in his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
it is good that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take hold of this ; ye@@ a , also from this withdraw not th@@ ine hand : for he that fear@@ eth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wis@@ dom , and the reason of things , and to know the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Fol@@ ly , even of fo@@ ol@@ ishness and mad@@ ness :
which yet my sou@@ l seek@@ eth , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
who is as the wise man ? and who know@@ eth the interpre@@ tation of a thing ? a man 's wis@@ dom mak@@ eth his face to sh@@ ine , and the bol@@ d@@ ness of his face shall be changed .
all this have I seen , and applied my heart un@@ to every work that is done under the sun : there is a time where@@ in one man ru@@ le@@ th over another to his own hurt .
and so I saw the w@@ ic@@ ked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the hol@@ y , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also van@@ ity .
because sentence against an ev@@ il work is not executed spe@@ edil@@ y , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do ev@@ il .
though a sin@@ ner do ev@@ il an hundred times , and his days be prol@@ on@@ ged , yet su@@ rely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him :
but it shall not be well with the w@@ ic@@ ked , neither shall he prol@@ ong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he fear@@ eth not before God .
there is a van@@ ity which is done upon the ear@@ th ; that there be just men , un@@ to whom it happen@@ eth according to the work of the w@@ ic@@ ked ; again , there be w@@ ic@@ ked men , to whom it happen@@ eth according to the work of the righ@@ te@@ ous : I said that this also is van@@ ity .
when I applied mine heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done upon the ear@@ th : ( for also there is that neither day nor night se@@ eth sle@@ ep with his eyes : )
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
also their love , and their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y , is now per@@ ished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y hand fin@@ de@@ th to do , do it with TH@@ Y might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wis@@ dom , in the grave , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est .
for man also know@@ eth not his time : as the fis@@ hes that are taken in an ev@@ il net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are ; so are the sons of men s@@ nar@@ ed in an ev@@ il time , when it fal@@ le@@ th su@@ d@@ den@@ ly upon them .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , and built great bul@@ war@@ ks against it :
dead f@@ lies cause the o@@ in@@ tment of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ ary to send forth a st@@ in@@ king sav@@ our : so do@@ th a little Fol@@ ly him that is in reputation for wis@@ dom and honour .
Ye@@ a also , when he that is a fo@@ ol walk@@ eth by the way , his wis@@ dom fail@@ eth him , and he sa@@ ith to every one that he is a fo@@ ol .
if the iron be b@@ lun@@ t , and he do not wh@@ et the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wis@@ dom is profitable to direct .
the beginning of the words of his m@@ outh is fo@@ ol@@ ishness : and the end of his talk is mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous mad@@ ness .
a fo@@ ol also is full of words : a man can@@ not tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
b@@ les@@ sed art th@@ ou , O land , when TH@@ Y king is the son of no@@ bles , and TH@@ Y pr@@ inces eat in due season , for strength , and not for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness !
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the ear@@ th : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fal@@ le@@ th , there it shall be .
as th@@ ou know@@ est not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the b@@ ones do grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her that is with child : even so th@@ ou know@@ est not the works of God who mak@@ eth all .
truly the light is swe@@ et , and a pleas@@ ant thing it is for the eyes to be@@ hold the sun :
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of musi@@ ck shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cor@@ d be lo@@ os@@ ed , or the golden bo@@ w@@ l be broken , or the pit@@ cher be broken at the fo@@ un@@ tain , or the whe@@ el broken at the c@@ ister@@ n .
and moreover , because the pre@@ acher was wise , he still ta@@ ught the people knowledge ; ye@@ a , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many Pro@@ ver@@ bs .
the pre@@ acher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was u@@ pri@@ ght , even words of truth .
and further , by these , my son , be ad@@ mon@@ ished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a we@@ ar@@ iness of the f@@ les@@ h .
look not upon me , because I am black , because the sun hat@@ h looked upon me : my mother 's children were angry with me ; they made me the keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards ; but mine own v@@ ine@@ yard have I not kept .
tell me , O th@@ ou whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth , where th@@ ou fe@@ ede@@ st , where th@@ ou mak@@ est TH@@ Y flock to rest at noon : for why should I be as one that tur@@ net@@ h aside by the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y compan@@ ions ?
if th@@ ou know not , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women , go TH@@ Y way forth by the foot@@ steps of the flock , and fe@@ ed TH@@ Y kids bes@@ ide the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ' ten@@ ts .
as the app@@ le tree among the trees of the wood , so is my bel@@ ov@@ ed among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great de@@ light , and his fruit was swe@@ et to my tas@@ te .
I charge you , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem , by the ro@@ es , and by the hin@@ ds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor aw@@ ake my love , ti@@ ll he ple@@ ase .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed is like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t : be@@ hold , he stan@@ de@@ th behind our wall , he lo@@ ok@@ eth forth at the windows , she@@ wing himself through the lat@@ tice .
the flowers appear on the ear@@ th ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the tur@@ tle is heard in our land ;
the fi@@ g tree p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth her green fig@@ s , and the v@@ ines with the tender gra@@ pe give a good s@@ me@@ ll . arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
O my do@@ ve , that art in the cle@@ fts of the rock , in the secret places of the st@@ airs , let me see TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance , let me hear TH@@ Y voice ; for swe@@ et is TH@@ Y voice , and TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance is co@@ mely .
until the day break , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , turn , my bel@@ ov@@ ed , and be th@@ ou like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t upon the mountains of Be@@ ther .
by night on my bed I sought him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
it was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , and into the chamber of her that conce@@ ived me .
I charge you , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem , by the ro@@ es , and by the hin@@ ds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor aw@@ ake my love , ti@@ ll he ple@@ ase .
he made the pil@@ lars there@@ of of silver , the bottom there@@ of of gold , the covering of it of pur@@ ple , the mid@@ st there@@ of being paved with love , for the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem .
go forth , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and be@@ hold king Solomon with the cro@@ wn where@@ with his mother crow@@ ned him in the day of his es@@ po@@ us@@ als , and in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou art fair , my love ; be@@ hold , th@@ ou art fair ; th@@ ou h@@ ast d@@ ov@@ es ' eyes within TH@@ Y loc@@ ks : TH@@ Y ha@@ ir is as a flock of go@@ ats , that appear from mount G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
TH@@ Y te@@ eth are like a flock of she@@ ep that are even shor@@ n , which came up from the w@@ ashing ; where@@ of every one bear tw@@ ins , and none is bar@@ ren among them .
TH@@ Y li@@ ps are like a thre@@ ad of scar@@ let , and TH@@ Y speech is co@@ mely : TH@@ Y temp@@ les are like a piece of a po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate within TH@@ Y loc@@ ks .
until the day break , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , I will get me to the mountain of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , and to the hill of fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
come with me from Lebanon , my sp@@ o@@ use , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of S@@ hen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the li@@ ons ' den@@ s , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart , my sister , my sp@@ o@@ use ; th@@ ou h@@ ast ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart with one of th@@ ine eyes , with one chain of TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
how fair is TH@@ Y love , my sister , my sp@@ o@@ use ! how much better is TH@@ Y love than wine ! and the s@@ me@@ ll of th@@ ine o@@ in@@ tments than all sp@@ ices !
TH@@ Y li@@ ps , O my sp@@ o@@ use , drop as the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b : hon@@ ey and milk are under TH@@ Y ton@@ gue ; and the s@@ me@@ ll of TH@@ Y gar@@ ments is like the s@@ me@@ ll of Lebanon .
I have put off my co@@ at ; how shall I put it on ? I have was@@ hed my feet ; how shall I def@@ ile them ?
I rose up to open to my bel@@ ov@@ ed ; and my hands dropped with m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , and my fin@@ gers with swe@@ et s@@ mel@@ ling m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , upon the hand@@ les of the lock .
I opened to my bel@@ ov@@ ed ; but my bel@@ ov@@ ed had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my sou@@ l failed when he sp@@ ake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
the watch@@ men that went about the city found me , they smo@@ te me , they wounded me ; the ke@@ epers of the walls took away my ve@@ il from me .
what is TH@@ Y bel@@ ov@@ ed more than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women ? what is TH@@ Y bel@@ ov@@ ed more than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , that th@@ ou dost so charge us ?
how beautiful are TH@@ Y feet with sho@@ es , O pr@@ ince 's daughter ! the join@@ ts of TH@@ Y th@@ igh@@ s are like je@@ wel@@ s , the work of the hands of a c@@ un@@ ning work@@ man .
TH@@ Y nec@@ k is as a to@@ wer of Iv@@ ory ; th@@ ine eyes like the fis@@ h@@ po@@ ols in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , by the gate of B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ rab@@ bi@@ m : TH@@ Y n@@ ose is as the to@@ wer of Lebanon which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward Dam@@ as@@ cus .
I said , I will go up to the pal@@ m tree , I will take hold of the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of : now also TH@@ Y bre@@ asts shall be as clu@@ sters of the v@@ ine , and the s@@ me@@ ll of TH@@ Y n@@ ose like app@@ les ;
let us get up early to the v@@ ine@@ yards ; let us see if the v@@ ine flo@@ ur@@ ish , whether the tender gra@@ pe appear , and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates bu@@ d forth : there will I give the@@ e my lov@@ es .
O that th@@ ou w@@ ert as my brother , that suc@@ ked the bre@@ asts of my mother ! when I should find the@@ e without , I would k@@ is@@ s the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I should not be desp@@ ised .
I would lead the@@ e , and bring the@@ e into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me : I would cause the@@ e to drink of sp@@ ic@@ ed wine of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .
who is this that co@@ me@@ th up from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , le@@ an@@ ing upon her bel@@ ov@@ ed ? I raised the@@ e up under the app@@ le tree : there TH@@ Y mother brought the@@ e forth : there she brought the@@ e forth that b@@ are the@@ e .
we have a little sister , and she hat@@ h no bre@@ asts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ?
if she be a wall , we will build upon her a palace of silver : and if she be a door , we will inc@@ lose her with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar .
Solomon had a v@@ ine@@ yard at Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ham@@ on ; he let out the v@@ ine@@ yard un@@ to ke@@ epers ; every one for the fruit there@@ of was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , which he saw concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ h s@@ inf@@ ul nation , a people la@@ den with in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , a se@@ ed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , children that are cor@@ rup@@ ters : they have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel un@@ to an@@ ger , they are gone away back@@ ward .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even un@@ to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it ; but wounds , and bru@@ ises , and p@@ ut@@ rif@@ ying so@@ res : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither m@@ ol@@ lified with o@@ in@@ tment .
your country is de@@ so@@ late , your cities are burned with fire : your land , st@@ ran@@ gers dev@@ our it in your presence , and it is de@@ so@@ late , as over@@ thrown by st@@ ran@@ gers .
and the daughter of Z@@ ion is left as a cot@@ t@@ age in a v@@ ine@@ yard , as a lo@@ dge in a gar@@ den of c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , as a bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed city .
except the Lord of hosts had left un@@ to us a very small re@@ mn@@ ant , we should have been as So@@ dom , and we should have been like un@@ to G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h .
when ye come to appear before me , who hat@@ h required this at your hand , to tre@@ ad my courts ?
bring no more v@@ ain ob@@ lations ; incen@@ se is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to me ; the new mo@@ ons and sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , the calling of assemb@@ lies , I can@@ not away with ; it is in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , even the so@@ lem@@ n meeting .
and when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : ye@@ a , when ye make many pray@@ ers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
was@@ h you , make you clean ; put away the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings from before mine eyes ; ce@@ ase to do ev@@ il ;
TH@@ Y pr@@ inces are rebel@@ li@@ ous , and compan@@ ions of th@@ i@@ ev@@ es : every one lov@@ eth gifts , and follow@@ eth after re@@ wards : they judge not the fa@@ ther@@ less , neither do@@ th the cause of the wi@@ dow come un@@ to them .
and the destruction of the trans@@ gres@@ sors and of the sin@@ ners shall be together , and they that for@@ sake the Lord shall be consu@@ med .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow un@@ to it .
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall re@@ bu@@ ke many people : and they shall beat their s@@ words into p@@ low@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ ing@@ ho@@ oks : nation shall not lift up s@@ word against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots :
their land also is full of id@@ ols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fin@@ gers have made :
enter into the rock , and hide the@@ e in the d@@ ust , for fear of the Lord , and for the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
the lo@@ f@@ ty looks of man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be bo@@ wed down , and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lo@@ f@@ ty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
and they shall go into the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and into the c@@ aves of the ear@@ th , for fear of the Lord , and for the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty , when he ar@@ is@@ eth to shake ter@@ ri@@ bly the ear@@ th .
and the people shall be op@@ pressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall be@@ have himself pro@@ u@@ dly against the ancient , and the base against the honour@@ able .
say ye to the righ@@ te@@ ous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their do@@ ings .
moreover the Lord sa@@ ith , Bec@@ ause the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion are ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and walk with stret@@ ched forth nec@@ ks and wan@@ ton eyes , walk@@ ing and min@@ cing as they go , and making a tin@@ k@@ ling with their feet :
therefore the Lord will sm@@ ite with a sc@@ a@@ b the cro@@ wn of the head of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and the Lord will discover their secret parts .
and it shall come to pass , that instead of swe@@ et s@@ me@@ ll there shall be st@@ ink ; and instead of a gir@@ dle a rent ; and instead of well set ha@@ ir bal@@ d@@ ness ; and instead of a st@@ om@@ acher a gir@@ ding of s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th ; and burning instead of beauty .
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man , saying , We will eat our own bread , and wear our own appar@@ el : only let us be called by TH@@ Y name , to take away our re@@ pro@@ ach .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Z@@ ion , and he that remain@@ eth in Jer@@ usalem , shall be called hol@@ y , even every one that is written among the living in Jer@@ usalem :
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from the mid@@ st there@@ of by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
and the Lord will create upon every d@@ wel@@ ling place of mount Z@@ ion , and upon her assemb@@ lies , a cl@@ oud and smoke by day , and the sh@@ ining of a f@@ laming fire by night : for upon all the gl@@ ory shall be a defence .
and there shall be a tab@@ ern@@ acle for a shadow in the day@@ time from the heat , and for a place of ref@@ uge , and for a cover@@ t from storm and from rain .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? where@@ fore , when I looked that it should bring forth grap@@ es , brought it forth wild grap@@ es ?
and now go to ; I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard : I will take away the h@@ edge there@@ of , and it shall be e@@ aten up ; and break down the wall there@@ of , and it shall be tro@@ dden down :
and I will lay it waste : it shall not be pr@@ un@@ ed , nor dig@@ ged ; but there shall come up bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : I will also command the cl@@ ou@@ ds that they rain no rain upon it .
for the v@@ ine@@ yard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel , and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h his pleas@@ ant plant : and he looked for judgment , but be@@ hold op@@ pression ; for righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , but be@@ hold a cry .
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that join house to house , that lay field to field , ti@@ ll there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th !
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , ti@@ ll wine inf@@ la@@ me them !
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pip@@ e , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
therefore my people are gone into cap@@ tivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honour@@ able men are fam@@ ished , and their multi@@ tude dri@@ ed up with thir@@ st .
therefore hell hat@@ h en@@ lar@@ ged her@@ self , and opened her m@@ outh without measure : and their gl@@ ory , and their multi@@ tude , and their pom@@ p , and he that re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth , shall des@@ cen@@ d into it .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the m@@ igh@@ ty man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the eyes of the lo@@ f@@ ty shall be hum@@ b@@ led :
that say , Let him make speed , and has@@ ten his work , that we may see it : and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw n@@ igh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will his@@ s un@@ to them from the end of the ear@@ th : and , be@@ hold , they shall come with speed swi@@ f@@ tly :
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the gir@@ dle of their lo@@ ins be lo@@ os@@ ed , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
whose ar@@ ro@@ ws are sharp , and all their bo@@ ws b@@ ent , their hor@@ ses ' ho@@ of@@ s shall be counted like F@@ lin@@ t , and their whe@@ els like a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind :
their ro@@ aring shall be like a lion , they shall ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons : ye@@ a , they shall ro@@ ar , and lay hold of the pre@@ y , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and in that day they shall ro@@ ar against them like the ro@@ aring of the sea : and if one look un@@ to the land , be@@ hold d@@ ark@@ ness and sor@@ row , and the light is dar@@ ken@@ ed in the heav@@ ens there@@ of .
in the year that king Uz@@ zi@@ ah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a th@@ r@@ one , high and lifted up , and his train filled the temp@@ le .
above it stood the ser@@ ap@@ h@@ ims : each one had six w@@ ings ; with tw@@ ain he covered his face , and with tw@@ ain he covered his feet , and with tw@@ ain he did fly .
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cri@@ ed , and the house was filled with smoke .
then fle@@ w one of the ser@@ ap@@ h@@ ims un@@ to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the ton@@ gs from off the alt@@ ar :
make the heart of this people f@@ at , and make their e@@ ars heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and understand with their heart , and conver@@ t , and be he@@ aled .
and the Lord have removed men far away , and there be a great for@@ sak@@ ing in the mid@@ st of the land .
and it came to pass in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up toward Jer@@ usalem to war against it , but could not prev@@ ail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is conf@@ eder@@ ate with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
then said the Lord un@@ to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , G@@ o forth now to meet A@@ haz , th@@ ou , and She@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ash@@ u@@ b TH@@ Y son , at the end of the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field ;
and say un@@ to him , T@@ ake heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted for the two ta@@ ils of these smoking fire@@ brands , for the fierce an@@ ger of Re@@ z@@ in with Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
let us go up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and ve@@ x it , and let us make a breach there@@ in for us , and set a king in the mid@@ st of it , even the son of T@@ ab@@ e@@ al :
the Lord shall bring upon the@@ e , and upon TH@@ Y people , and upon TH@@ Y father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im depar@@ ted from Ju@@ da@@ h ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall his@@ s for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the de@@ so@@ late val@@ ley@@ s , and in the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and upon all thor@@ ns , and upon all bus@@ hes .
in the same day shall the Lord s@@ have with a ras@@ or that is hired , name@@ ly , by them beyond the river , by the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head , and the ha@@ ir of the feet : and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall no@@ ur@@ ish a young cow , and two she@@ ep ;
and it shall come to pass , for the ab@@ und@@ ance of milk that they shall give he shall eat but@@ ter : for but@@ ter and hon@@ ey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
and on all hil@@ ls that shall be dig@@ ged with the mat@@ to@@ ck , there shall not come th@@ ither the fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of les@@ ser c@@ attle .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the ri@@ ches of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the sp@@ oil of Samar@@ ia shall be taken away before the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
for the Lord sp@@ ake thus to me with a strong hand , and instruc@@ ted me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
say ye not , A conf@@ eder@@ acy , to all them to whom this people shall say , A conf@@ eder@@ acy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be afraid .
and he shall be for a sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of off@@ ence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a sn@@ are to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem .
and I will wait upon the Lord , that hi@@ de@@ th his face from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and I will look for him .
be@@ hold , I and the children whom the Lord hat@@ h given me are for signs and for won@@ ders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in mount Z@@ ion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bes@@ te@@ ad and hun@@ gry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hun@@ gry , they shall fre@@ t themselves , and cur@@ se their king and their God , and look up@@ ward .
the people that walked in d@@ ark@@ ness have seen a great light : they that d@@ well in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hat@@ h the light sh@@ ined .
for every battle of the war@@ ri@@ or is with conf@@ used no@@ ise , and gar@@ ments rol@@ led in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
for un@@ to us a child is born , un@@ to us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his sho@@ ul@@ der : and his name shall be called W@@ on@@ der@@ ful , Coun@@ seller , The m@@ igh@@ ty God , The ever@@ lasting F@@ ather , The Prince of Peace .
for w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess bur@@ net@@ h as the fire : it shall dev@@ our the bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns , and shall kin@@ dle in the th@@ ic@@ kets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
through the wr@@ ath of the Lord of hosts is the land dar@@ ken@@ ed , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spar@@ e his brother .
and he shall sn@@ at@@ ch on the right hand , and be hun@@ gry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the f@@ les@@ h of his own arm :
Wo@@ e un@@ to them that decree un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous decre@@ es , and that write gri@@ ev@@ ous@@ ness which they have pres@@ cri@@ bed ;
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your gl@@ ory ?
without me they shall bo@@ w down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the sla@@ in . for all this his an@@ ger is not turned away , but his hand is stret@@ ched out still .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it he mean@@ eth not so , neither do@@ th his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
as my hand hat@@ h found the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the id@@ ols , and whose Gra@@ ven images did exc@@ el them of Jer@@ usalem and of Samar@@ ia ;
shall the ax@@ e bo@@ ast itself against him that he@@ w@@ eth there@@ with ? or shall the saw mag@@ ni@@ fy itself against him that shak@@ eth it ? as if the ro@@ d should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his f@@ at ones le@@ ann@@ ess ; and under his gl@@ ory he shall kin@@ dle a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a fla@@ me : and it shall bur@@ n and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day ;
and shall consum@@ e the gl@@ ory of his forest , and of his fruit@@ ful field , both sou@@ l and body : and they shall be as when a standard@@ be@@ ar@@ er fa@@ in@@ te@@ th .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel , and such as are escaped of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , shall no more again stay upon him that smo@@ te them ; but shall stay upon the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting .
as yet shall he remain at No@@ b that day : he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Z@@ ion , the hill of Jer@@ usalem .
be@@ hold , the Lord , the Lord of hosts , shall lo@@ p the b@@ ough with terror : and the high ones of stat@@ ure shall be he@@ wn down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty shall be hum@@ b@@ led .
and there shall come forth a ro@@ d out of the stem of J@@ es@@ se , and a Bran@@ ch shall grow out of his roots :
and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wis@@ dom and understanding , the spirit of coun@@ sel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord ;
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither re@@ prove after the hearing of his e@@ ars :
but with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall he judge the poor , and re@@ prove with equ@@ ity for the me@@ ek of the ear@@ th : and he shall sm@@ ite the ear@@ th with the ro@@ d of his m@@ outh , and with the bre@@ ath of his li@@ ps shall he s@@ lay the w@@ ic@@ ked .
and the cow and the bear shall fe@@ ed ; their young ones shall lie down together : and the lion shall eat stra@@ w like the o@@ x .
and the suc@@ king child shall play on the hol@@ e of the as@@ p , and the we@@ an@@ ed child shall put his hand on the co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ce ' den .
and in that day there shall be a root of J@@ es@@ se , which shall stand for an en@@ sign of the people ; to it shall the Gen@@ ti@@ les seek : and his rest shall be g@@ lor@@ ious .
and he shall set up an en@@ sign for the nations , and shall assem@@ ble the out@@ casts of Israel , and gather together the disper@@ sed of Ju@@ da@@ h from the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th .
the en@@ v@@ y also of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall de@@ part , and the ad@@ vers@@ aries of Ju@@ da@@ h shall be cut off : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall not en@@ v@@ y Ju@@ da@@ h , and Ju@@ da@@ h shall not ve@@ x E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
but they shall fly upon the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall sp@@ oil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obe@@ y them .
be@@ hold , God is my sal@@ vation ; I will trust , and not be afraid : for the Lord J@@ eh@@ ov@@ ah is my strength and my song ; he also is become my sal@@ vation .
lift ye up a ban@@ ner upon the high mountain , ex@@ alt the voice un@@ to them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the no@@ bles .
I have comman@@ ded my sanc@@ ti@@ fied ones , I have also called my m@@ igh@@ ty ones for mine an@@ ger , even them that re@@ jo@@ ice in my high@@ ness .
they come from a far country , from the end of heav@@ en , even the Lord , and the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation , to destroy the whole land .
and they shall be afraid : pan@@ gs and sor@@ ro@@ ws shall take hold of them ; they shall be in p@@ ain as a woman that trav@@ ail@@ eth : they shall be amaz@@ ed one at another ; their faces shall be as fla@@ mes .
be@@ hold , the day of the Lord co@@ me@@ th , cru@@ el both with wr@@ ath and fierce an@@ ger , to lay the land de@@ so@@ late : and he shall destroy the sin@@ ners there@@ of out of it .
for the stars of heav@@ en and the con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations there@@ of shall not give their light : the sun shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to sh@@ ine .
and I will punish the world for their ev@@ il , and the w@@ ic@@ ked for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will cause the ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy of the proud to ce@@ ase , and will lay low the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
I will make a man more pre@@ ci@@ ous than fine gold ; even a man than the golden w@@ edge of Op@@ hir .
therefore I will shake the heav@@ ens , and the ear@@ th shall remove out of her place , in the wr@@ ath of the Lord of hosts , and in the day of his fierce an@@ ger .
and it shall be as the ch@@ ased ro@@ e , and as a she@@ ep that no man tak@@ eth up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
every one that is found shall be th@@ rust through ; and every one that is joined un@@ to them shall fall by the s@@ word .
their children also shall be d@@ ashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be sp@@ o@@ iled , and their wi@@ ves ra@@ vis@@ hed .
be@@ hold , I will stir up the Me@@ des against them , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not de@@ light in it .
their bo@@ ws also shall d@@ ash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b ; their eye shall not spar@@ e children .
it shall never be inhabited , neither shall it be d@@ wel@@ t in from generation to generation : neither shall the Ara@@ bi@@ an pit@@ ch tent there ; neither shall the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds make their fold there .
and the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall cry in their de@@ so@@ late houses , and dra@@ g@@ ons in their pleas@@ ant pal@@ aces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prol@@ on@@ ged .
for the Lord will have mer@@ cy on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the st@@ ran@@ gers shall be joined with them , and they shall cle@@ ave to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give the@@ e rest from TH@@ Y sor@@ row , and from TH@@ Y fear , and from the hard bon@@ da@@ ge where@@ in th@@ ou w@@ ast made to serve ,
he who smo@@ te the people in wr@@ ath with a contin@@ ual stro@@ ke , he that ruled the nations in an@@ ger , is persec@@ uted , and none hin@@ der@@ eth .
TH@@ Y pom@@ p is brought down to the grave , and the no@@ ise of TH@@ Y viol@@ s : the wor@@ m is spread under the@@ e , and the wor@@ ms cover the@@ e .
all the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in gl@@ ory , every one in his own house .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not be joined with them in bur@@ ial , because th@@ ou h@@ ast destroyed TH@@ Y land , and sla@@ in TH@@ Y people : the se@@ ed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers shall never be renowned .
prepare sla@@ ughter for his children for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of their fa@@ thers ; that they do not rise , nor poss@@ ess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
I will also make it a possession for the bit@@ tern , and po@@ ols of water : and I will swe@@ ep it with the bes@@ om of destruction , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sworn , saying , su@@ rely as I have thought , so shall it come to pass ; and as I have pur@@ posed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and upon my mountains tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot : then shall his yok@@ e de@@ part from off them , and his burden de@@ part from off their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
this is the purpose that is pur@@ posed upon the whole ear@@ th : and this is the hand that is stret@@ ched out upon all the nations .
re@@ jo@@ ice not th@@ ou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the ro@@ d of him that smo@@ te the@@ e is broken : for out of the ser@@ p@@ ent 's root shall come forth a co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ce , and his fruit shall be a fi@@ ery flying ser@@ p@@ ent .
and the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor shall fe@@ ed , and the ne@@ edy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill TH@@ Y root with fam@@ ine , and he shall s@@ lay TH@@ Y re@@ mn@@ ant .
the burden of Mo@@ a@@ b . because in the night A@@ r of Mo@@ a@@ b is laid waste , and brought to sil@@ ence ; because in the night K@@ ir of Mo@@ a@@ b is laid waste , and brought to sil@@ ence ;
he is gone up to Baj@@ ith , and to Di@@ bon , the high places , to we@@ ep : Mo@@ a@@ b shall ho@@ w@@ l over N@@ eb@@ o , and over M@@ ede@@ ba : on all their heads shall be bal@@ d@@ ness , and every be@@ ard cut off .
in their streets they shall gir@@ d themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : on the tops of their houses , and in their streets , every one shall ho@@ w@@ l , we@@ eping ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly .
and H@@ es@@ h@@ bon shall cry , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : their voice shall be heard even un@@ to Ja@@ haz : therefore the armed soldiers of Mo@@ a@@ b shall cry out ; his life shall be gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ to him .
my heart shall cry out for Mo@@ a@@ b ; his fugitives shall flee un@@ to Zo@@ ar , an he@@ if@@ er of three years old : for by the mounting up of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping shall they go it up ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
therefore the ab@@ und@@ ance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the Bro@@ ok of the w@@ il@@ lows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Mo@@ a@@ b ; the ho@@ w@@ ling there@@ of un@@ to Eg@@ la@@ im , and the ho@@ w@@ ling there@@ of un@@ to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ el@@ im .
send ye the lam@@ b to the ru@@ ler of the land from Sel@@ a to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , un@@ to the mount of the daughter of Z@@ ion .
for it shall be , that , as a w@@ and@@ ering bird cast out of the n@@ est , so the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Mo@@ a@@ b shall be at the for@@ ds of Ar@@ non .
and in mer@@ cy shall the th@@ r@@ one be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David , jud@@ ging , and seeking judgment , and has@@ ting righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b ; he is very proud : even of his ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess , and his pride , and his wr@@ ath : but his lies shall not be so .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Mo@@ a@@ b is we@@ ary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanc@@ tu@@ ary to pra@@ y ; but he shall not prev@@ ail .
the cities of A@@ ro@@ er are for@@ sak@@ en : they shall be for f@@ loc@@ ks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress also shall ce@@ ase from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the k@@ ing@@ dom from Dam@@ as@@ cus , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Syria : they shall be as the gl@@ ory of the children of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the gl@@ ory of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be made th@@ in , and the fat@@ ness of his f@@ les@@ h shall wa@@ x le@@ an .
and it shall be as when the har@@ v@@ est@@ man gather@@ eth the cor@@ n , and re@@ ap@@ eth the e@@ ars with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gather@@ eth e@@ ars in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
at that day shall a man look to his Mak@@ er , and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel .
and he shall not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fin@@ gers have made , either the gro@@ ves , or the images .
in the day s@@ halt th@@ ou make TH@@ Y plant to grow , and in the morning s@@ halt th@@ ou make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to flo@@ ur@@ ish : but the har@@ v@@ est shall be a he@@ ap in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
Wo@@ e to the multi@@ tude of many people , which make a no@@ ise like the no@@ ise of the seas ; and to the rus@@ hing of nations , that make a rus@@ hing like the rus@@ hing of m@@ igh@@ ty waters !
the nations shall rush like the rus@@ hing of many waters : but God shall re@@ bu@@ ke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be ch@@ ased as the c@@ haf@@ f of the mountains before the wind , and like a rol@@ ling thing before the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind .
and be@@ hold at even@@ ing@@ ti@@ de trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that sp@@ oil us , and the lot of them that ro@@ b us .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and d@@ wel@@ lers on the ear@@ th , see ye , when he lif@@ te@@ th up an en@@ sign on the mountains ; and when he b@@ low@@ eth a tr@@ ump@@ et , hear ye .
for a@@ fore the har@@ v@@ est , when the bu@@ d is perfect , and the s@@ our gra@@ pe is ri@@ pen@@ ing in the f@@ lower , he shall both cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and take away and cut down the branches .
they shall be left together un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the mountains , and to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th : and the fo@@ w@@ ls shall summer upon them , and all the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th shall winter upon them .
the burden of Egypt . be@@ hold , the Lord ri@@ de@@ th upon a swift cl@@ oud , and shall come into Egypt : and the id@@ ols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall mel@@ t in the mid@@ st of it .
and I will set the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans against the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom .
and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the mid@@ st there@@ of ; and I will destroy the coun@@ sel there@@ of : and they shall seek to the id@@ ols , and to the char@@ mers , and to them that have familiar spir@@ its , and to the w@@ iz@@ ards .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be was@@ ted and dri@@ ed up .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the bro@@ oks of defence shall be emp@@ tied and dri@@ ed up : the re@@ eds and flags shall wi@@ ther .
the paper re@@ eds by the bro@@ oks , by the m@@ outh of the bro@@ oks , and every thing so@@ wn by the bro@@ oks , shall wi@@ ther , be driven away , and be no more .
the fis@@ hers also shall mour@@ n , and all they that cast an@@ gle into the bro@@ oks shall la@@ ment , and they that spread n@@ ets upon the waters shall langu@@ ish .
and they shall be broken in the purposes there@@ of , all that make s@@ lu@@ ices and pon@@ ds for fish .
the pr@@ inces of Zo@@ an are become fo@@ ols , the pr@@ inces of N@@ op@@ h are dec@@ e@@ ived ; they have also s@@ educ@@ ed Egypt , even they that are the stay of the tri@@ bes there@@ of .
the Lord hat@@ h min@@ g@@ led a per@@ verse spirit in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and they have caused Egypt to er@@ r in every work there@@ of , as a dr@@ un@@ ken man stag@@ ger@@ eth in his v@@ om@@ it .
in that day shall Egypt be like un@@ to women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shak@@ eth over it .
and the land of Ju@@ da@@ h shall be a terror un@@ to Egypt , every one that mak@@ eth mention there@@ of shall be afraid in himself , because of the coun@@ sel of the Lord of hosts , which he hat@@ h determined against it .
in that day shall there be an alt@@ ar to the Lord in the mid@@ st of the land of Egypt , and a pil@@ lar at the border there@@ of to the Lord .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and perform it .
and the Lord shall sm@@ ite Egypt : he shall sm@@ ite and he@@ al it : and they shall return even to the Lord , and he shall be in@@ treated of them , and shall he@@ al them .
in that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall serve with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans .
so shall the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a lead away the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans prisoners , and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians cap@@ tives , young and old , nak@@ ed and bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot , even with their but@@ to@@ cks uncovered , to the sh@@ ame of Egypt .
therefore are my lo@@ ins filled with p@@ ain : pan@@ gs have taken hold upon me , as the pan@@ gs of a woman that trav@@ ail@@ eth : I was bo@@ wed down at the hearing of it ; I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the seeing of it .
O my th@@ res@@ hing , and the cor@@ n of my floor : that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared un@@ to you .
for they fled from the s@@ words , from the drawn s@@ word , and from the b@@ ent bo@@ w , and from the gri@@ ev@@ ous@@ ness of war .
for thus hat@@ h the Lord said un@@ to me , With@@ in a year , according to the years of an hi@@ re@@ ling , and all the gl@@ ory of K@@ ed@@ ar shall fail :
all TH@@ Y rul@@ ers are fled together , they are bound by the ar@@ chers : all that are found in the@@ e are bound together , which have fled from far .
and it shall come to pass , that TH@@ Y cho@@ ic@@ est val@@ ley@@ s shall be full of char@@ i@@ ots , and the hor@@ se@@ men shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and he discovered the covering of Ju@@ da@@ h , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st look in that day to the arm@@ our of the house of the forest .
Y@@ e have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and ye have num@@ ber@@ ed the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses have ye broken down to for@@ ti@@ fy the wall .
Y@@ e made also a di@@ t@@ ch between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not looked un@@ to the maker there@@ of , neither had respect un@@ to him that fas@@ hi@@ oned it long ago .
what h@@ ast th@@ ou here ? and whom h@@ ast th@@ ou here , that th@@ ou h@@ ast he@@ wed the@@ e out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re here , as he that he@@ w@@ eth him out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on high , and that gra@@ vet@@ h an habi@@ tation for himself in a rock ?
he will su@@ rely viol@@ ently turn and Tos@@ s the@@ e like a ball into a large country : there s@@ halt th@@ ou die , and there the char@@ i@@ ots of TH@@ Y gl@@ ory shall be the sh@@ ame of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house .
and I will drive the@@ e from TH@@ Y station , and from TH@@ Y state shall he pull the@@ e down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will call my ser@@ vant Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah :
and I will clo@@ the him with TH@@ Y ro@@ be , and strengthen him with TH@@ Y gir@@ dle , and I will commit TH@@ Y government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his sho@@ ul@@ der ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and I will fas@@ ten him as a na@@ il in a sure place ; and he shall be for a g@@ lor@@ ious th@@ r@@ one to his father 's house .
and they shall han@@ g upon him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , all vessels of small quanti@@ ty , from the vessels of c@@ ups , even to all the vessels of fla@@ g@@ ons .
the burden of T@@ y@@ re . H@@ ow@@ l , ye ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish ; for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in : from the land of Ch@@ it@@ tim it is revealed to them .
be still , ye inhabitants of the is@@ le ; th@@ ou whom the mer@@ chan@@ ts of Z@@ id@@ on , that pass over the sea , have rep@@ len@@ ished .
he stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , he sho@@ ok the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms : the Lord hat@@ h given a comman@@ d@@ ment against the mer@@ chan@@ t city , to destroy the strong holds there@@ of .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that T@@ y@@ re shall be forgotten sev@@ enty years , according to the days of one king : after the end of sev@@ enty years shall T@@ y@@ re sing as an har@@ lot .
and it shall come to pass after the end of sev@@ enty years , that the Lord will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall turn to her h@@ ire , and shall commit for@@ nic@@ ation with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world upon the face of the ear@@ th .
when thus it shall be in the mid@@ st of the land among the people , there shall be as the shak@@ ing of an olive tree , and as the g@@ le@@ an@@ ing grap@@ es when the vin@@ t@@ age is done .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fle@@ eth from the no@@ ise of the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he that co@@ me@@ th up out of the mid@@ st of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the ear@@ th do shake .
the ear@@ th shall reel to and f@@ ro like a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d , and shall be removed like a cot@@ t@@ age ; and the trans@@ gres@@ sion there@@ of shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th upon the ear@@ th .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
O Lord , th@@ ou art my God ; I will ex@@ alt the@@ e , I will praise TH@@ Y name ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast done won@@ der@@ ful things ; TH@@ Y coun@@ sels of old are fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and truth .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers , as the heat in a d@@ ry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cl@@ oud : the branch of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make un@@ to all people a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of win@@ es on the le@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of win@@ es on the le@@ es well refin@@ ed .
he will sw@@ allow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces ; and the re@@ bu@@ ke of his people shall he take away from off all the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and it shall be said in that day , L@@ o , this is our God ; we have w@@ aited for him , and he will save us : this is the Lord ; we have w@@ aited for him , we will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in his sal@@ vation .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest , and Mo@@ a@@ b shall be tro@@ dden down under him , even as stra@@ w is tro@@ dden down for the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the mid@@ st of them , as he that swim@@ me@@ th sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th forth his hands to sw@@ im : and he shall bring down their pride together with the sp@@ o@@ ils of their hands .
and the fortress of the high For@@ t of TH@@ Y walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the d@@ ust .
for he br@@ ing@@ eth down them that d@@ well on high ; the lo@@ f@@ ty city , he lay@@ eth it low ; he lay@@ eth it low , even to the ground ; he br@@ ing@@ eth it even to the d@@ ust .
Ye@@ a , in the way of TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , O Lord , have we w@@ aited for the@@ e ; the desire of our sou@@ l is to TH@@ Y name , and to the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of the@@ e .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red the@@ e in the night ; ye@@ a , with my spirit within me will I seek the@@ e early : for when TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world will learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let favour be she@@ wed to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet will he not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness will he deal un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly , and will not be@@ hold the maj@@ es@@ ty of the Lord .
Lord , when TH@@ Y hand is lifted up , they will not see : but they shall see , and be as@@ ha@@ med for their en@@ v@@ y at the people ; ye@@ a , the fire of th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dev@@ our them .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are dec@@ eased , they shall not rise : therefore h@@ ast th@@ ou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to per@@ ish .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast increased the nation , O Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast increased the nation : th@@ ou art gl@@ ori@@ fied : th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st removed it far un@@ to all the ends of the ear@@ th .
like as a woman with child , that dra@@ w@@ eth near the time of her delivery , is in p@@ ain , and cri@@ eth out in her pan@@ gs ; so have we been in TH@@ Y sight , O Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in p@@ ain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not w@@ rought any deliver@@ ance in the ear@@ th ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter th@@ ou into TH@@ Y ch@@ ambers , and shut TH@@ Y doors about the@@ e : hide th@@ y@@ self as it were for a little moment , until the in@@ dign@@ ation be over@@ past .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord co@@ me@@ th out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the ear@@ th for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : the ear@@ th also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her sla@@ in .
he shall cause them that come of Jac@@ o@@ b to take root : Israel shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m and bu@@ d , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
yet the def@@ enced city shall be de@@ so@@ late , and the habi@@ tation for@@ sak@@ en , and left like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : there shall the cal@@ f fe@@ ed , and there shall he lie down , and consum@@ e the branches there@@ of .
when the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of are with@@ ered , they shall be broken off : the women come , and set them on fire : for it is a people of no understanding : therefore he that made them will not have mer@@ cy on them , and he that formed them will she@@ w them no favour .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall beat off from the channel of the river un@@ to the stream of Egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , O ye children of Israel .
Wo@@ e to the cro@@ wn of pride , to the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , whose g@@ lor@@ ious beauty is a f@@ ading f@@ lower , which are on the head of the f@@ at val@@ ley@@ s of them that are overcome with wine !
be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h a m@@ igh@@ ty and strong one , which as a temp@@ est of ha@@ il and a destroying storm , as a flood of m@@ igh@@ ty waters over@@ flow@@ ing , shall cast down to the ear@@ th with the hand .
in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory , and for a di@@ ade@@ m of beauty , un@@ to the resi@@ due of his people ,
judgment also will I lay to the line , and righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness to the pl@@ um@@ met : and the ha@@ il shall swe@@ ep away the ref@@ uge of lies , and the waters shall over@@ flow the hiding place .
and your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with death shall be dis@@ annulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the over@@ flow@@ ing s@@ cour@@ ge shall pass through , then ye shall be tro@@ dden down by it .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narro@@ wer than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the Lord shall rise up as in mount Per@@ az@@ im , he shall be wro@@ th as in the val@@ ley of Gi@@ be@@ on , that he may do his work , his st@@ range work ; and bring to pass his act , his st@@ range act .
when he hat@@ h made pla@@ in the face there@@ of , do@@ th he not cast abroad the f@@ it@@ ches , and sc@@ at@@ ter the cum@@ min , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed bar@@ ley and ri@@ e in their place ?
for the f@@ it@@ ches are not th@@ res@@ hed with a th@@ res@@ hing instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned about upon the cum@@ min ; but the f@@ it@@ ches are beaten out with a staff , and the cum@@ min with a ro@@ d .
bread cor@@ n is bru@@ ised ; because he will not ever be th@@ res@@ hing it , nor break it with the whe@@ el of his c@@ art , nor bru@@ ise it with his hor@@ se@@ men .
and I will camp against the@@ e round about , and will lay siege against the@@ e with a mount , and I will raise for@@ ts against the@@ e .
moreover the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ gers shall be like small d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be as c@@ haf@@ f that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an in@@ stan@@ t su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
for the Lord hat@@ h p@@ oured out upon you the spirit of deep sle@@ ep , and hat@@ h closed your eyes : the pro@@ ph@@ ets and your rul@@ ers , the se@@ ers hat@@ h he covered .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord said , For@@ as@@ much as this people draw near me with their m@@ outh , and with their li@@ ps do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is ta@@ ught by the prec@@ ep@@ t of men :
therefore , be@@ hold , I will proceed to do a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous work among this people , even a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous work and a wonder : for the wis@@ dom of their wise men shall per@@ ish , and the understanding of their pru@@ dent men shall be hi@@ d .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field shall be es@@ te@@ emed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the de@@ af hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d shall see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity , and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
the me@@ ek also shall increase their joy in the Lord , and the poor among men shall re@@ jo@@ ice in the Holy One of Israel .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and shall fear the God of Israel .
that walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked at my m@@ outh ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
therefore this in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , s@@ wel@@ ling out in a high wall , whose breaking co@@ me@@ th su@@ d@@ den@@ ly at an in@@ stan@@ t .
one thousand shall flee at the re@@ bu@@ ke of one ; at the re@@ bu@@ ke of five shall ye flee : ti@@ ll ye be left as a be@@ ac@@ on upon the top of a mountain , and as an en@@ sign on an hill .
for the people shall d@@ well in Z@@ ion at Jer@@ usalem : th@@ ou s@@ halt we@@ ep no more : he will be very gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to the@@ e at the voice of TH@@ Y cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer the@@ e .
and though the Lord give you the bread of ad@@ versity , and the water of aff@@ li@@ ction , yet shall not TH@@ Y teachers be removed into a cor@@ ner any more , but th@@ ine eyes shall see TH@@ Y teachers :
and th@@ ine e@@ ars shall hear a word behind the@@ e , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Y@@ e shall def@@ ile also the covering of TH@@ Y Gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of TH@@ Y m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold : th@@ ou s@@ halt cast them away as a men@@ stru@@ ous clo@@ th ; th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to it , G@@ et the@@ e hence .
then shall he give the rain of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , that th@@ ou s@@ halt so@@ w the ground with@@ al ; and bread of the increase of the ear@@ th , and it shall be f@@ at and plen@@ te@@ ous : in that day shall TH@@ Y c@@ attle fe@@ ed in large pas@@ tures .
the ox@@ en likewise and the young ass@@ es that e@@ ar the ground shall eat clean pro@@ ven@@ der , which hat@@ h been win@@ no@@ wed with the sh@@ ov@@ el and with the fan .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and stre@@ ams of waters in the day of the great sla@@ ughter , when the tow@@ ers fall .
be@@ hold , the name of the Lord co@@ me@@ th from far , burning with his an@@ ger , and the burden there@@ of is heavy : his li@@ ps are full of in@@ dign@@ ation , and his ton@@ gue as a dev@@ our@@ ing fire :
and his bre@@ ath , as an over@@ flow@@ ing stream , shall reach to the mid@@ st of the nec@@ k , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of van@@ ity : and there shall be a bri@@ dle in the j@@ a@@ ws of the people , causing them to er@@ r .
Y@@ e shall have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y so@@ lem@@ n@@ ity is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one go@@ eth with a pip@@ e to come into the mountain of the Lord , to the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Israel .
and the Lord shall cause his g@@ lor@@ ious voice to be heard , and shall she@@ w the ligh@@ ting down of his arm , with the in@@ dign@@ ation of his an@@ ger , and with the fla@@ me of a dev@@ our@@ ing fire , with sc@@ at@@ tering , and temp@@ est , and ha@@ il@@ stones .
and in every place where the gro@@ unded staff shall pass , which the Lord shall lay upon him , it shall be with tab@@ re@@ ts and har@@ ps : and in batt@@ les of shak@@ ing will he fight with it .
Wo@@ e to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on hor@@ ses , and trust in char@@ i@@ ots , because they are many ; and in hor@@ se@@ men , because they are very strong ; but they look not un@@ to the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the Lord !
yet he also is wise , and will bring ev@@ il , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of them that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
now the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans are men , and not God ; and their hor@@ ses f@@ les@@ h , and not spirit . when the Lord shall stretch out his hand , both he that hel@@ pet@@ h shall fall , and he that is hol@@ p@@ en shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
for in that day every man shall cast away his id@@ ols of silver , and his id@@ ols of gold , which your own hands have made un@@ to you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a cover@@ t from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a d@@ ry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a we@@ ary land .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the e@@ ars of them that hear shall he@@ arken .
the heart also of the ras@@ h shall understand knowledge , and the ton@@ gue of the st@@ ammer@@ ers shall be ready to speak pla@@ in@@ ly .
Tre@@ m@@ ble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye car@@ ele@@ ss ones : stri@@ p you , and make you b@@ are , and gir@@ d s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th upon your lo@@ ins .
and the people shall be as the bur@@ nings of li@@ me : as thor@@ ns cut up shall they be burned in the fire .
he that walk@@ eth righ@@ te@@ ously , and speak@@ eth u@@ pri@@ gh@@ tly ; he that desp@@ is@@ eth the gain of op@@ pres@@ sions , that shak@@ eth his hands from holding of bribes , that stop@@ pet@@ h his e@@ ars from hearing of blood , and shut@@ te@@ th his eyes from seeing ev@@ il ;
he shall d@@ well on high : his place of defence shall be the mun@@ itions of ro@@ cks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
Th@@ ine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall be@@ hold the land that is very far off .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than th@@ ou can@@ st perce@@ ive ; of a st@@ ammer@@ ing ton@@ gue , that th@@ ou can@@ st not understand .
TH@@ Y tack@@ lings are lo@@ os@@ ed ; they could not well strengthen their m@@ ast , they could not spread the sa@@ il : then is the pre@@ y of a great sp@@ oil divided ; the la@@ me take the pre@@ y .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and he@@ arken , ye people : let the ear@@ th hear , and all that is there@@ in ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord is upon all nations , and his fur@@ y upon all their armies : he hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them , he hat@@ h delivered them to the sla@@ ughter .
their sla@@ in also shall be cast out , and their st@@ ink shall come up out of their car@@ cases , and the mountains shall be mel@@ ted with their blood .
and all the host of heav@@ en shall be dis@@ solved , and the heav@@ ens shall be rol@@ led together as a s@@ cr@@ oll : and all their host shall fall down , as the le@@ af fal@@ le@@ th off from the v@@ ine , and as a falling fi@@ g from the fi@@ g tree .
and the un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns shall come down with them , and the bul@@ loc@@ ks with the bul@@ ls ; and their land shall be so@@ aked with blood , and their d@@ ust made f@@ at with fat@@ ness .
and the stre@@ ams there@@ of shall be turned into pit@@ ch , and the d@@ ust there@@ of into bri@@ m@@ stone , and the land there@@ of shall become burning pit@@ ch .
it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched night nor day ; the smoke there@@ of shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cor@@ mor@@ ant and the bit@@ tern shall poss@@ ess it ; the ow@@ l also and the ra@@ ven shall d@@ well in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of conf@@ usion , and the stones of emp@@ tin@@ ess .
they shall call the no@@ bles there@@ of to the k@@ ing@@ dom , but none shall be there , and all her pr@@ inces shall be nothing .
and thor@@ ns shall come up in her pal@@ aces , net@@ t@@ les and br@@ amb@@ les in the for@@ t@@ resses there@@ of : and it shall be an habi@@ tation of dra@@ g@@ ons , and a court for ow@@ ls .
the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert shall also meet with the wild be@@ asts of the island , and the sat@@ y@@ r shall cry to his fellow ; the scre@@ ech ow@@ l also shall rest there , and find for her@@ self a place of rest .
there shall the great ow@@ l make her n@@ est , and lay , and Hat@@ ch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vul@@ tures also be gathered , every one with her M@@ ate .
and he hat@@ h cast the lot for them , and his hand hat@@ h divided it un@@ to them by line : they shall poss@@ ess it for ever , from generation to generation shall they d@@ well there@@ in .
the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and the sol@@ itary place shall be glad for them ; and the de@@ sert shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and b@@ los@@ so@@ m as the rose .
it shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and re@@ jo@@ ice even with joy and singing : the gl@@ ory of Lebanon shall be given un@@ to it , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Car@@ mel and Shar@@ on , they shall see the gl@@ ory of the Lord , and the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of our God .
then the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d shall be opened , and the e@@ ars of the de@@ af shall be un@@ stopped .
then shall the la@@ me man le@@ ap as an har@@ t , and the ton@@ gue of the dum@@ b sing : for in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness shall waters break out , and stre@@ ams in the de@@ sert .
and the par@@ ched ground shall become a pool , and the thir@@ st@@ y land spr@@ ings of water : in the habi@@ tation of dra@@ g@@ ons , where each lay , shall be gr@@ ass with re@@ eds and rus@@ hes .
now it came to pass in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against all the def@@ enced cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and took them .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great army . and he stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
then came forth un@@ to him Eli@@ ak@@ im , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah 's son , which was over the house , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , A@@ sap@@ h 's son , the rec@@ order .
I say , say@@ est th@@ ou , ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) I have coun@@ sel and strength for war : now on whom dost th@@ ou trust , that th@@ ou rebel@@ lest against me ?
L@@ o , th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test in the staff of this broken Re@@ ed , on Egypt ; where@@ on if a man le@@ an , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it : so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all that trust in him .
now therefore give pledges , I pra@@ y the@@ e , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , He@@ ar ye the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
be@@ w@@ are lest H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you , saying , The Lord will deliver us . H@@ ath any of the go@@ ds of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
then came Eli@@ ak@@ im , the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , that was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of A@@ sap@@ h , the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es rent , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , un@@ to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and they said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , This day is a day of trouble , and of re@@ bu@@ ke , and of b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land .
and he heard say concerning Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , He is come forth to make war with the@@ e . and when he heard it , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God , in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test , dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up un@@ to the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , that d@@ wel@@ lest between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , th@@ ou art the God , even th@@ ou alone , of all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th : th@@ ou h@@ ast made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
In@@ cl@@ ine th@@ ine e@@ ar , O Lord , and hear ; open th@@ ine eyes , O Lord , and see : and hear all the words of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b , which hat@@ h sent to re@@ pro@@ ach the living God .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dig@@ ged , and dr@@ un@@ k water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dri@@ ed up all the rivers of the bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed places .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste def@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded : they were as the gr@@ ass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as cor@@ n b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
because TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me , and TH@@ Y t@@ um@@ ult , is come up into mine e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in TH@@ Y n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and I will turn the@@ e back by the way by which th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
for out of Jer@@ usalem shall go forth a re@@ mn@@ ant , and they that escape out of mount Z@@ ion : the z@@ e@@ al of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , He shall not come into this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there nor come before it with shi@@ elds , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , sa@@ ith the Lord .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord went forth , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans a hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons smo@@ te him with the s@@ word ; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and E@@ sar @@@ -@@ @ h@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and said , Re@@ member now , O Lord , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , how I have walked before the@@ e in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in TH@@ Y sight . and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah we@@ pt sor@@ e .
go , and say to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of David TH@@ Y father , I have heard TH@@ Y pray@@ er , I have seen TH@@ Y te@@ ars : be@@ hold , I will add un@@ to TH@@ Y days fif@@ teen years .
and I will deliver the@@ e and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and I will defend this city .
and this shall be a sign un@@ to the@@ e from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing that he hat@@ h spoken ;
be@@ hold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which is gone down in the sun di@@ al of A@@ haz , ten degrees back@@ ward . so the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
the writing of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , when he had been si@@ ck , and was recovered of his si@@ ck@@ ness :
I said , I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living : I shall be@@ hold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
mine age is depar@@ ted , and is removed from me as a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's tent : I have cut off like a we@@ av@@ er my life : he will cut me off with p@@ ining si@@ ck@@ ness : from day even to night w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou make an end of me .
I rec@@ kon@@ ed ti@@ ll morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my b@@ ones : from day even to night w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou make an end of me .
what shall I say ? he hat@@ h both spoken un@@ to me , and himself hat@@ h done it : I shall go sof@@ tly all my years in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
O Lord , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit : so w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou rec@@ over me , and make me to live .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great bit@@ ter@@ ness : but th@@ ou h@@ ast in love to my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption : for th@@ ou h@@ ast cast all my sin@@ s behind TH@@ Y back .
the Lord was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the str@@ ing@@ ed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord .
for I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had said , Let them take a lum@@ p of fig@@ s , and lay it for a pla@@ ister upon the bo@@ il , and he shall rec@@ over .
at that time Mer@@ od@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ adan , the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah : for he had heard that he had been si@@ ck , and was recovered .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
speak ye comfor@@ tably to Jer@@ usalem , and cry un@@ to her , that her war@@ fare is accomplished , that her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is par@@ don@@ ed : for she hat@@ h received of the Lord 's hand double for all her sin@@ s .
be@@ hold , the Lord God will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
he shall fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : he shall gather the lam@@ bs with his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om , and shall g@@ ently lead those that are with young .
who hat@@ h meas@@ ured the waters in the hol@@ low of his hand , and me@@ ted out heav@@ en with the sp@@ an , and compre@@ hen@@ ded the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scal@@ es , and the hil@@ ls in a balance ?
with whom took he coun@@ sel , and who instruc@@ ted him , and ta@@ ught him in the path of judgment , and ta@@ ught him knowledge , and she@@ wed to him the way of understanding ?
be@@ hold , the nations are as a drop of a bu@@ c@@ ket , and are counted as the small d@@ ust of the balance : be@@ hold , he tak@@ eth up the is@@ les as a very little thing .
he that is so imp@@ over@@ ished that he hat@@ h no ob@@ lation choos@@ eth a tree that will not ro@@ t ; he seek@@ eth un@@ to him a c@@ un@@ ning work@@ man to prepare a Gra@@ ven image , that shall not be moved .
it is he that sit@@ te@@ th upon the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and the inhabitants there@@ of are as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; that stret@@ ch@@ eth out the heav@@ ens as a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th them out as a tent to d@@ well in :
H@@ ast th@@ ou not known ? h@@ ast th@@ ou not heard , that the ever@@ lasting God , the Lord , the Cre@@ ator of the ends of the ear@@ th , fa@@ in@@ te@@ th not , neither is we@@ ary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
but they that wait upon the Lord shall ren@@ ew their strength ; they shall mount up with w@@ ings as e@@ ag@@ les ; they shall run , and not be we@@ ary ; and they shall walk , and not fa@@ int .
so the car@@ pen@@ ter encouraged the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h , and he that smoo@@ th@@ eth with the ham@@ mer him that smo@@ te the an@@ vil , saying , It is ready for the so@@ dering : and he fas@@ tened it with n@@ ails , that it should not be moved .
T@@ ho@@ u whom I have taken from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called the@@ e from the chief men there@@ of , and said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u art my ser@@ vant ; I have chosen the@@ e , and not cast the@@ e away .
fear th@@ ou not ; for I am with the@@ e : be not dis@@ may@@ ed ; for I am TH@@ Y God : I will strengthen the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I will help the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I will up@@ hold the@@ e with the right hand of my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
be@@ hold , all they that were incen@@ sed against the@@ e shall be as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with the@@ e shall per@@ ish .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt seek them , and s@@ halt not find them , even them that conten@@ ded with the@@ e : they that war against the@@ e shall be as nothing , and as a thing of n@@ ought .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ at@@ ter them : and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord , and s@@ halt gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fo@@ un@@ tains in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s : I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
I will plant in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness the c@@ ed@@ ar , the sh@@ it@@ ta@@ h tree , and the m@@ yr@@ tle , and the oil tree ; I will set in the de@@ sert the f@@ ir tree , and the p@@ ine , and the box tree together :
let them bring them forth , and she@@ w us what shall happen : let them she@@ w the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon pr@@ inces as upon mor@@ ter , and as the P@@ ot@@ ter tre@@ ade@@ th cla@@ y .
who hat@@ h declared from the beginning , that we may know ? and be@@ fore@@ time , that we may say , He is righ@@ te@@ ous ? ye@@ a , there is none that she@@ w@@ eth , ye@@ a , there is none that declar@@ eth , ye@@ a , there is none that he@@ aret@@ h your words .
for I be@@ held , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no coun@@ seller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
be@@ hold my ser@@ vant , whom I up@@ hold ; mine elect , in whom my sou@@ l deli@@ gh@@ te@@ th ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
a bru@@ ised Re@@ ed shall he not break , and the smoking fla@@ x shall he not qu@@ en@@ ch : he shall bring forth judgment un@@ to truth .
thus sa@@ ith God the Lord , he that created the heav@@ ens , and stret@@ ched them out ; he that spread forth the ear@@ th , and that which co@@ me@@ th out of it ; he that gi@@ vet@@ h bre@@ ath un@@ to the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk there@@ in :
I the Lord have called the@@ e in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will hold th@@ ine hand , and will keep the@@ e , and give the@@ e for a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the people , for a light of the Gen@@ ti@@ les ;
to open the b@@ lin@@ d eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in d@@ ark@@ ness out of the prison house .
let the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and the cities there@@ of lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ ed@@ ar do@@ th in@@ ha@@ bit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them sh@@ out from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a m@@ igh@@ ty man , he shall stir up je@@ al@@ ous@@ y like a man of war : he shall cry , ye@@ a , ro@@ ar ; he shall prev@@ ail against his enem@@ ies .
I will make waste mountains and hil@@ ls , and d@@ ry up all their her@@ bs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will d@@ ry up the po@@ ols .
they shall be turned back , they shall be greatly as@@ ha@@ med , that trust in Gra@@ ven images , that say to the m@@ ol@@ ten images , Y@@ e are our go@@ ds .
who gave Jac@@ o@@ b for a sp@@ oil , and Israel to the rob@@ bers ? did not the Lord , he against whom we have sin@@ ned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to his law .
therefore he hat@@ h p@@ oured upon him the fur@@ y of his an@@ ger , and the strength of battle : and it hat@@ h set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
when th@@ ou pass@@ est through the waters , I will be with the@@ e ; and through the rivers , they shall not over@@ flow the@@ e : when th@@ ou walk@@ est through the fire , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be burned ; neither shall the fla@@ me kin@@ dle upon the@@ e .
since th@@ ou w@@ ast pre@@ ci@@ ous in my sight , th@@ ou h@@ ast been honour@@ able , and I have lov@@ ed the@@ e : therefore will I give men for the@@ e , and people for TH@@ Y life .
I have declared , and have sav@@ ed , and I have she@@ wed , when there was no st@@ range go@@ d among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I am God .
Ye@@ a , before the day was I am he ; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand : I will work , and who shall let it ?
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , your re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel ; For your sake I have sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and have brought down all their no@@ bles , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , whose cry is in the ships .
be@@ hold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and rivers in the de@@ sert .
the be@@ ast of the field shall honour me , the dra@@ g@@ ons and the ow@@ ls : because I give waters in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and rivers in the de@@ sert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast not brought me the small c@@ attle of TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings ; neither h@@ ast th@@ ou honoured me with TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . I have not caused the@@ e to serve with an offering , nor we@@ ar@@ ied the@@ e with incen@@ se .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , neither h@@ ast th@@ ou filled me with the f@@ at of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es : but th@@ ou h@@ ast made me to serve with TH@@ Y sin@@ s , th@@ ou h@@ ast we@@ ar@@ ied me with th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
I , even I , am he that blo@@ tte@@ th out TH@@ Y trans@@ gres@@ sions for mine own sake , and will not remember TH@@ Y sin@@ s .
for I will p@@ our water upon him that is thir@@ st@@ y , and floods upon the d@@ ry ground : I will p@@ our my spirit upon TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and my b@@ les@@ sing upon th@@ ine off@@ spring :
be@@ hold , all his fel@@ lows shall be as@@ ha@@ med : and the work@@ men , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be as@@ ha@@ med together .
the S@@ mit@@ h with the ton@@ gs both wor@@ ket@@ h in the co@@ als , and fas@@ hi@@ on@@ eth it with ham@@ mers , and wor@@ ket@@ h it with the strength of his arms : ye@@ a , he is hun@@ gry , and his strength fail@@ eth : he drin@@ ket@@ h no water , and is fa@@ int .
and the resi@@ due there@@ of he mak@@ eth a go@@ d , even his Gra@@ ven image : he fal@@ le@@ th down un@@ to it , and wor@@ ship@@ pet@@ h it , and pray@@ eth un@@ to it , and sa@@ ith , D@@ eli@@ ver me ; for th@@ ou art my go@@ d .
I have blo@@ t@@ ted out , as a th@@ ick cl@@ oud , TH@@ Y trans@@ gres@@ sions , and , as a cl@@ oud , TH@@ Y sin@@ s : return un@@ to me ; for I have re@@ deemed the@@ e .
I will go before the@@ e , and make the cro@@ oked places stra@@ ight : I will break in pieces the gates of br@@ ass , and cut in s@@ under the bars of iron :
and I will give the@@ e the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that th@@ ou may@@ est know that I , the Lord , which call the@@ e by TH@@ Y name , am the God of Israel .
for Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant 's sake , and Israel mine elect , I have even called the@@ e by TH@@ Y name : I have sur@@ named the@@ e , though th@@ ou h@@ ast not known me .
I am the Lord , and there is none else , there is no God bes@@ ide me : I gir@@ ded the@@ e , though th@@ ou h@@ ast not known me :
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none bes@@ ide me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
I have made the ear@@ th , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens , and all their host have I comman@@ ded .
they shall be as@@ ha@@ med , and also con@@ founded , all of them : they shall go to conf@@ usion together that are makers of id@@ ols .
assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their Gra@@ ven image , and pra@@ y un@@ to a go@@ d that can@@ not save .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my m@@ outh in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and shall not return , That un@@ to me every k@@ ne@@ e shall bo@@ w , every ton@@ gue shall swe@@ ar .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the house of Israel , which are bor@@ ne by me from the bel@@ ly , which are carried from the w@@ om@@ b :
they la@@ vis@@ h gold out of the bag , and we@@ igh silver in the balance , and h@@ ire a gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h ; and he mak@@ eth it a go@@ d : they fall down , ye@@ a , they worship .
they bear him upon the sho@@ ul@@ der , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he stan@@ de@@ th ; from his place shall he not remove : ye@@ a , one shall cry un@@ to him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
calling a ra@@ ven@@ ous bird from the east , the man that execu@@ te@@ th my coun@@ sel from a far country : ye@@ a , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have pur@@ posed it , I will also do it .
TH@@ Y nak@@ edn@@ ess shall be uncovered , ye@@ a , TH@@ Y sh@@ ame shall be seen : I will take ven@@ ge@@ ance , and I will not meet the@@ e as a man .
I was wro@@ th with my people , I have pollu@@ ted mine inher@@ it@@ ance , and given them into th@@ ine hand : th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st she@@ w them no mer@@ cy ; upon the ancient h@@ ast th@@ ou very heavily laid TH@@ Y yok@@ e .
and th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I shall be a la@@ dy for ever : so that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not lay these things to TH@@ Y heart , neither di@@ d@@ st remember the latter end of it .
for th@@ ou h@@ ast tr@@ usted in TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : th@@ ou h@@ ast said , N@@ one se@@ eth me . TH@@ Y wis@@ dom and TH@@ Y knowledge , it hat@@ h per@@ ver@@ ted the@@ e ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast said in th@@ ine heart , I am , and none else bes@@ ide me .
stand now with th@@ ine en@@ chan@@ tments , and with the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y sor@@ cer@@ ies , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured from TH@@ Y youth ; if so be th@@ ou s@@ halt be able to profit , if so be th@@ ou may@@ est prev@@ ail .
T@@ ho@@ u art we@@ ar@@ ied in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y coun@@ sels . let now the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the star@@ gaz@@ ers , the monthly pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tic@@ ators , stand up , and save the@@ e from these things that shall come upon the@@ e .
thus shall they be un@@ to the@@ e with whom th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured , even TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts , from TH@@ Y youth : they shall w@@ ander every one to his quarter ; none shall save the@@ e .
hear ye this , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Ju@@ da@@ h , which swe@@ ar by the name of the Lord , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I she@@ wed them ; I did them su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and they came to pass .
I have even from the beginning declared it to the@@ e ; before it came to pass I she@@ wed it the@@ e : lest th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , M@@ ine i@@ dol hat@@ h done them , and my Gra@@ ven image , and my m@@ ol@@ ten image , hat@@ h comman@@ ded them .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast heard , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ? I have she@@ wed the@@ e new things from this time , even hidden things , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not know them .
they are created now , and not from the beginning ; even before the day when th@@ ou hear@@ dest them not ; lest th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , be@@ hold , I knew them .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou hear@@ dest not ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou k@@ newest not ; ye@@ a , from that time that th@@ ine e@@ ar was not opened : for I knew that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest deal very t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and w@@ ast called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the w@@ om@@ b .
for my name 's sake will I def@@ er mine an@@ ger , and for my praise will I refrain for the@@ e , that I cut the@@ e not off .
mine hand also hat@@ h laid the foundation of the ear@@ th , and my right hand hat@@ h sp@@ an@@ ned the heav@@ ens : when I call un@@ to them , they stand up together .
all ye , assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , and hear ; which among them hat@@ h declared these things ? the Lord hat@@ h lov@@ ed him : he will do his pleas@@ ure on Bab@@ yl@@ on , and his arm shall be on the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
come ye near un@@ to me , hear ye this ; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I : and now the Lord God , and his Spiri@@ t , hat@@ h sent me .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , TH@@ Y Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel ; I am the Lord TH@@ Y God which teach@@ eth the@@ e to profit , which le@@ ade@@ th the@@ e by the way that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest go .
TH@@ Y se@@ ed also had been as the s@@ and , and the off@@ spring of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s like the gra@@ v@@ el there@@ of ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
and they thir@@ s@@ ted not when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he cla@@ ve the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
listen , O is@@ les , un@@ to me ; and he@@ arken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hat@@ h called me from the w@@ om@@ b ; from the bo@@ wel@@ s of my mother hat@@ h he made mention of my name .
and he hat@@ h made my m@@ outh like a sharp s@@ word ; in the shadow of his hand hat@@ h he hi@@ d me , and made me a pol@@ ished S@@ haf@@ t ; in his qu@@ i@@ ver hat@@ h he hi@@ d me ;
that th@@ ou may@@ est say to the prisoners , G@@ o forth ; to them that are in d@@ ark@@ ness , She@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves . they shall fe@@ ed in the ways , and their pas@@ tures shall be in all high places .
they shall not hunger nor thir@@ st ; neither shall the heat nor sun sm@@ ite them : for he that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on them shall lead them , even by the spr@@ ings of water shall he guide them .
be@@ hold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sin@@ im .
for TH@@ Y waste and TH@@ Y de@@ so@@ late places , and the land of TH@@ Y destruction , shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants , and they that sw@@ allowed the@@ e up shall be far away .
the children which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , after th@@ ou h@@ ast lost the other , shall say again in th@@ ine e@@ ars , The place is too stra@@ it for me : give place to me that I may d@@ well .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God , be@@ hold , I will lift up mine hand to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and set up my standard to the people : and they shall bring TH@@ Y sons in their arms , and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be carried upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
and kings shall be TH@@ Y nur@@ sing fa@@ thers , and their que@@ ens TH@@ Y nur@@ sing mothers : they shall bo@@ w down to the@@ e with their face toward the ear@@ th , and lick up the d@@ ust of TH@@ Y feet ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord : for they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med that wait for me .
but thus sa@@ ith the Lord , E@@ ven the cap@@ tives of the m@@ igh@@ ty shall be taken away , and the pre@@ y of the ter@@ ri@@ ble shall be delivered : for I will conten@@ d with him that conten@@ de@@ th with the@@ e , and I will save TH@@ Y children .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , W@@ here is the bill of your mother 's div@@ or@@ cement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? be@@ hold , for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have ye sold yo@@ ur@@ selves , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions is your mother put away .
the Lord God hat@@ h given me the ton@@ gue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is we@@ ary : he w@@ aken@@ eth morning by morning , he w@@ aken@@ eth mine e@@ ar to hear as the learned .
I gave my back to the s@@ mit@@ ers , and my che@@ eks to them that p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir : I hi@@ d not my face from sh@@ ame and sp@@ it@@ ting .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be con@@ founded : therefore have I set my face like a F@@ lin@@ t , and I know that I shall not be as@@ ha@@ med .
he is near that justi@@ fi@@ eth me ; who will conten@@ d with me ? let us stand together : who is mine ad@@ versary ? let him come near to me .
be@@ hold , the Lord God will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wa@@ x old as a gar@@ ment ; the mo@@ th shall eat them up .
who is among you that fear@@ eth the Lord , that obe@@ yet@@ h the voice of his ser@@ vant , that walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness , and hat@@ h no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
Hear@@ ken to me , ye that follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , ye that seek the Lord : look un@@ to the rock wh@@ ence ye are he@@ wn , and to the hol@@ e of the p@@ it wh@@ ence ye are dig@@ ged .
for the Lord shall comfor@@ t Z@@ ion : he will comfor@@ t all her waste places ; and he will make her w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like E@@ den , and her de@@ sert like the gar@@ den of the Lord ; joy and gla@@ d@@ ness shall be found there@@ in , Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of me@@ lo@@ dy .
Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , my people ; and give e@@ ar un@@ to me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is near ; my sal@@ vation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the is@@ les shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
for the mo@@ th shall eat them up like a gar@@ ment , and the wor@@ m shall eat them like wo@@ ol : but my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall be for ever , and my sal@@ vation from generation to generation .
art th@@ ou not it which hat@@ h dri@@ ed the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hat@@ h made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the ran@@ so@@ med to pass over ?
therefore the re@@ deemed of the Lord shall return , and come with singing un@@ to Z@@ ion ; and ever@@ lasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gla@@ d@@ ness and joy ; and sor@@ row and mourning shall flee away .
I , even I , am he that comfor@@ te@@ th you : who art th@@ ou , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be made as gr@@ ass ;
the cap@@ tive ex@@ ile has@@ ten@@ eth that he may be lo@@ os@@ ed , and that he should not die in the p@@ it , nor that his bread should fail .
aw@@ ake , aw@@ ake , stand up , O Jer@@ usalem , which h@@ ast dr@@ un@@ k at the hand of the Lord the c@@ up of his fur@@ y ; th@@ ou h@@ ast dr@@ un@@ ken the d@@ reg@@ s of the c@@ up of tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and wr@@ ung them out .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hat@@ h brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hat@@ h brought up .
these two things are come un@@ to the@@ e ; who shall be sor@@ ry for the@@ e ? de@@ so@@ lation , and destruction , and the fam@@ ine , and the s@@ word : by whom shall I comfor@@ t the@@ e ?
TH@@ Y sons have fa@@ in@@ ted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as a wild bul@@ l in a net : they are full of the fur@@ y of the Lord , the re@@ bu@@ ke of TH@@ Y God .
thus sa@@ ith TH@@ Y Lord the Lord , and TH@@ Y God that ple@@ ade@@ th the cause of his people , be@@ hold , I have taken out of th@@ ine hand the c@@ up of tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , even the d@@ reg@@ s of the c@@ up of my fur@@ y ; th@@ ou s@@ halt no more drink it again :
but I will put it into the hand of them that aff@@ lic@@ t the@@ e ; which have said to TH@@ Y sou@@ l , bo@@ w down , that we may go over : and th@@ ou h@@ ast laid TH@@ Y body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over .
aw@@ ake , aw@@ ake ; put on TH@@ Y strength , O Z@@ ion ; put on TH@@ Y beautiful gar@@ ments , O Jer@@ usalem , the hol@@ y city : for hen@@ ce@@ forth there shall no more come into the@@ e the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised and the un@@ clean .
TH@@ Y watch@@ men shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the Lord shall bring again Z@@ ion .
the Lord hat@@ h made b@@ are his hol@@ y arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the ear@@ th shall see the sal@@ vation of our God .
de@@ part ye , de@@ part ye , go ye out from th@@ ence , touch no un@@ clean thing ; go ye out of the mid@@ st of her ; be ye clean , that bear the vessels of the Lord .
for ye shall not go out with has@@ te , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; the kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a d@@ ry ground : he hat@@ h no form nor co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he is desp@@ ised and rejected of men ; a man of sor@@ ro@@ ws , and acqu@@ ain@@ ted with gri@@ ef : and we hi@@ d as it were our faces from him ; he was desp@@ ised , and we es@@ te@@ emed him not .
all we like she@@ ep have gone as@@ tra@@ y ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the Lord hat@@ h laid on him the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of us all .
he was op@@ pressed , and he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , yet he opened not his m@@ outh : he is brought as a lam@@ b to the sla@@ ughter , and as a she@@ ep before her s@@ hear@@ ers is dum@@ b , so he open@@ eth not his m@@ outh .
and he made his grave with the w@@ ic@@ ked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any dec@@ e@@ it in his m@@ outh .
en@@ large the place of TH@@ Y tent , and let them stretch forth the cur@@ tains of th@@ ine habi@@ tations : spar@@ e not , leng@@ then TH@@ Y cor@@ ds , and strengthen TH@@ Y stakes ;
for th@@ ou s@@ halt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall inher@@ it the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and make the de@@ so@@ late cities to be inhabited .
fear not ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be as@@ ha@@ med : neither be th@@ ou con@@ founded ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be put to sh@@ ame : for th@@ ou s@@ halt forget the sh@@ ame of TH@@ Y youth , and s@@ halt not remember the re@@ pro@@ ach of TH@@ Y wi@@ do@@ who@@ od any more .
for this is as the waters of No@@ ah un@@ to me : for as I have sworn that the waters of No@@ ah should no more go over the ear@@ th ; so have I sworn that I would not be wro@@ th with the@@ e , nor re@@ bu@@ ke the@@ e .
for the mountains shall de@@ part , and the hil@@ ls be removed ; but my kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from the@@ e , neither shall the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the Lord that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on the@@ e .
and I will make TH@@ Y windows of ag@@ ates , and TH@@ Y gates of car@@ bun@@ c@@ les , and all TH@@ Y borders of pleas@@ ant stones .
and all TH@@ Y children shall be ta@@ ught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of TH@@ Y children .
in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness s@@ halt th@@ ou be established : th@@ ou s@@ halt be far from op@@ pression ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near the@@ e .
H@@ o , every one that thir@@ ste@@ th , come ye to the waters , and he that hat@@ h no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; ye@@ a , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satis@@ fi@@ eth not ? he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your sou@@ l de@@ light itself in fat@@ ness .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt call a nation that th@@ ou know@@ est not , and nations that knew not the@@ e shall run un@@ to the@@ e because of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hat@@ h gl@@ ori@@ fied the@@ e .
let the w@@ ic@@ ked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous man his th@@ ou@@ ghts : and let him return un@@ to the Lord , and he will have mer@@ cy upon him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly par@@ don .
for as the rain co@@ me@@ th down , and the snow from heav@@ en , and retur@@ net@@ h not th@@ ither , but water@@ eth the ear@@ th , and mak@@ eth it bring forth and bu@@ d , that it may give se@@ ed to the so@@ wer , and bread to the e@@ ater :
so shall my word be that go@@ eth forth out of my m@@ outh : it shall not return un@@ to me vo@@ id , but it shall accomp@@ lish that which I ple@@ ase , and it shall prosp@@ er in the thing where@@ to I sent it .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hil@@ ls shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall cla@@ p their hands .
instead of the Th@@ or@@ n shall come up the f@@ ir tree , and instead of the bri@@ er shall come up the m@@ yr@@ tle tree : and it shall be to the Lord for a name , for an ever@@ lasting sign that shall not be cut off .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man that do@@ eth this , and the son of man that lay@@ eth hold on it ; that keep@@ eth the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath from poll@@ ut@@ ing it , and keep@@ eth his hand from doing any ev@@ il .
neither let the son of the st@@ ran@@ ger , that hat@@ h joined himself to the Lord , speak , saying , The Lord hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly separated me from his people : neither let the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch say , be@@ hold , I am a d@@ ry tree .
even un@@ to them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : I will give them an ever@@ lasting name , that shall not be cut off .
even them will I bring to my hol@@ y mountain , and make them jo@@ y@@ ful in my house of pray@@ er : their bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be accepted upon mine alt@@ ar ; for mine house shall be called an house of pray@@ er for all people .
Ye@@ a , they are gre@@ edy do@@ gs which can never have enough , and they are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds that can@@ not understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
T@@ ho@@ u art we@@ ar@@ ied in the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y way ; yet sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou not , There is no hope : th@@ ou h@@ ast found the life of th@@ ine hand ; therefore th@@ ou w@@ ast not gri@@ ev@@ ed .
for thus sa@@ ith the high and lo@@ f@@ ty One that inhabi@@ te@@ th et@@ ern@@ ity , whose name is Holy ; I d@@ well in the high and hol@@ y place , with him also that is of a contr@@ ite and hum@@ ble spirit , to revive the spirit of the hum@@ ble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite ones .
for I will not conten@@ d for ever , neither will I be always wro@@ th : for the spirit should fail before me , and the so@@ ul@@ s which I have made .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness was I wro@@ th , and smo@@ te him : I hi@@ d me , and was wro@@ th , and he went on fro@@ war@@ dly in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the li@@ ps ; Peace , peace to him that is far off , and to him that is near , sa@@ ith the Lord ; and I will he@@ al him .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have we fas@@ ted , say they , and th@@ ou se@@ est not ? where@@ fore have we aff@@ lic@@ ted our sou@@ l , and th@@ ou tak@@ est no knowledge ? be@@ hold , in the day of your fast ye find pleas@@ ure , and exact all your la@@ bour@@ s .
be@@ hold , ye fast for stri@@ fe and debate , and to sm@@ ite with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose the bands of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , to un@@ do the heavy bur@@ den@@ s , and to let the op@@ pressed go free , and that ye break every yok@@ e ?
is it not to deal TH@@ Y bread to the hun@@ gry , and that th@@ ou bring the poor that are cast out to TH@@ Y house ? when th@@ ou se@@ est the nak@@ ed , that th@@ ou cover him ; and that th@@ ou hide not th@@ y@@ self from th@@ ine own f@@ les@@ h ?
then shall TH@@ Y light break forth as the morning , and th@@ ine health shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y : and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before the@@ e ; the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall be TH@@ Y r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou call , and the Lord shall answer ; th@@ ou s@@ halt cry , and he shall say , H@@ ere I am . if th@@ ou take away from the mid@@ st of the@@ e the yok@@ e , the putting forth of the fin@@ ger , and speaking van@@ ity ;
and if th@@ ou draw out TH@@ Y sou@@ l to the hun@@ gry , and satisfy the aff@@ lic@@ ted sou@@ l ; then shall TH@@ Y light rise in ob@@ sc@@ urity , and TH@@ Y d@@ ark@@ ness be as the no@@ on@@ day :
and the Lord shall guide the@@ e continu@@ ally , and satisfy TH@@ Y sou@@ l in drought , and make f@@ at TH@@ Y b@@ ones : and th@@ ou s@@ halt be like a wat@@ ered gar@@ den , and like a spring of water , whose waters fail not .
be@@ hold , the Lord 's hand is not shor@@ tened , that it can@@ not save ; neither his e@@ ar heavy , that it can@@ not hear :
but your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have separated between you and your God , and your sin@@ s have hi@@ d his face from you , that he will not hear .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the b@@ lin@@ d , and we gro@@ pe as if we had no eyes : we st@@ um@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the night ; we are in de@@ so@@ late places as dead men .
for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are multi@@ p@@ lied before the@@ e , and our sin@@ s testify against us : for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are with us ; and as for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , we know them ;
Ye@@ a , truth fail@@ eth ; and he that depar@@ te@@ th from ev@@ il mak@@ eth himself a pre@@ y : and the Lord saw it , and it disp@@ le@@ ased him that there was no judgment .
and he saw that there was no man , and won@@ dered that there was no inter@@ c@@ essor : therefore his arm brought sal@@ vation un@@ to him ; and his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , it sustained him .
for he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and an hel@@ met of sal@@ vation upon his head ; and he put on the gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a clo@@ ke .
according to their de@@ eds , accor@@ d@@ ingly he will repay , fur@@ y to his ad@@ vers@@ aries , re@@ comp@@ ence to his enem@@ ies ; to the islands he will repay re@@ comp@@ ence .
as for me , this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , sa@@ ith the Lord ; My spirit that is upon the@@ e , and my words which I have put in TH@@ Y m@@ outh , shall not de@@ part out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , nor out of the m@@ outh of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , nor out of the m@@ outh of TH@@ Y se@@ ed 's se@@ ed , sa@@ ith the Lord , from hen@@ ce@@ forth and for ever .
for , be@@ hold , the d@@ ark@@ ness shall cover the ear@@ th , and gross d@@ ark@@ ness the people : but the Lord shall arise upon the@@ e , and his gl@@ ory shall be seen upon the@@ e .
lift up th@@ ine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to the@@ e : TH@@ Y sons shall come from far , and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be nur@@ sed at TH@@ Y side .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt see , and flow together , and th@@ ine heart shall fear , and be en@@ lar@@ ged ; because the ab@@ und@@ ance of the sea shall be conver@@ ted un@@ to the@@ e , the forces of the Gen@@ ti@@ les shall come un@@ to the@@ e .
the multi@@ tude of ca@@ me@@ ls shall cover the@@ e , the dro@@ med@@ aries of Mi@@ dian and Ep@@ ha@@ h ; all they from She@@ ba shall come : they shall bring gold and incen@@ se ; and they shall she@@ w forth the pra@@ ises of the Lord .
and the sons of st@@ ran@@ gers shall build up TH@@ Y walls , and their kings shall minister un@@ to the@@ e : for in my wr@@ ath I smo@@ te the@@ e , but in my favour have I had mer@@ cy on the@@ e .
therefore TH@@ Y gates shall be open continu@@ ally ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring un@@ to the@@ e the forces of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and that their kings may be brought .
the gl@@ ory of Lebanon shall come un@@ to the@@ e , the f@@ ir tree , the p@@ ine tree , and the box together , to be@@ auti@@ fy the place of my sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; and I will make the place of my feet g@@ lor@@ ious .
the sons also of them that aff@@ lic@@ ted the@@ e shall come ben@@ ding un@@ to the@@ e ; and all they that desp@@ ised the@@ e shall bo@@ w themselves down at the so@@ les of TH@@ Y feet ; and they shall call the@@ e , The city of the Lord , The Z@@ ion of the Holy One of Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also su@@ ck the milk of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and s@@ halt su@@ ck the bre@@ ast of kings : and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I the Lord am TH@@ Y Sav@@ i@@ our and TH@@ Y Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b .
for br@@ ass I will bring gold , and for iron I will bring silver , and for wood br@@ ass , and for stones iron : I will also make TH@@ Y officers peace , and th@@ ine ex@@ actors righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
the sun shall be no more TH@@ Y light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light un@@ to the@@ e : but the Lord shall be un@@ to the@@ e an ever@@ lasting light , and TH@@ Y God TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
TH@@ Y sun shall no more go down ; neither shall TH@@ Y moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be th@@ ine ever@@ lasting light , and the days of TH@@ Y mourning shall be ended .
TH@@ Y people also shall be all righ@@ te@@ ous : they shall inher@@ it the land for ever , the branch of my plan@@ ting , the work of my hands , that I may be gl@@ ori@@ fied .
and st@@ ran@@ gers shall stand and fe@@ ed your f@@ loc@@ ks , and the sons of the ali@@ en shall be your p@@ low@@ men and your vin@@ ed@@ res@@ s@@ ers .
but ye shall be named the pri@@ ests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and in their gl@@ ory shall ye bo@@ ast yo@@ ur@@ selves .
for your sh@@ ame ye shall have double ; and for conf@@ usion they shall re@@ jo@@ ice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall poss@@ ess the double : ever@@ lasting joy shall be un@@ to them .
and their se@@ ed shall be known among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and their off@@ spring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the se@@ ed which the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed .
for as the ear@@ th br@@ ing@@ eth forth her bu@@ d , and as the gar@@ den ca@@ us@@ eth the things that are so@@ wn in it to spring forth ; so the Lord God will cause righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness there@@ of go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and the sal@@ vation there@@ of as a lam@@ p that bur@@ net@@ h .
and the Gen@@ ti@@ les shall see TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and all kings TH@@ Y gl@@ ory : and th@@ ou s@@ halt be called by a new name , which the m@@ outh of the Lord shall name .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also be a cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory in the hand of the Lord , and a royal di@@ ade@@ m in the hand of TH@@ Y God .
the Lord hat@@ h sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , su@@ rely I will no more give TH@@ Y cor@@ n to be meat for th@@ ine enem@@ ies ; and the sons of the st@@ ran@@ ger shall not drink TH@@ Y wine , for the which th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured :
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the Lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my hol@@ iness .
go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h proclaimed un@@ to the end of the world , S@@ ay ye to the daughter of Z@@ ion , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y sal@@ vation co@@ me@@ th ; be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I won@@ dered that there was none to up@@ hold : therefore mine own arm brought sal@@ vation un@@ to me ; and my fur@@ y , it up@@ held me .
and I will tre@@ ad down the people in mine an@@ ger , and make them dr@@ un@@ k in my fur@@ y , and I will bring down their strength to the ear@@ th .
I will mention the lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ nesses of the Lord , and the pra@@ ises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hat@@ h bes@@ to@@ wed on us , and the great Go@@ od@@ ness toward the house of Israel , which he hat@@ h bes@@ to@@ wed on them according to his mer@@ cies , and according to the multi@@ tude of his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ nesses .
in all their aff@@ li@@ ction he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , and the an@@ gel of his presence sav@@ ed them : in his love and in his p@@ ity he re@@ deemed them ; and he b@@ are them , and carried them all the days of old .
as a be@@ ast go@@ eth down into the val@@ ley , the Spiri@@ t of the Lord caused him to rest : so di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou lead TH@@ Y people , to make th@@ y@@ self a g@@ lor@@ ious name .
look down from heav@@ en , and be@@ hold from the habi@@ tation of TH@@ Y hol@@ iness and of TH@@ Y gl@@ ory : where is TH@@ Y z@@ e@@ al and TH@@ Y strength , the so@@ unding of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s and of TH@@ Y mer@@ cies toward me ? are they re@@ strained ?
when th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st ter@@ ri@@ ble things which we looked not for , th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st down , the mountains flow@@ ed down at TH@@ Y presence .
T@@ ho@@ u me@@ e@@ test him that re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth and wor@@ ket@@ h righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , those that remember the@@ e in TH@@ Y ways : be@@ hold , th@@ ou art wro@@ th ; for we have sin@@ ned : in those is continu@@ ance , and we shall be sav@@ ed .
but we are all as an un@@ clean thing , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses are as fil@@ thy ra@@ gs ; and we all do fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , have taken us away .
and there is none that cal@@ le@@ th upon TH@@ Y name , that s@@ tir@@ re@@ th up himself to take hold of the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast hi@@ d TH@@ Y face from us , and h@@ ast consu@@ med us , because of our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
but now , O Lord , th@@ ou art our father ; we are the cla@@ y , and th@@ ou our P@@ ot@@ ter ; and we all are the work of TH@@ Y hand .
our hol@@ y and our beautiful house , where our fa@@ thers praised the@@ e , is burned up with fire : and all our pleas@@ ant things are laid waste .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , be@@ hold me , be@@ hold me , un@@ to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day un@@ to a rebel@@ li@@ ous people , which walk@@ eth in a way that was not good , after their own th@@ ou@@ ghts ;
which remain among the graves , and lo@@ dge in the monuments , which eat sw@@ ine 's f@@ les@@ h , and bro@@ th of ab@@ omin@@ able things is in their vessels ;
and I will bring forth a se@@ ed out of Jac@@ o@@ b , and out of Ju@@ da@@ h an inher@@ it@@ or of my mountains : and mine elect shall inher@@ it it , and my servants shall d@@ well there .
and Shar@@ on shall be a fold of f@@ loc@@ ks , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or a place for the her@@ ds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me .
but be ye glad and re@@ jo@@ ice for ever in that which I create : for , be@@ hold , I create Jer@@ usalem a re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , and her people a joy .
and I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of we@@ eping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of cr@@ ying .
and they shall build houses , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not build , and another in@@ ha@@ bit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , The heav@@ en is my th@@ r@@ one , and the ear@@ th is my foot@@ st@@ ool : where is the house that ye build un@@ to me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
I also will choose their de@@ lu@@ sions , and will bring their fears upon them ; because when I called , none did answer ; when I sp@@ ake , they did not hear : but they did ev@@ il before mine eyes , and chose that in which I deli@@ gh@@ ted not .
that ye may su@@ ck , and be satisfied with the bre@@ asts of her con@@ so@@ lations ; that ye may milk out , and be deli@@ gh@@ ted with the ab@@ und@@ ance of her gl@@ ory .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the gl@@ ory of the Gen@@ ti@@ les like a flow@@ ing stream : then shall ye su@@ ck , ye shall be bor@@ ne upon her sides , and be d@@ and@@ led upon her k@@ ne@@ es .
and when ye see this , your heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and your b@@ ones shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like an her@@ b : and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants , and his in@@ dign@@ ation toward his enem@@ ies .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord will come with fire , and with his char@@ i@@ ots like a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , to ren@@ der his an@@ ger with fur@@ y , and his re@@ bu@@ ke with fla@@ mes of fire .
and it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another , and from one sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath to another , shall all f@@ les@@ h come to worship before me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the car@@ cases of the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for their wor@@ m shall not die , neither shall their fire be qu@@ en@@ ched ; and they shall be an ab@@ hor@@ ring un@@ to all f@@ les@@ h .
the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , of the pri@@ ests that were in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the thir@@ teen@@ th year of his reign .
before I formed the@@ e in the bel@@ ly I knew the@@ e ; and before th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st forth out of the w@@ om@@ b I sanc@@ ti@@ fied the@@ e , and I or@@ da@@ ined the@@ e a pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to the nations .
but the Lord said un@@ to me , S@@ ay not , I am a child : for th@@ ou s@@ halt go to all that I shall send the@@ e , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I command the@@ e th@@ ou s@@ halt speak .
then the Lord put forth his hand , and touched my m@@ outh . and the Lord said un@@ to me , be@@ hold , I have put my words in TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
see , I have this day set the@@ e over the nations and over the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
and I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , who have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the works of their own hands .
hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and all the families of the house of Israel :
is Israel a ser@@ vant ? is he a home@@ born sla@@ ve ? why is he sp@@ o@@ iled ?
H@@ ast th@@ ou not proc@@ ured this un@@ to th@@ y@@ self , in that th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ sak@@ en the Lord TH@@ Y God , when he led the@@ e by the way ?
and now what h@@ ast th@@ ou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of S@@ ih@@ or ? or what h@@ ast th@@ ou to do in the way of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , to drink the waters of the river ?
a wild ass used to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleas@@ ure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not we@@ ary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
with@@ hold TH@@ Y fo@@ ot from being un@@ sho@@ d , and TH@@ Y thro@@ at from thir@@ st : but th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , There is no hope : no ; for I have lov@@ ed st@@ ran@@ gers , and after them will I go .
as the th@@ i@@ ef is as@@ ha@@ med when he is found , so is the house of Israel as@@ ha@@ med ; they , their kings , their pr@@ inces , and their pri@@ ests , and their pro@@ ph@@ ets ,
but where are TH@@ Y go@@ ds that th@@ ou h@@ ast made the@@ e ? let them arise , if they can save the@@ e in the time of TH@@ Y trouble : for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities are TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h .
also in TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts is found the blood of the so@@ ul@@ s of the poor inno@@ cents : I have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
yet th@@ ou say@@ est , Bec@@ ause I am innocent , su@@ rely his an@@ ger shall turn from me . be@@ hold , I will p@@ lead with the@@ e , because th@@ ou say@@ est , I have not sin@@ ned .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt go forth from him , and th@@ ine hands upon th@@ ine head : for the Lord hat@@ h rejected TH@@ Y confi@@ den@@ ces , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not prosp@@ er in them .
and I saw , when for all the causes where@@ by back@@ sli@@ ding Israel committed ad@@ ul@@ tery I had put her away , and given her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce ; yet her t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous sister Ju@@ da@@ h fear@@ ed not , but went and played the har@@ lot also .
and it came to pass through the ligh@@ t@@ ness of her wh@@ ore@@ dom , that she def@@ iled the land , and committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with stones and with sto@@ cks .
only acknowledge th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that th@@ ou h@@ ast trans@@ g@@ ressed against the Lord TH@@ Y God , and h@@ ast sc@@ at@@ tered TH@@ Y ways to the st@@ ran@@ gers under every green tree , and ye have not obe@@ yed my voice , sa@@ ith the Lord .
at that time they shall call Jer@@ usalem the th@@ r@@ one of the Lord ; and all the nations shall be gathered un@@ to it , to the name of the Lord , to Jer@@ usalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imag@@ ination of their ev@@ il heart .
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to your fa@@ thers .
a voice was heard upon the high places , we@@ eping and supp@@ lic@@ ations of the children of Israel : for they have per@@ ver@@ ted their way , and they have forgotten the Lord their God .
truly in v@@ ain is sal@@ vation hoped for from the hil@@ ls , and from the multi@@ tude of mountains : truly in the Lord our God is the sal@@ vation of Israel .
declare ye in Ju@@ da@@ h , and publish in Jer@@ usalem ; and say , blow ye the tr@@ ump@@ et in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , and let us go into the def@@ enced cities .
the lion is come up from his th@@ ic@@ ket , and the destro@@ yer of the Gen@@ ti@@ les is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make TH@@ Y land de@@ so@@ late ; and TH@@ Y cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabi@@ tant .
and it shall come to pass at that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , that the heart of the king shall per@@ ish , and the heart of the pr@@ inces ; and the pri@@ ests shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall wonder .
be@@ hold , he shall come up as cl@@ ou@@ ds , and his char@@ i@@ ots shall be as a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : his hor@@ ses are swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les . Wo@@ e un@@ to us ! for we are sp@@ o@@ iled .
my bo@@ wel@@ s , my bo@@ wel@@ s ! I am pain@@ ed at my very heart ; my heart mak@@ eth a no@@ ise in me ; I can@@ not hold my peace , because th@@ ou h@@ ast heard , O my sou@@ l , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , the alarm of war .
for my people is fo@@ ol@@ ish , they have not known me ; they are so@@ tti@@ sh children , and they have none understanding : they are wise to do ev@@ il , but to do good they have no knowledge .
I be@@ held the ear@@ th , and , lo , it was without form , and vo@@ id ; and the heav@@ ens , and they had no light .
I be@@ held , and , lo , the fruit@@ ful place was a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and all the cities there@@ of were broken down at the presence of the Lord , and by his fierce an@@ ger .
for this shall the ear@@ th mour@@ n , and the heav@@ ens above be black : because I have spoken it , I have pur@@ posed it , and will not rep@@ ent , neither will I turn back from it .
the whole city shall flee for the no@@ ise of the hor@@ se@@ men and bo@@ w@@ men ; they shall go into th@@ ic@@ kets , and clim@@ b up upon the ro@@ cks : every city shall be for@@ sak@@ en , and not a man d@@ well there@@ in .
run ye to and f@@ ro through the streets of Jer@@ usalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places there@@ of , if ye can find a man , if there be any that execu@@ te@@ th judgment , that seek@@ eth the truth ; and I will par@@ don it .
I will get me un@@ to the great men , and will speak un@@ to them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yok@@ e , and bur@@ st the bonds .
how shall I par@@ don the@@ e for this ? TH@@ Y children have for@@ sak@@ en me , and sworn by them that are no go@@ ds : when I had f@@ ed them to the full , they then committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and assemb@@ led themselves by troops in the har@@ lots ' houses .
and the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done un@@ to them .
L@@ o , I will bring a nation upon you from far , O house of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord : it is a m@@ igh@@ ty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language th@@ ou know@@ est not , neither under@@ stan@@ dest what they say .
and they shall eat up th@@ ine har@@ v@@ est , and TH@@ Y bread , which TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters should eat : they shall eat up TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks and th@@ ine her@@ ds : they shall eat up TH@@ Y v@@ ines and TH@@ Y fi@@ g trees : they shall imp@@ over@@ ish TH@@ Y f@@ enced cities , where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ ted@@ st , with the s@@ word .
they are wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at , they sh@@ ine : ye@@ a , they over@@ pass the de@@ eds of the w@@ ic@@ ked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fa@@ ther@@ less , yet they prosp@@ er ; and the right of the ne@@ edy do they not judge .
the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds with their f@@ loc@@ ks shall come un@@ to her ; they shall pit@@ ch their ten@@ ts against her round about ; they shall fe@@ ed every one in his place .
prepare ye war against her ; arise , and let us go up at noon . Wo@@ e un@@ to us ! for the day go@@ eth away , for the shad@@ o@@ ws of the evening are stret@@ ched out .
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? be@@ hold , their e@@ ar is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can@@ not he@@ arken : be@@ hold , the word of the Lord is un@@ to them a re@@ pro@@ ach ; they have no de@@ light in it .
and their houses shall be turned un@@ to others , with their fields and wi@@ ves together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for from the least of them even un@@ to the greatest of them every one is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and from the pro@@ phe@@ t even un@@ to the pri@@ est every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
they have he@@ aled also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
hear , O ear@@ th : be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this people , even the fruit of their th@@ ou@@ ghts , because they have not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
they shall lay hold on bo@@ w and spe@@ ar ; they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy ; their voice ro@@ aret@@ h like the sea ; and they ride upon hor@@ ses , set in array as men for war against the@@ e , O daughter of Z@@ ion .
we have heard the f@@ ame there@@ of : our hands wa@@ x fe@@ e@@ ble : an@@ gu@@ ish hat@@ h taken hold of us , and p@@ ain , as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the s@@ word of the enemy and fear is on every side .
O daughter of my people , gir@@ d the@@ e with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and w@@ allow th@@ y@@ self in ashes : make the@@ e mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lament@@ ation : for the sp@@ o@@ iler shall su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come upon us .
stand in the gate of the Lord 's house , and procla@@ im there this word , and say , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , all ye of Ju@@ da@@ h , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord .
for if ye throug@@ h@@ ly amend your ways and your do@@ ings ; if ye throug@@ h@@ ly exec@@ ute judgment between a man and his neighbour ;
then will I cause you to d@@ well in this place , in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers , for ever and ever .
but go ye now un@@ to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of my people Israel .
and now , because ye have done all these works , sa@@ ith the Lord , and I sp@@ ake un@@ to you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answ@@ ered not ;
therefore will I do un@@ to this house , which is called by my name , where@@ in ye trust , and un@@ to the place which I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , as I have done to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
the children gather wood , and the fa@@ thers kin@@ dle the fire , and the women k@@ ne@@ ad their d@@ ough , to make cak@@ es to the qu@@ een of heav@@ en , and to p@@ our out drink offer@@ ings un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they may prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
for I sp@@ ake not un@@ to your fa@@ thers , nor comman@@ ded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
but this thing comman@@ ded I them , saying , obe@@ y my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have comman@@ ded you , that it may be well un@@ to you .
since the day that your fa@@ thers came forth out of the land of Egypt un@@ to this day I have even sent un@@ to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , daily rising up early and sending them :
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt speak all these words un@@ to them ; but they will not he@@ arken to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt also call un@@ to them ; but they will not answer the@@ e .
for the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have done ev@@ il in my sight , sa@@ ith the Lord : they have set their ab@@ omin@@ ations in the house which is called by my name , to poll@@ ute it .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Top@@ he@@ t , nor the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , but the val@@ ley of sla@@ ughter : for they shall bur@@ y in Top@@ he@@ t , ti@@ ll there be no place .
and the car@@ cases of this people shall be meat for the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and for the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th ; and none shall fra@@ y them away .
then will I cause to ce@@ ase from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the streets of Jer@@ usalem , the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de : for the land shall be de@@ so@@ late .
at that time , sa@@ ith the Lord , they shall bring out the b@@ ones of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the b@@ ones of his pr@@ inces , and the b@@ ones of the pri@@ ests , and the b@@ ones of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the b@@ ones of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , out of their graves :
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due of them that remain of this ev@@ il family , which remain in all the places w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
I hear@@ ken@@ ed and heard , but they sp@@ ake not ar@@ ight : no man re@@ pen@@ ted him of his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , saying , What have I done ? every one turned to his course , as the hor@@ se rus@@ het@@ h into the battle .
Ye@@ a , the stor@@ k in the heav@@ en know@@ eth her appointed times ; and the tur@@ tle and the cr@@ ane and the sw@@ allow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
how do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the Lord is with us ? L@@ o , certainly in v@@ ain made he it ; the p@@ en of the s@@ cri@@ bes is in v@@ ain .
the wise men are as@@ ha@@ med , they are dis@@ may@@ ed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wis@@ dom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wi@@ ves un@@ to others , and their fields to them that shall inher@@ it them : for every one from the least even un@@ to the greatest is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness , from the pro@@ phe@@ t even un@@ to the pri@@ est every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
for they have he@@ aled the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they as@@ ha@@ med when they had committed ab@@ omin@@ ation ? n@@ ay , they were not at all as@@ ha@@ med , neither could they b@@ lus@@ h : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall be cast down , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for , be@@ hold , I will send Ser@@ pen@@ ts , co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ces , among you , which will not be char@@ med , and they shall bi@@ te you , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment hat@@ h taken hold on me .
O@@ h that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fo@@ un@@ tain of te@@ ars , that I might we@@ ep day and night for the sla@@ in of the daughter of my people !
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
and they b@@ end their ton@@ gues like their bo@@ w for lies : but they are not val@@ i@@ ant for the truth upon the ear@@ th ; for they proceed from ev@@ il to ev@@ il , and they know not me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and they will dec@@ e@@ ive every one his neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have ta@@ ught their ton@@ gue to speak lies , and we@@ ary themselves to commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
their ton@@ gue is as an ar@@ row shot out ; it speak@@ eth dec@@ e@@ it : one speak@@ eth peac@@ e@@ ably to his neighbour with his m@@ outh , but in heart he lay@@ eth his wait .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will fe@@ ed them , even this people , with wor@@ m@@ wood , and give them water of g@@ all to drink .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them also among the he@@ a@@ then , whom neither they nor their fa@@ thers have known : and I will send a s@@ word after them , ti@@ ll I have consu@@ med them .
and let them make has@@ te , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with te@@ ars , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women , and let your e@@ ar receive the word of his m@@ outh , and te@@ ach your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters w@@ ailing , and every one her neighbour lament@@ ation .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our pal@@ aces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , Let not the wise man gl@@ ory in his wis@@ dom , neither let the m@@ igh@@ ty man gl@@ ory in his might , let not the rich man gl@@ ory in his ri@@ ches :
for the customs of the people are v@@ ain : for one cut@@ te@@ th a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man , with the ax@@ e .
they are u@@ pri@@ ght as the pal@@ m tree , but speak not : they must needs be bor@@ ne , because they can@@ not go . be not afraid of them ; for they can@@ not do ev@@ il , neither also is it in them to do good .
who would not fear the@@ e , O King of nations ? for to the@@ e do@@ th it ap@@ per@@ tain : for@@ as@@ much as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , there is none like un@@ to the@@ e .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the work@@ man , and of the hands of the founder : blue and pur@@ ple is their clo@@ thing : they are all the work of c@@ un@@ ning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an ever@@ lasting king : at his wr@@ ath the ear@@ th shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his in@@ dign@@ ation .
he hat@@ h made the ear@@ th by his power , he hat@@ h established the world by his wis@@ dom , and hat@@ h stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens by his discre@@ tion .
when he ut@@ ter@@ eth his voice , there is a multi@@ tude of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings with rain , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth the wind out of his treasures .
every man is bru@@ tish in his knowledge : every founder is con@@ founded by the Gra@@ ven image : for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the ro@@ d of his inher@@ it@@ ance : the Lord of hosts is his name .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is sp@@ o@@ iled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for the p@@ ast@@ ors are become bru@@ tish , and have not sought the Lord : therefore they shall not prosp@@ er , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks shall be sc@@ at@@ tered .
be@@ hold , the no@@ ise of the bru@@ it is come , and a great commo@@ tion out of the north country , to make the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h de@@ so@@ late , and a den of dra@@ g@@ ons .
O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walk@@ eth to direct his steps .
p@@ our out TH@@ Y fur@@ y upon the he@@ a@@ then that know the@@ e not , and upon the families that call not on TH@@ Y name : for they have e@@ aten up Jac@@ o@@ b , and dev@@ oured him , and consu@@ med him , and have made his habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late .
then the Lord said un@@ to me , procla@@ im all these words in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem , saying , He@@ ar ye the words of this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and do them .
for I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly protested un@@ to your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even un@@ to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obe@@ y my voice .
they are turned back to the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fa@@ thers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other go@@ ds to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I made with their fa@@ thers .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry un@@ to me , I will not he@@ arken un@@ to them .
then shall the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem go , and cry un@@ to the go@@ ds un@@ to whom they offer incen@@ se : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities were TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have ye set up al@@ tar@@ s to that sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to Ba@@ al .
the Lord called TH@@ Y name , A green olive tree , fair , and of good@@ ly fruit : with the no@@ ise of a great t@@ um@@ ult he hat@@ h kin@@ d@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for the Lord of hosts , that plan@@ ted the@@ e , hat@@ h pronounced ev@@ il against the@@ e , for the ev@@ il of the house of Israel and of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , which they have done against themselves to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger in offering incen@@ se un@@ to Ba@@ al .
but , O Lord of hosts , that jud@@ gest righ@@ te@@ ously , that tri@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see TH@@ Y ven@@ ge@@ ance on them : for un@@ to the@@ e have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , be@@ hold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the s@@ word ; their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall die by fam@@ ine :
and there shall be no re@@ mn@@ ant of them : for I will bring ev@@ il upon the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , even the year of their vis@@ itation .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast plan@@ ted them , ye@@ a , they have taken root : they grow , ye@@ a , they bring forth fruit : th@@ ou art near in their m@@ outh , and far from their re@@ ins .
but th@@ ou , O Lord , know@@ est me : th@@ ou h@@ ast seen me , and tried mine heart toward the@@ e : pull them out like she@@ ep for the sla@@ ughter , and prepare them for the day of sla@@ ughter .
for even TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and the house of TH@@ Y father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with the@@ e ; ye@@ a , they have called a multi@@ tude after the@@ e : believe them not , though they speak fair words un@@ to the@@ e .
I have for@@ sak@@ en mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed of my sou@@ l into the hand of her enem@@ ies .
the sp@@ o@@ ilers are come upon all high places through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : for the s@@ word of the Lord shall dev@@ our from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h shall have peace .
they have so@@ wn wheat , but shall re@@ ap thor@@ ns : they have put themselves to p@@ ain , but shall not profit : and they shall be as@@ ha@@ med of your revenues because of the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord against all mine ev@@ il neighbours , that touch the inher@@ it@@ ance which I have caused my people Israel to inher@@ it ; be@@ hold , I will p@@ lu@@ ck them out of their land , and p@@ lu@@ ck out the house of Ju@@ da@@ h from among them .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them out I will return , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
take the gir@@ dle that th@@ ou h@@ ast got , which is upon TH@@ Y lo@@ ins , and arise , go to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and hide it there in a hol@@ e of the rock .
and it came to pass after many days , that the Lord said un@@ to me , arise , go to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and take the gir@@ dle from th@@ ence , which I comman@@ ded the@@ e to hide there .
then I went to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and dig@@ ged , and took the gir@@ dle from the place where I had hi@@ d it : and , be@@ hold , the gir@@ dle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
this ev@@ il people , which refuse to hear my words , which walk in the imag@@ ination of their heart , and walk after other go@@ ds , to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this gir@@ dle , which is good for nothing .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to them this word ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , Every bot@@ tle shall be filled with wine : and they shall say un@@ to the@@ e , D@@ o we not certainly know that every bot@@ tle shall be filled with wine ?
and I will d@@ ash them one against another , even the fa@@ thers and the sons together , sa@@ ith the Lord : I will not p@@ ity , nor spar@@ e , nor have mer@@ cy , but destroy them .
give gl@@ ory to the Lord your God , before he cause d@@ ark@@ ness , and before your feet st@@ um@@ ble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross d@@ ark@@ ness .
but if ye will not hear it , my sou@@ l shall we@@ ep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall we@@ ep sor@@ e , and run down with te@@ ars , because the Lord 's flock is carried away cap@@ tive .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Ju@@ da@@ h shall be carried away cap@@ tive all of it , it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
what w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou say when he shall punish the@@ e ? for th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught them to be cap@@ tains , and as chief over the@@ e : shall not sor@@ ro@@ ws take the@@ e , as a woman in trav@@ ail ?
and if th@@ ou say in th@@ ine heart , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore come these things upon me ? for the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity are TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts discovered , and TH@@ Y he@@ els made b@@ are .
and their no@@ bles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the p@@ its , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded , and covered their heads .
because the ground is chap@@ t , for there was no rain in the ear@@ th , the p@@ low@@ men were as@@ ha@@ med , they covered their heads .
O the hope of Israel , the sa@@ vi@@ our there@@ of in time of trouble , why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou be as a st@@ ran@@ ger in the land , and as a w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man that tur@@ net@@ h aside to tar@@ ry for a night ?
why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou be as a man ast@@ on@@ ied , as a m@@ igh@@ ty man that can@@ not save ? yet th@@ ou , O Lord , art in the mid@@ st of us , and we are called by TH@@ Y name ; leave us not .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer bur@@ n@@ t offering and an ob@@ lation , I will not accept them : but I will consum@@ e them by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
and the people to whom they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y shall be cast out in the streets of Jer@@ usalem because of the fam@@ ine and the s@@ word ; and they shall have none to bur@@ y them , them , their wi@@ ves , nor their sons , nor their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for I will p@@ our their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess upon them .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt say this word un@@ to them ; Let mine eyes run down with te@@ ars night and day , and let them not ce@@ ase : for the vir@@ gin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous blow .
H@@ ast th@@ ou ut@@ ter@@ ly rejected Ju@@ da@@ h ? hat@@ h TH@@ Y sou@@ l lo@@ th@@ ed Z@@ ion ? why h@@ ast th@@ ou s@@ mit@@ ten us , and there is no he@@ aling for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of he@@ aling , and be@@ hold trouble !
then said the Lord un@@ to me , Th@@ ough Mos@@ es and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind could not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
and I will cause them to be removed into all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas : I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a sp@@ o@@ iler at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused him to fall upon it su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and terr@@ ors upon the city .
the Lord said , Ver@@ ily it shall be well with TH@@ Y re@@ mn@@ ant ; veril@@ y I will cause the enemy to ent@@ re@@ at the@@ e well in the time of ev@@ il and in the time of aff@@ li@@ ction .
TH@@ Y sub@@ stance and TH@@ Y treasures will I give to the sp@@ oil without price , and that for all TH@@ Y sin@@ s , even in all TH@@ Y borders .
TH@@ Y words were found , and I did eat them ; and TH@@ Y word was un@@ to me the joy and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing of mine heart : for I am called by TH@@ Y name , O Lord God of hosts .
and I will make the@@ e un@@ to this people a f@@ enced br@@ as@@ en wall : and they shall fight against the@@ e , but they shall not prev@@ ail against the@@ e : for I am with the@@ e to save the@@ e and to deliver the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and I will deliver the@@ e out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and I will re@@ de@@ em the@@ e out of the hand of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that b@@ are them , and concerning their fa@@ thers that beg@@ at them in this land ;
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning , to comfor@@ t them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the c@@ up of con@@ so@@ lation to drink for their father or for their mother .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will cause to ce@@ ase out of this place in your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de .
and it shall come to pass , when th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w this people all these words , and they shall say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore hat@@ h the Lord pronounced all this great ev@@ il against us ? or what is our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ?
then s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , Bec@@ ause your fa@@ thers have for@@ sak@@ en me , sa@@ ith the Lord , and have walked after other go@@ ds , and have served them , and have wor@@ shi@@ pped them , and have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have not kept my law ;
and ye have done worse than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , ye walk every one after the imag@@ ination of his ev@@ il heart , that they may not he@@ arken un@@ to me :
therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not , neither ye nor your fa@@ thers ; and there shall ye serve other go@@ ds day and night ; where I will not she@@ w you favour .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that it shall no more be said , The Lord li@@ vet@@ h , that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for mine eyes are upon all their ways : they are not hi@@ d from my face , neither is their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity hi@@ d from mine eyes .
and first I will re@@ compen@@ se their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin double ; because they have def@@ iled my land , they have filled mine inher@@ it@@ ance with the car@@ cases of their de@@ te@@ stable and ab@@ omin@@ able things .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The Lord .
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is Gra@@ ven upon the table of their heart , and upon the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
and th@@ ou , even th@@ y@@ self , s@@ halt dis@@ continue from th@@ ine heritage that I gave the@@ e ; and I will cause the@@ e to serve th@@ ine enem@@ ies in the land which th@@ ou know@@ est not : for ye have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in mine an@@ ger , which shall bur@@ n for ever .
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good co@@ me@@ th ; but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ te@@ th on eg@@ gs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ te@@ th ri@@ ches , and not by right , shall leave them in the mid@@ st of his days , and at his end shall be a fo@@ ol .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that for@@ sake the@@ e shall be as@@ ha@@ med , and they that de@@ part from me shall be written in the ear@@ th , because they have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , the fo@@ un@@ tain of living waters .
let them be con@@ founded that persec@@ ute me , but let not me be con@@ founded : let them be dis@@ may@@ ed , but let not me be dis@@ may@@ ed : bring upon them the day of ev@@ il , and destroy them with double destruction .
thus said the Lord un@@ to me ; G@@ o and stand in the gate of the children of the people , where@@ by the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h come in , and by the which they go out , and in all the gates of Jer@@ usalem ;
and say un@@ to them , He@@ ar ye the word of the Lord , ye kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and all Ju@@ da@@ h , and all the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; T@@ ake heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , and bear no burden on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jer@@ usalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , neither do ye any work , but hal@@ low ye the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , as I comman@@ ded your fa@@ thers .
and it shall come to pass , if ye dil@@ ig@@ ently he@@ arken un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , but hal@@ low the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , to do no work there@@ in ;
and they shall come from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the places about Jer@@ usalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the pla@@ in , and from the mountains , and from the south , bringing bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and meat offer@@ ings , and incen@@ se , and bringing sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of praise , un@@ to the house of the Lord .
then I went down to the P@@ ot@@ ter 's house , and , be@@ hold , he w@@ rought a work on the whe@@ els .
and the ves@@ sel that he made of cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter : so he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
at what in@@ stan@@ t I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a k@@ ing@@ dom , to p@@ lu@@ ck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ;
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do un@@ to them .
if it do ev@@ il in my sight , that it obe@@ y not my voice , then I will rep@@ ent of the good , where@@ with I said I would benefit them .
will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which co@@ me@@ th from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold flow@@ ing waters that come from another place be for@@ sak@@ en ?
because my people hat@@ h forgotten me , they have burned incen@@ se to van@@ ity , and they have caused them to st@@ um@@ ble in their ways from the ancient p@@ aths , to walk in p@@ aths , in a way not cast up ;
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will she@@ w them the back , and not the face , in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity .
therefore deliver up their children to the fam@@ ine , and p@@ our out their blood by the force of the s@@ word ; and let their wi@@ ves be ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of their children , and be wi@@ dows ; and let their men be put to death ; let their young men be sla@@ in by the s@@ word in battle .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when th@@ ou s@@ halt bring a troop su@@ d@@ den@@ ly upon them : for they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it to take me , and hi@@ d s@@ nar@@ es for my feet .
and go forth un@@ to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the east gate , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell the@@ e ,
they have built also the high places of Ba@@ al , to bur@@ n their sons with fire for bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to Ba@@ al , which I comman@@ ded not , nor sp@@ ake it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that this place shall no more be called Top@@ he@@ t , nor The val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , but The val@@ ley of sla@@ ughter .
and I will make vo@@ id the coun@@ sel of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the s@@ word before their enem@@ ies , and by the hands of them that seek their lives : and their car@@ cases will I give to be meat for the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and for the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and I will cause them to eat the f@@ les@@ h of their sons and the f@@ les@@ h of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and they shall eat every one the f@@ les@@ h of his friend in the siege and stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with their enem@@ ies , and they that seek their lives , shall stra@@ i@@ ten them .
and the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall be def@@ iled as the place of Top@@ he@@ t , because of all the houses upon whose ro@@ of@@ s they have burned incen@@ se un@@ to all the host of heav@@ en , and have p@@ oured out drink offer@@ ings un@@ to other go@@ ds .
then came Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Top@@ he@@ t , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord had sent him to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house ; and said to all the people ,
now P@@ ash@@ ur the son of Im@@ mer the pri@@ est , who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jerem@@ i@@ ah pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied these things .
then P@@ ash@@ ur smo@@ te Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that P@@ ash@@ ur brought forth Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the sto@@ cks . then said Jerem@@ i@@ ah un@@ to him , The Lord hat@@ h not called TH@@ Y name P@@ ash@@ ur , but Mag@@ or @@@ -@@ @ mis@@ sa@@ bi@@ b .
moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the la@@ bour@@ s there@@ of , and all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things there@@ of , and all the treasures of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , which shall sp@@ oil them , and take them , and carry them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
but the Lord is with me as a m@@ igh@@ ty ter@@ ri@@ ble one : therefore my persec@@ ut@@ ors shall st@@ um@@ ble , and they shall not prev@@ ail : they shall be greatly as@@ ha@@ med ; for they shall not prosp@@ er : their ever@@ lasting conf@@ usion shall never be forgotten .
but , O Lord of hosts , that tri@@ est the righ@@ te@@ ous , and se@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see TH@@ Y ven@@ ge@@ ance on them : for un@@ to the@@ e have I opened my cause .
and let that man be as the cities which the Lord over@@ threw , and re@@ pen@@ ted not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the sh@@ ou@@ ting at no@@ on@@ ti@@ de ;
because he sle@@ w me not from the w@@ om@@ b ; or that my mother might have been my grave , and her w@@ om@@ b to be always great with me .
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , when king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah sent un@@ to him P@@ ash@@ ur the son of Mel@@ chi@@ ah , and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , saying ,
inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , of the Lord for us ; for Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on mak@@ eth war against us ; if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all his won@@ dro@@ us works , that he may go up from us .
and I myself will fight against you with an out@@ stret@@ ched hand and with a strong arm , even in an@@ ger , and in fur@@ y , and in great wr@@ ath .
he that abi@@ de@@ th in this city shall die by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : but he that go@@ eth out , and fal@@ le@@ th to the Chal@@ de@@ ans that bes@@ i@@ ege you , he shall live , and his life shall be un@@ to him for a pre@@ y .
for I have set my face against this city for ev@@ il , and not for good , sa@@ ith the Lord : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall bur@@ n it with fire .
be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , O inhabi@@ tant of the val@@ ley , and rock of the pla@@ in , sa@@ ith the Lord ; which say , Wh@@ o shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habi@@ tations ?
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your do@@ ings , sa@@ ith the Lord : and I will kin@@ dle a fire in the forest there@@ of , and it shall dev@@ our all things round about it .
and say , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , O king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sit@@ test upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y servants , and TH@@ Y people that enter in by these gates :
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , ri@@ ding in char@@ i@@ ots and on hor@@ ses , he , and his servants , and his people .
and I will prepare destro@@ yers against the@@ e , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down TH@@ Y choice c@@ ed@@ ars , and cast them into the fire .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord tou@@ ching S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , which re@@ ig@@ ned instead of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , which went forth out of this place ; He shall not return th@@ ither any more :
Wo@@ e un@@ to him that buil@@ de@@ th his house by un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and his ch@@ ambers by wrong ; that us@@ eth his neighbour 's service without wages , and gi@@ vet@@ h him not for his work ;
and I will give the@@ e into the hand of them that seek TH@@ Y life , and into the hand of them whose face th@@ ou fear@@ est , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
and I will cast the@@ e out , and TH@@ Y mother that b@@ are the@@ e , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken i@@ dol ? is he a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure ? where@@ fore are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all countries w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and increase .
and I will set up she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds over them which shall fe@@ ed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , neither shall they be lacking , sa@@ ith the Lord .
in his days Ju@@ da@@ h shall be sav@@ ed , and Israel shall d@@ well saf@@ ely : and this is his name where@@ by he shall be called , the Lord our R@@ IG@@ H@@ TE@@ O@@ U@@ SN@@ ESS .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that they shall no more say , The Lord li@@ vet@@ h , which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for the land is full of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of swe@@ aring the land mour@@ net@@ h ; the pleas@@ ant places of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness are dri@@ ed up , and their course is ev@@ il , and their force is not right .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore their way shall be un@@ to them as sli@@ p@@ per@@ y ways in the d@@ ark@@ ness : they shall be driven on , and fall there@@ in : for I will bring ev@@ il upon them , even the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; be@@ hold , I will fe@@ ed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all : for from the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Jer@@ usalem is prof@@ an@@ eness gone forth into all the land .
they say still un@@ to them that desp@@ ise me , The Lord hat@@ h said , Y@@ e shall have peace ; and they say un@@ to every one that walk@@ eth after the imag@@ ination of his own heart , No ev@@ il shall come upon you .
for who hat@@ h stood in the coun@@ sel of the Lord , and hat@@ h perceived and heard his word ? who hat@@ h marked his word , and heard it ?
be@@ hold , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind of the Lord is gone forth in fur@@ y , even a gri@@ ev@@ ous wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it shall fall gri@@ ev@@ ously upon the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and ti@@ ll he have performed the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
but if they had stood in my coun@@ sel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
how long shall this be in the heart of the pro@@ ph@@ ets that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y lies ? ye@@ a , they are pro@@ ph@@ ets of the dec@@ e@@ it of their own heart ;
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dre@@ ams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fa@@ thers have forgotten my name for Ba@@ al .
the pro@@ phe@@ t that hat@@ h a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hat@@ h my word , let him speak my word fa@@ ith@@ fully . what is the c@@ haf@@ f to the wheat ? sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have per@@ ver@@ ted the words of the living God , of the Lord of hosts our God .
but since ye say , The burden of the Lord ; therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; Bec@@ ause ye say this word , The burden of the Lord , and I have sent un@@ to you , saying , Y@@ e shall not say , The burden of the Lord ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I , even I , will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will for@@ sake you , and the city that I gave you and your fa@@ thers , and cast you out of my presence :
one bas@@ ket had very good fig@@ s , even like the fig@@ s that are first ri@@ pe : and the other bas@@ ket had very na@@ ug@@ h@@ ty fig@@ s , which could not be e@@ aten , they were so bad .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; L@@ ike these good fig@@ s , so will I acknowledge them that are carried away cap@@ tive of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans for their good .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not p@@ lu@@ ck them up .
and I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the Lord : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return un@@ to me with their whole heart .
and I will deliver them to be removed into all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th for their hurt , to be a re@@ pro@@ ach and a pro@@ ver@@ b , a ta@@ un@@ t and a cur@@ se , in all places w@@ hi@@ ther I shall drive them .
and I will send the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , among them , ti@@ ll they be consu@@ med from off the land that I gave un@@ to them and to their fa@@ thers .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
from the thir@@ teen@@ th year of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Ju@@ da@@ h , even un@@ to this day , that is the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , the word of the Lord hat@@ h come un@@ to me , and I have spoken un@@ to you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed .
and the Lord hat@@ h sent un@@ to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear .
they said , Tur@@ n ye again now every one from his ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and d@@ well in the land that the Lord hat@@ h given un@@ to you and to your fa@@ thers for ever and ever :
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the cand@@ le .
and it shall come to pass , when sev@@ enty years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and that nation , sa@@ ith the Lord , for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and will make it perpet@@ ual de@@ so@@ lations .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jerem@@ i@@ ah hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and I will re@@ compen@@ se them according to their de@@ eds , and according to the works of their own hands .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel un@@ to me ; T@@ ake the wine c@@ up of this fur@@ y at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send the@@ e , to drink it .
and they shall drink , and be moved , and be ma@@ d , because of the s@@ word that I will send among them .
then took I the c@@ up at the Lord 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , un@@ to whom the Lord had sent me :
to w@@ it , Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the kings there@@ of , and the pr@@ inces there@@ of , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se ; as it is this day ;
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and all his people ;
and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Az@@ z@@ ah , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and all the kings of Z@@ id@@ on , and the kings of the is@@ les which are beyond the sea ,
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the min@@ g@@ led people that d@@ well in the de@@ sert ,
and all the kings of Z@@ im@@ ri , and all the kings of E@@ lam , and all the kings of the Me@@ des ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are upon the face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the c@@ up at th@@ ine hand to drink , then s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; Y@@ e shall certainly drink .
a no@@ ise shall come even to the ends of the ear@@ th ; for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with the nations , he will p@@ lead with all f@@ les@@ h ; he will give them that are w@@ ic@@ ked to the s@@ word , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the sla@@ in of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the ear@@ th even un@@ to the other end of the ear@@ th : they shall not be lamen@@ ted , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be D@@ ung upon the ground .
H@@ ow@@ l , ye she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and cry ; and w@@ allow yo@@ ur@@ selves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your sla@@ ughter and of your disper@@ sions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleas@@ ant ves@@ sel .
and the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and an ho@@ w@@ ling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled their pas@@ ture .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h came this word from the Lord , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; St@@ and in the court of the Lord 's house , and speak un@@ to all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , which come to worship in the Lord 's house , all the words that I command the@@ e to speak un@@ to them ; dimin@@ ish not a word :
if so be they will he@@ arken , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way , that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il , which I purpose to do un@@ to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; If ye will not he@@ arken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to he@@ arken to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I sent un@@ to you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed ;
now it came to pass , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had comman@@ ded him to speak un@@ to all the people , that the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people took him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely die .
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house un@@ to the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
then sp@@ ake Jerem@@ i@@ ah un@@ to all the pr@@ inces and to all the people , saying , The Lord sent me to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your do@@ ings , and obe@@ y the voice of the Lord your God ; and the Lord will rep@@ ent him of the ev@@ il that he hat@@ h pronounced against you .
then rose up certain of the el@@ ders of the land , and sp@@ ake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the pr@@ inces , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king sent men into Egypt , name@@ ly , El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and certain men with him into Egypt .
and they f@@ et@@ ched forth U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him un@@ to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king ; who sle@@ w him with the s@@ word , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the hand of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an was with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h came this word un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and to the king of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and to the king of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and to the king of Z@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers which come to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and command them to say un@@ to their mas@@ ters , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say un@@ to your mas@@ ters ;
I have made the ear@@ th , the man and the be@@ ast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and have given it un@@ to whom it seemed meet un@@ to me .
and now have I given all these lands un@@ to the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the be@@ asts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
and all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
therefore he@@ arken not ye to your pro@@ ph@@ ets , nor to your di@@ vin@@ ers , nor to your dre@@ am@@ ers , nor to your en@@ chan@@ ters , nor to your sor@@ cer@@ ers , which speak un@@ to you , saying , Y@@ e shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie un@@ to you , to remove you far from your land ; and that I should drive you out , and ye should per@@ ish .
why will ye die , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y people , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , as the Lord hat@@ h spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ?
therefore he@@ arken not un@@ to the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ets that speak un@@ to you , saying , Y@@ e shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie un@@ to you .
for I have not sent them , sa@@ ith the Lord , yet they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie in my name ; that I might drive you out , and that ye might per@@ ish , ye , and the pro@@ ph@@ ets that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y un@@ to you .
Ye@@ a , thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and of Jer@@ usalem ;
and it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ ur the pro@@ phe@@ t , which was of Gi@@ be@@ on , sp@@ ake un@@ to me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the pri@@ ests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried them to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
and I will bring again to this place J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h , with all the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , that went into Bab@@ yl@@ on , sa@@ ith the Lord : for I will break the yok@@ e of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah in the presence of the pri@@ ests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord ,
nevertheless hear th@@ ou now this word that I speak in th@@ ine e@@ ars , and in the e@@ ars of all the people ;
the pro@@ phe@@ t which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth of peace , when the word of the pro@@ phe@@ t shall come to pass , then shall the pro@@ phe@@ t be known , that the Lord hat@@ h truly sent him .
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the yok@@ e from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
( after that J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the king , and the qu@@ een , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and the car@@ pen@@ ters , and the S@@ mi@@ ths , were depar@@ ted from Jer@@ usalem ; )
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , un@@ to all that are carried away cap@@ tives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
take ye wi@@ ves , and be@@ get sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and take wi@@ ves for your sons , and give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to hus@@ bands , that they may bear sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; that ye may be increased there , and not dimin@@ ished .
and seek the peace of the city w@@ hi@@ ther I have caused you to be carried away cap@@ tives , and pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord for it : for in the peace there@@ of shall ye have peace .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Let not your pro@@ ph@@ ets and your di@@ vin@@ ers , that be in the mid@@ st of you , dec@@ e@@ ive you , neither he@@ arken to your dre@@ ams which ye cause to be dre@@ amed .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , That after sev@@ enty years be accomplished at Bab@@ yl@@ on I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
know that thus sa@@ ith the Lord of the king that sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , and of all the people that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in this city , and of your bre@@ th@@ ren that are not gone forth with you into cap@@ tivity ;
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; be@@ hold , I will send upon them the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and will make them like v@@ ile fig@@ s , that can@@ not be e@@ aten , they are so ev@@ il .
because they have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to my words , sa@@ ith the Lord , which I sent un@@ to them by my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ; but ye would not hear , sa@@ ith the Lord .
because they have committed vil@@ lan@@ y in Israel , and have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with their neighbours ' wi@@ ves , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded them ; even I know , and am a witness , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast sent letters in TH@@ Y name un@@ to all the people that are at Jer@@ usalem , and to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and to all the pri@@ ests , saying ,
the Lord hat@@ h made the@@ e pri@@ est in the stead of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is ma@@ d , and mak@@ eth himself a pro@@ phe@@ t , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest put him in prison , and in the sto@@ cks .
send to all them of the cap@@ tivity , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord concerning Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the Ne@@ he@@ lam@@ ite ; Bec@@ ause that Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied un@@ to you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
ask ye now , and see whether a man do@@ th trav@@ ail with child ? where@@ fore do I see every man with his hands on his lo@@ ins , as a woman in trav@@ ail , and all faces are turned into pal@@ eness ?
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , that I will break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and will bur@@ st TH@@ Y bonds , and st@@ ran@@ gers shall no more serve themselves of him :
all TH@@ Y lov@@ ers have forgotten the@@ e ; they seek the@@ e not ; for I have wounded the@@ e with the wo@@ und of an enemy , with the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of a cru@@ el one , for the multi@@ tude of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; because TH@@ Y sin@@ s were increased .
why cri@@ est th@@ ou for th@@ ine aff@@ li@@ ction ? TH@@ Y sor@@ row is inc@@ ur@@ able for the multi@@ tude of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : because TH@@ Y sin@@ s were increased , I have done these things un@@ to the@@ e .
therefore all they that dev@@ our the@@ e shall be dev@@ oured ; and all th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries , every one of them , shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and they that sp@@ oil the@@ e shall be a sp@@ oil , and all that pre@@ y upon the@@ e will I give for a pre@@ y .
for I will restore health un@@ to the@@ e , and I will he@@ al the@@ e of TH@@ Y wounds , sa@@ ith the Lord ; because they called the@@ e an out@@ cast , saying , This is Z@@ ion , whom no man seek@@ eth after .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b 's ten@@ ts , and have mer@@ cy on his d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places ; and the city shall be buil@@ ded upon her own he@@ ap , and the palace shall remain after the manner there@@ of .
and out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of them that make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
be@@ hold , the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind of the Lord go@@ eth forth with fur@@ y , a continuing wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it shall fall with p@@ ain upon the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , The people which were left of the s@@ word found grace in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; even Israel , when I went to cause him to rest .
the Lord hat@@ h appeared of old un@@ to me , saying , Ye@@ a , I have lov@@ ed the@@ e with an ever@@ lasting love : therefore with lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness have I drawn the@@ e .
again I will build the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be built , O vir@@ gin of Israel : th@@ ou s@@ halt again be ad@@ or@@ ned with TH@@ Y tab@@ re@@ ts , and s@@ halt go forth in the dan@@ ces of them that make mer@@ ry .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt yet plant v@@ ines upon the mountains of Samar@@ ia : the plan@@ ters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
for there shall be a day , that the watch@@ men upon the mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall cry , arise ye , and let us go up to Z@@ ion un@@ to the Lord our God .
hear the word of the Lord , O ye nations , and declare it in the is@@ les af@@ ar off , and say , He that sc@@ at@@ tered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d do@@ th his flock .
then shall the vir@@ gin re@@ jo@@ ice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfor@@ t them , and make them re@@ jo@@ ice from their sor@@ row .
and I will s@@ ati@@ ate the sou@@ l of the pri@@ ests with fat@@ ness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Go@@ od@@ ness , sa@@ ith the Lord .
I have su@@ rely heard E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im b@@ emo@@ an@@ ing himself thus ; T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed me , and I was ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed , as a bul@@ lock un@@ acc@@ ust@@ o@@ med to the yok@@ e : turn th@@ ou me , and I shall be turned ; for th@@ ou art the Lord my God .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I smo@@ te upon my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , ye@@ a , even con@@ founded , because I did bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
and there shall d@@ well in Ju@@ da@@ h itself , and in all the cities there@@ of together , hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , and they that go forth with f@@ loc@@ ks .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of be@@ ast .
and it shall come to pass , that like as I have watched over them , to p@@ lu@@ ck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to aff@@ lic@@ t ; so will I watch over them , to build , and to plant , sa@@ ith the Lord .
in those days they shall say no more , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten a s@@ our gra@@ pe , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge .
but every one shall die for his own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : every man that e@@ ate@@ th the s@@ our gra@@ pe , his te@@ eth shall be set on edge .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h :
not according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I made with their fa@@ thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant they br@@ ake , although I was an husband un@@ to them , sa@@ ith the Lord :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; If heav@@ en above can be meas@@ ured , and the foundations of the ear@@ th searched out ben@@ e@@ ath , I will also cast off all the se@@ ed of Israel for all that they have done , sa@@ ith the Lord .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that the city shall be built to the Lord from the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el un@@ to the gate of the cor@@ ner .
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill G@@ are@@ b , and shall comp@@ ass about to Go@@ ath .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord in the tenth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , which was the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar .
for then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Jer@@ usalem : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h 's house .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall su@@ rely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and shall speak with him m@@ outh to m@@ outh , and his eyes shall be@@ hold his eyes ;
and he shall lead Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and there shall he be until I visit him , sa@@ ith the Lord : though ye fight with the Chal@@ de@@ ans , ye shall not prosp@@ er ?
and I subscri@@ bed the evidence , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balan@@ ces .
so I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and cust@@ om , and that which was open :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; T@@ ake these evi@@ den@@ ces , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel , that they may continue many days .
now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , I pray@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , saying ,
A@@ h Lord God ! be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast made the heav@@ en and the ear@@ th by TH@@ Y great power and stret@@ ched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for the@@ e :
T@@ ho@@ u she@@ west lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to thousands , and re@@ compens@@ est the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers into the bos@@ om of their children after them : the Great , the m@@ igh@@ ty God , the Lord of hosts , is his name ,
great in coun@@ sel , and m@@ igh@@ ty in work : for th@@ ine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
which h@@ ast set signs and won@@ ders in the land of Egypt , even un@@ to this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and h@@ ast made the@@ e a name , as at this day ;
and h@@ ast brought forth TH@@ Y people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with great terror ;
and h@@ ast given them this land , which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st swe@@ ar to their fa@@ thers to give them , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ;
and they came in , and poss@@ essed it ; but they obe@@ yed not TH@@ Y voice , neither walked in TH@@ Y law ; they have done nothing of all that th@@ ou comman@@ de@@ d@@ st them to do : therefore th@@ ou h@@ ast caused all this ev@@ il to come upon them :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have only done ev@@ il before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to an@@ ger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for this city hat@@ h been to me as a provoc@@ ation of mine an@@ ger and of my fur@@ y from the day that they built it even un@@ to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
and they have turned un@@ to me the back , and not the face : though I ta@@ ught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to receive in@@ struction .
be@@ hold , I will gather them out of all countries , w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them in mine an@@ ger , and in my fur@@ y , and in great wr@@ ath ; and I will bring them again un@@ to this place , and I will cause them to d@@ well saf@@ ely :
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
and I will make an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hear@@ ts , that they shall not de@@ part from me .
Ye@@ a , I will re@@ jo@@ ice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assu@@ red@@ ly with my whole heart and with my whole sou@@ l .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which are thrown down by the moun@@ ts , and by the s@@ word ;
and I will cause the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h and the cap@@ tivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
and I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned , and where@@ by they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; A@@ gain in this place , which is de@@ so@@ late without man and without be@@ ast , and in all the cities there@@ of , shall be an habi@@ tation of she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds causing their f@@ loc@@ ks to lie down .
in the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the val@@ e , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jer@@ usalem , and in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall the f@@ loc@@ ks pass again under the hands of him that tel@@ le@@ th them , sa@@ ith the Lord .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised un@@ to the house of Israel and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in those days shall Ju@@ da@@ h be sav@@ ed , and Jer@@ usalem shall d@@ well saf@@ ely : and this is the name where@@ with she shall be called , The Lord our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
as the host of heav@@ en can@@ not be num@@ ber@@ ed , neither the s@@ and of the sea meas@@ ured : so will I multi@@ ply the se@@ ed of David my ser@@ vant , and the L@@ evi@@ tes that minister un@@ to me .
Con@@ si@@ der@@ est th@@ ou not what this people have spoken , saying , The two families which the Lord hat@@ h chosen , he hat@@ h even cast them off ? thus they have desp@@ ised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and all his army , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th of his domin@@ ion , and all the people , fought against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities there@@ of , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; G@@ o and speak to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and tell him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall bur@@ n it with fire :
when the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army fought against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish , and against Az@@ ek@@ ah : for these def@@ enced cities remained of the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
this is the word that came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people which were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty un@@ to them ;
that every man should let his man@@ ser@@ vant , and every man his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , being an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w or an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to w@@ it , of a J@@ ew his brother .
but after@@ ward they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; I made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ d@@ men , saying ,
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , which hat@@ h been sold un@@ to the@@ e ; and when he hat@@ h served the@@ e six years , th@@ ou s@@ halt let him go free from the@@ e : but your fa@@ thers hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to me , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar .
but ye turned and pollu@@ ted my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom ye had set at liber@@ ty at their pleas@@ ure , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection , to be un@@ to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h and his pr@@ inces will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army , which are gone up from you .
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
go un@@ to the house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes , and speak un@@ to them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the ch@@ ambers , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hab@@ az@@ in@@ i@@ ah , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes ;
thus have we obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b our father in all that he hat@@ h charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , nor our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
but we have d@@ wel@@ t in ten@@ ts , and have obe@@ yed , and done according to all that Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b our father comman@@ ded us .
but it came to pass , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up into the land , that we said , C@@ ome , and let us go to Jer@@ usalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syri@@ ans : so we d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
because the sons of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b have performed the comman@@ d@@ ment of their father , which he comman@@ ded them ; but this people hat@@ h not hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me :
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that this word came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
take the@@ e a rol@@ l of a book , and write there@@ in all the words that I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e against Israel , and against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against all the nations , from the day I sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , from the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , even un@@ to this day .
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do un@@ to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah : and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken un@@ to him , upon a rol@@ l of a book .
therefore go th@@ ou , and read in the rol@@ l , which th@@ ou h@@ ast written from my m@@ outh , the words of the Lord in the e@@ ars of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fas@@ ting day : and also th@@ ou s@@ halt read them in the e@@ ars of all Ju@@ da@@ h that come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord , and will return every one from his ev@@ il way : for great is the an@@ ger and the fur@@ y that the Lord hat@@ h pronounced against this people .
and Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah did according to all that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t comman@@ ded him , reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jer@@ usalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h un@@ to Jer@@ usalem .
then read Bar@@ u@@ ch in the book the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house , in the e@@ ars of all the people .
when Micha@@ i@@ ah the son of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord ,
then he went down into the king 's house , into the s@@ cri@@ be 's chamber : and , lo , all the pr@@ inces sat there , even E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and all the pr@@ inces .
then Micha@@ i@@ ah declared un@@ to them all the words that he had heard , when Bar@@ u@@ ch read the book in the e@@ ars of the people .
therefore all the pr@@ inces sent J@@ eh@@ udi the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , the son of C@@ us@@ hi , un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch , saying , T@@ ake in th@@ ine hand the rol@@ l where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast read in the e@@ ars of the people , and come . so Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah took the rol@@ l in his hand , and came un@@ to them .
now it came to pass , when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one and other , and said un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch , We will su@@ rely tell the king of all these words .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the rol@@ l in the chamber of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
so the king sent J@@ eh@@ udi to f@@ et@@ ch the rol@@ l : and he took it out of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be 's chamber . and J@@ eh@@ udi read it in the e@@ ars of the king , and in the e@@ ars of all the pr@@ inces which stood bes@@ ide the king .
now the king sat in the w@@ inter@@ house in the ninth month : and there was a fire on the Hear@@ th burning before him .
yet they were not afraid , nor rent their gar@@ ments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
nevertheless El@@ na@@ than and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah had made inter@@ c@@ ession to the king that he would not bur@@ n the rol@@ l : but he would not hear them .
but the king comman@@ ded Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el the son of Ham@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Az@@ ri@@ el , and She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of Ab@@ de@@ el , to take Bar@@ u@@ ch the s@@ cri@@ be and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t : but the Lord hi@@ d them .
then the word of the Lord came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the rol@@ l , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
take the@@ e again another rol@@ l , and write in it all the former words that were in the first rol@@ l , which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king of Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h burned .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; He shall have none to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the F@@ ro@@ st .
and king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah re@@ ig@@ ned instead of Con@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made king in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did he@@ arken un@@ to the words of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
then P@@ har@@ o@@ ah 's army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chal@@ de@@ ans that bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Jer@@ usalem heard ti@@ dings of them , they depar@@ ted from Jer@@ usalem .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sent you un@@ to me to inqu@@ ire of me ; be@@ hold , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though ye had s@@ mit@@ ten the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jer@@ usalem for fear of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army ,
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the pr@@ inces were wro@@ th with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be : for they had made that the prison .
where are now your pro@@ ph@@ ets which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied un@@ to you , saying , The king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
therefore hear now , I pra@@ y the@@ e , O my lor@@ d the king : let my supp@@ lic@@ ation , I pra@@ y the@@ e , be accepted before the@@ e ; that th@@ ou cause me not to return to the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be , lest I die there .
then She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Mat@@ tan , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , and Ju@@ cal the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and P@@ ash@@ ur the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah , heard the words that Jerem@@ i@@ ah had spoken un@@ to all the people , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , He that remain@@ eth in this city shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : but he that go@@ eth forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a pre@@ y , and shall live .
then took they Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and cast him into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on of Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Ham@@ me@@ le@@ ch , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds . and in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on there was no water , but m@@ ire : so Jerem@@ i@@ ah sun@@ k in the m@@ ire .
now when E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian , one of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
my lor@@ d the king , these men have done ev@@ il in all that they have done to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , whom they have cast into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
so E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treas@@ ury , and took th@@ ence old cast cl@@ outs and old rot@@ ten ra@@ gs , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on to Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and the king said un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , I will ask the@@ e a thing ; hide nothing from me .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not go forth to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall bur@@ n it with fire , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not escape out of their hand .
but Jerem@@ i@@ ah said , They shall not deliver the@@ e . obe@@ y , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the voice of the Lord , which I speak un@@ to the@@ e : so it shall be well un@@ to the@@ e , and TH@@ Y sou@@ l shall live .
so they shall bring out all TH@@ Y wi@@ ves and TH@@ Y children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not escape out of their hand , but s@@ halt be taken by the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause this city to be burned with fire .
but if the pr@@ inces hear that I have talked with the@@ e , and they come un@@ to the@@ e , and say un@@ to the@@ e , declare un@@ to us now what th@@ ou h@@ ast said un@@ to the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put the@@ e to death ; also what the king said un@@ to the@@ e :
then th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , I presented my supp@@ lic@@ ation before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jon@@ athan 's house , to die there .
then came all the pr@@ inces un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and asked him : and he told them according to all these words that the king had comman@@ ded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
so Jerem@@ i@@ ah abo@@ de in the court of the prison until the day that Jer@@ usalem was taken : and he was there when Jer@@ usalem was taken .
in the ninth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on and all his army against Jer@@ usalem , and they bes@@ e@@ ig@@ ed it .
and in the ele@@ venth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
and it came to pass , that when Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king of Ju@@ da@@ h saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's gar@@ den , by the gate bet@@ wi@@ xt the two walls : and he went out the way of the pla@@ in .
but the Chal@@ de@@ ans ' army pursu@@ ed after them , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in R@@ ib@@ lah before his eyes : also the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on sle@@ w all the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h .
moreover he put out Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah 's eyes , and bound him with cha@@ ins , to carry him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the Chal@@ de@@ ans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and br@@ ake down the walls of Jer@@ usalem .
then Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
so Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard sent , and N@@ eb@@ us@@ has@@ ban , Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ sar@@ is , and Ner@@ gal @@@ -@@ @ shar@@ ez@@ er , R@@ ab@@ ma@@ g , and all the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces ;
even they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
now the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
but I will deliver the@@ e in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not be given into the hand of the men of whom th@@ ou art afraid .
for I will su@@ rely deliver the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not fall by the s@@ word , but TH@@ Y life shall be for a pre@@ y un@@ to the@@ e : because th@@ ou h@@ ast put TH@@ Y trust in me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in cha@@ ins among all that were carried away cap@@ tive of Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , which were carried away cap@@ tive un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am governor in the land , and had committed un@@ to him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
then they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an and Jon@@ athan the sons of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th , and the sons of Ep@@ hai the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of a Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , they and their men .
as for me , be@@ hold , I will d@@ well at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans , which will come un@@ to us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fru@@ its , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and d@@ well in your cities that ye have taken .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Mo@@ a@@ b , and among the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and in E@@ dom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left a re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
even all the Jews returned out of all places w@@ hi@@ ther they were driven , and came to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , un@@ to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and gathered wine and summer fru@@ its very much .
moreover Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were in the fields , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ,
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal , and the pr@@ inces of the king , even ten men with him , came un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and there they did eat bread together in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
then ar@@ ose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and the ten men that were with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the s@@ word , and sle@@ w him , whom the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made governor over the land .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also sle@@ w all the Jews that were with him , even with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were found there , and the men of war .
and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said un@@ to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
and it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah sle@@ w them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gi@@ be@@ on .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el had carried away cap@@ tive from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah cast about and returned , and went un@@ to Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t said un@@ to them , I have heard you ; be@@ hold , I will pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it un@@ to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
then they said to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , The Lord be a true and fa@@ ith@@ ful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall send the@@ e to us .
whether it be good , or whether it be ev@@ il , we will obe@@ y the voice of the Lord our God , to whom we send the@@ e ; that it may be well with us , when we obe@@ y the voice of the Lord our God .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not p@@ lu@@ ck you up : for I rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il that I have done un@@ to you .
be not afraid of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , sa@@ ith the Lord : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
and now therefore hear the word of the Lord , ye re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wh@@ ol@@ ly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to so@@ jour@@ n there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the s@@ word , which ye fear@@ ed , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt , and the fam@@ ine , where@@ of ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; they shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : and none of them shall remain or escape from the ev@@ il that I will bring upon them .
for ye dis@@ sem@@ b@@ led in your hear@@ ts , when ye sent me un@@ to the Lord your God , saying , pra@@ y for us un@@ to the Lord our God ; and according un@@ to all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare un@@ to us , and we will do it .
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , in the place w@@ hi@@ ther ye desire to go and to so@@ jour@@ n .
and it came to pass , that when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking un@@ to all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah set@@ te@@ th the@@ e on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , that were returned from all nations , w@@ hi@@ ther they had been driven , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in th@@ ine hand , and hide them in the cla@@ y in the bri@@ ck@@ kil@@ n , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and when he co@@ me@@ th , he shall sm@@ ite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity ; and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the Jews which d@@ well in the land of Egypt , which d@@ well at Mig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at N@@ op@@ h , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I sent un@@ to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising early and sending them , saying , O@@ h , do not this ab@@ omin@@ able thing that I h@@ ate .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore my fur@@ y and mine an@@ ger was p@@ oured forth , and was kin@@ d@@ led in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ; and they are was@@ ted and de@@ so@@ late , as at this day .
have ye forgotten the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your fa@@ thers , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their wi@@ ves , and your own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your wi@@ ves , which they have committed in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even un@@ to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish them that d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce :
then all the men which knew that their wi@@ ves had burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and all the women that stood by , a great multi@@ tude , even all the people that d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Egypt , in P@@ ath@@ ros , answ@@ ered Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
as for the word that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken un@@ to us in the name of the Lord , we will not he@@ arken un@@ to the@@ e .
but since we left off to bur@@ n incen@@ se to the qu@@ een of heav@@ en , and to p@@ our out drink offer@@ ings un@@ to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
so that the Lord could no longer bear , because of the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and because of the ab@@ omin@@ ations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a de@@ so@@ lation , and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and a cur@@ se , without an inhabi@@ tant , as at this day .
be@@ hold , I will watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good : and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h that are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until there be an end of them .
the word that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t sp@@ ake un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , when he had written these words in a book at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to him , The Lord sa@@ ith thus ; be@@ hold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have plan@@ ted I will p@@ lu@@ ck up , even this whole land .
against Egypt , against the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have I seen them dis@@ may@@ ed and turned away back ? and their m@@ igh@@ ty ones are beaten down , and are fled Ap@@ ace , and look not back : for fear was round about , sa@@ ith the Lord .
Egypt ris@@ eth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he sa@@ ith , I will go up , and will cover the ear@@ th ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants there@@ of .
come up , ye hor@@ ses ; and ra@@ ge , ye char@@ i@@ ots ; and let the m@@ igh@@ ty men come forth ; the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians and the Lib@@ y@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ di@@ ans , that handle and b@@ end the bo@@ w .
the nations have heard of TH@@ Y sh@@ ame , and TH@@ Y cry hat@@ h filled the land : for the m@@ igh@@ ty man hat@@ h stumb@@ led against the m@@ igh@@ ty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the Lord sp@@ ake to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , how Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on should come and sm@@ ite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Mig@@ dol , and publish in N@@ op@@ h and in Tah@@ pan@@ hes : say ye , St@@ and fast , and prepare the@@ e ; for the s@@ word shall dev@@ our round about the@@ e .
he made many to fall , ye@@ a , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nati@@ vity , from the op@@ pressing s@@ word .
also her hired men are in the mid@@ st of her like fat@@ ted bul@@ loc@@ ks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity was come upon them , and the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice there@@ of shall go like a ser@@ p@@ ent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with ax@@ es , as he@@ wers of wood .
the daughter of Egypt shall be con@@ founded ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith ; be@@ hold , I will punish the multi@@ tude of No , and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and Egypt , with their go@@ ds , and their kings ; even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of his servants : and after@@ ward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , sa@@ ith the Lord .
but fear not th@@ ou , O my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b , and be not dis@@ may@@ ed , O Israel : for , be@@ hold , I will save the@@ e from af@@ ar off , and TH@@ Y se@@ ed from the land of their cap@@ tivity ; and Jac@@ o@@ b shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong hor@@ ses , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , and at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers shall not look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
for in the going up of Lu@@ hit@@ h contin@@ ual we@@ eping shall go up ; for in the going down of Hor@@ on@@ aim the enem@@ ies have heard a cry of destruction .
and the sp@@ o@@ iler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the val@@ ley also shall per@@ ish , and the pla@@ in shall be destroyed , as the Lord hat@@ h spoken .
Cur@@ sed be he that do@@ eth the work of the Lord dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully , and Cur@@ sed be he that keep@@ eth back his s@@ word from blood .
Mo@@ a@@ b hat@@ h been at ease from his youth , and he hat@@ h settled on his le@@ es , and hat@@ h not been emp@@ tied from ves@@ sel to ves@@ sel , neither hat@@ h he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his tas@@ te remained in him , and his s@@ cent is not changed .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will send un@@ to him w@@ ander@@ ers , that shall cause him to w@@ ander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bott@@ les .
and judgment is come upon the pla@@ in country ; upon Hol@@ on , and upon Ja@@ haz@@ ah , and upon M@@ ep@@ ha@@ ath ,
O ye that d@@ well in Mo@@ a@@ b , leave the cities , and d@@ well in the rock , and be like the do@@ ve that mak@@ eth her n@@ est in the sides of the hol@@ e 's m@@ outh .
we have heard the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b , ( he is exceeding proud ) his lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess , and his ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy , and his pride , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of his heart .
O v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h , I will we@@ ep for the@@ e with the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er : TH@@ Y plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jaz@@ er : the sp@@ o@@ iler is fallen upon TH@@ Y summer fru@@ its and upon TH@@ Y vin@@ t@@ age .
from the cry of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon even un@@ to Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , and even un@@ to Ja@@ haz , have they ut@@ tered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even un@@ to Hor@@ on@@ aim , as an he@@ if@@ er of three years old : for the waters also of N@@ im@@ rim shall be de@@ so@@ late .
moreover I will cause to ce@@ ase in Mo@@ a@@ b , sa@@ ith the Lord , him that offer@@ eth in the high places , and him that bur@@ net@@ h incen@@ se to his go@@ ds .
for every head shall be bal@@ d , and every be@@ ard cli@@ pped : upon all the hands shall be cut@@ t@@ ings , and upon the lo@@ ins s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th .
there shall be lament@@ ation generally upon all the hous@@ et@@ ops of Mo@@ a@@ b , and in the streets there@@ of : for I have broken Mo@@ a@@ b like a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure , sa@@ ith the Lord .
Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men 's hear@@ ts in Mo@@ a@@ b at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
he that fle@@ eth from the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he that get@@ te@@ th up out of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring upon it , even upon Mo@@ a@@ b , the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the Lord .
they that fled stood under the shadow of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and a fla@@ me from the mid@@ st of S@@ ih@@ on , and shall dev@@ our the cor@@ ner of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the cro@@ wn of the head of the t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ones .
be@@ hold , I will bring a fear upon the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord God of hosts , from all those that be about the@@ e ; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth ; and none shall gather up him that w@@ ander@@ eth .
flee ye , turn back , d@@ well deep , O inhabitants of D@@ ed@@ an ; for I will bring the cal@@ am@@ ity of E@@ sa@@ u upon him , the time that I will visit him .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is sp@@ o@@ iled , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the c@@ up have assu@@ red@@ ly dr@@ un@@ ken ; and art th@@ ou he that shall altogether go un@@ punished ? th@@ ou s@@ halt not go un@@ punished , but th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely drink of it .
I have heard a rum@@ our from the Lord , and an ambassador is sent un@@ to the he@@ a@@ then , saying , G@@ ather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that he hat@@ h taken against E@@ dom ; and his purposes , that he hat@@ h pur@@ posed against the inhabitants of Tem@@ an : su@@ rely the least of the flock shall draw them out : su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tations de@@ so@@ late with them .
the ear@@ th is moved at the no@@ ise of their fall , at the cry the no@@ ise there@@ of was heard in the Red sea .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread his w@@ ings over Boz@@ ra@@ h : and at that day shall the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
concerning K@@ ed@@ ar , and concerning the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of Haz@@ or , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall sm@@ ite , thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; arise ye , go up to K@@ ed@@ ar , and sp@@ oil the men of the east .
their ten@@ ts and their f@@ loc@@ ks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their cur@@ tains , and all their vessels , and their ca@@ me@@ ls ; and they shall cry un@@ to them , Fe@@ ar is on every side .
and their ca@@ me@@ ls shall be a bo@@ o@@ ty , and the multi@@ tude of their c@@ attle a sp@@ oil : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter into all winds them that are in the ut@@ most cor@@ ners ; and I will bring their cal@@ am@@ ity from all sides there@@ of , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the word of the Lord that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t against E@@ lam in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
and upon E@@ lam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heav@@ en , and will sc@@ at@@ ter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation w@@ hi@@ ther the out@@ casts of E@@ lam shall not come .
for out of the north there co@@ me@@ th up a nation against her , which shall make her land de@@ so@@ late , and none shall d@@ well there@@ in : they shall remove , they shall de@@ part , both man and be@@ ast .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the Lord , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h together , going and we@@ eping : they shall go , and seek the Lord their God .
they shall ask the way to Z@@ ion with their faces th@@ i@@ ther@@ ward , saying , C@@ ome , and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpet@@ ual C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that shall not be forgotten .
my people hat@@ h been lost she@@ ep : their she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds have caused them to go as@@ tra@@ y , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their rest@@ ing@@ place .
remove out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and go forth out of the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and be as the he go@@ ats before the f@@ loc@@ ks .
because ye were glad , because ye re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , O ye destro@@ yers of mine heritage , because ye are grown f@@ at as the he@@ if@@ er at gr@@ ass , and Bel@@ low as bul@@ ls ;
your mother shall be sor@@ e con@@ founded ; she that b@@ are you shall be as@@ ha@@ med : be@@ hold , the hin@@ der@@ most of the nations shall be a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert .
because of the wr@@ ath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly de@@ so@@ late : every one that go@@ eth by Bab@@ yl@@ on shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and his@@ s at all her plagu@@ es .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him that hand@@ le@@ th the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
and I will bring Israel again to his habi@@ tation , and he shall fe@@ ed on Car@@ mel and B@@ ash@@ an , and his sou@@ l shall be satisfied upon mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the Lord , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sin@@ s of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall not be found : for I will par@@ don them whom I reserve .
go up against the land of Mer@@ ath@@ aim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pek@@ od : waste and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy after them , sa@@ ith the Lord , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e .
I have laid a sn@@ are for the@@ e , and th@@ ou art also taken , O Bab@@ yl@@ on , and th@@ ou w@@ ast not aware : th@@ ou art found , and also caught , because th@@ ou h@@ ast stri@@ ven against the Lord .
the Lord hat@@ h opened his ar@@ mo@@ ury , and hat@@ h brought forth the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation : for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
S@@ lay all her bul@@ loc@@ ks ; let them go down to the sla@@ ughter : wo@@ e un@@ to them ! for their day is come , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the most proud shall st@@ um@@ ble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kin@@ dle a fire in his cities , and it shall dev@@ our all round about him .
their Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer is strong ; the Lord of hosts is his name : he shall throug@@ h@@ ly p@@ lead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and dis@@ quiet the inhabitants of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
a s@@ word is upon their hor@@ ses , and upon their char@@ i@@ ots , and upon all the min@@ g@@ led people that are in the mid@@ st of her ; and they shall become as women : a s@@ word is upon her treasures ; and they shall be ro@@ bbed .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dri@@ ed up : for it is the land of Gra@@ ven images , and they are ma@@ d upon their id@@ ols .
therefore the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert with the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall d@@ well there , and the ow@@ ls shall d@@ well there@@ in : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be d@@ wel@@ t in from generation to generation .
be@@ hold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many kings shall be raised up from the co@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on hat@@ h heard the report of them , and his hands wa@@ xed fe@@ e@@ ble : an@@ gu@@ ish took hold of him , and pan@@ gs as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
therefore hear ye the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that he hat@@ h taken against Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and his purposes , that he hat@@ h pur@@ posed against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : su@@ rely the least of the flock shall draw them out : su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late with them .
and will send un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on f@@ ann@@ ers , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
against him that ben@@ de@@ th let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him that lif@@ te@@ th himself up in his bri@@ g@@ and@@ ine : and spar@@ e ye not her young men ; destroy ye ut@@ ter@@ ly all her host .
thus the sla@@ in shall fall in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they that are th@@ rust through in her streets .
for Israel hat@@ h not been for@@ sak@@ en , nor Ju@@ da@@ h of his God , of the Lord of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and deliver every man his sou@@ l : be not cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der un@@ to her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
Bab@@ yl@@ on hat@@ h been a golden c@@ up in the Lord 's hand , that made all the ear@@ th dr@@ un@@ ken : the nations have dr@@ un@@ ken of her wine ; therefore the nations are ma@@ d .
we would have he@@ aled Bab@@ yl@@ on , but she is not he@@ aled : for@@ sake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to heav@@ en , and is lifted up even to the sk@@ ies .
make bright the ar@@ ro@@ ws ; gather the shi@@ elds : the Lord hat@@ h raised up the spirit of the kings of the Me@@ des : for his device is against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to destroy it ; because it is the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
he hat@@ h made the ear@@ th by his power , he hat@@ h established the world by his wis@@ dom , and hat@@ h stret@@ ched out the heav@@ en by his understanding .
when he ut@@ ter@@ eth his voice , there is a multi@@ tude of waters in the heav@@ ens ; and he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th : he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings with rain , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth the wind out of his treasures .
every man is bru@@ tish by his knowledge ; every founder is con@@ founded by the Gra@@ ven image : for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the ro@@ d of his inher@@ it@@ ance : the Lord of hosts is his name .
T@@ ho@@ u art my battle ax@@ e and weapons of war : for with the@@ e will I break in pieces the nations , and with the@@ e will I destroy k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ;
and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the char@@ i@@ ot and his Ri@@ der ;
with the@@ e also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces old and young ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the young man and the ma@@ id ;
I will also break in pieces with the@@ e the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and his flock ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hus@@ b@@ and@@ man and his yok@@ e of ox@@ en ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces cap@@ tains and rul@@ ers .
be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , O destroying mountain , sa@@ ith the Lord , which destro@@ y@@ est all the ear@@ th : and I will stretch out mine hand upon the@@ e , and rol@@ l the@@ e down from the ro@@ cks , and will make the@@ e a bur@@ n@@ t mountain .
and they shall not take of the@@ e a stone for a cor@@ ner , nor a stone for foundations ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt be de@@ so@@ late for ever , sa@@ ith the Lord .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Me@@ des , the cap@@ tains there@@ of , and all the rul@@ ers there@@ of , and all the land of his domin@@ ion .
and the land shall tre@@ m@@ ble and sor@@ row : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to make the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation without an inhabi@@ tant .
the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Bab@@ yl@@ on have for@@ born to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hat@@ h failed ; they became as women : they have burned her d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places ; her bars are broken .
in their heat I will make their fe@@ asts , and I will make them dr@@ un@@ ken , that they may re@@ jo@@ ice , and sle@@ ep a perpet@@ ual sle@@ ep , and not wake , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the sea is come up upon Bab@@ yl@@ on : she is covered with the multi@@ tude of the waves there@@ of .
her cities are a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ ry land , and a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a land where@@ in no man d@@ wel@@ le@@ th , neither do@@ th any son of man pass there@@ by .
and I will punish B@@ el in Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring forth out of his m@@ outh that which he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more un@@ to him : ye@@ a , the wall of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall fall .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Gra@@ ven images of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and her whole land shall be con@@ founded , and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will do judgment upon her Gra@@ ven images : and through all her land the wounded shall gro@@ an .
though Bab@@ yl@@ on should mount up to heav@@ en , and though she should for@@ ti@@ fy the he@@ ight of her strength , yet from me shall sp@@ o@@ ilers come un@@ to her , sa@@ ith the Lord .
because the Lord hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled Bab@@ yl@@ on , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do ro@@ ar like great waters , a no@@ ise of their voice is ut@@ tered :
then s@@ halt th@@ ou say , O Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor be@@ ast , but that it shall be de@@ so@@ late for ever .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of reading this book , that th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d a stone to it , and cast it into the mid@@ st of E@@ up@@ h@@ rates :
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im had done .
for through the an@@ ger of the Lord it came to pass in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , ti@@ ll he had cast them out from his presence , that Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and pit@@ ched against it , and built for@@ ts against it round about .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was sor@@ e in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up un@@ to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; where he gave judgment upon him .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes : he sle@@ w also all the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h in R@@ ib@@ lah .
then he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in cha@@ ins , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison ti@@ ll the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , into Jer@@ usalem ,
and burned the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and all the houses of the great men , burned he with fire :
and all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that were with the captain of the guard , br@@ ake down all the walls of Jer@@ usalem round about .
then Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive certain of the poor of the people , and the resi@@ due of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the rest of the multi@@ tude .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vin@@ ed@@ res@@ s@@ ers and for hus@@ b@@ and@@ men .
also the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chal@@ de@@ ans br@@ ake , and carried all the br@@ ass of them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
the cal@@ dr@@ ons also , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and all the vessels of br@@ ass where@@ with they minist@@ ered , took they away .
and the bas@@ ons , and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the cal@@ dr@@ ons , and the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the c@@ ups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
the two pil@@ lars , one sea , and twelve br@@ as@@ en bul@@ ls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord : the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
and concerning the pil@@ lars , the he@@ ight of one pil@@ lar was E@@ igh@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a fil@@ let of twelve cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it ; and the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness there@@ of was four fin@@ gers : it was hol@@ low .
and a chap@@ iter of br@@ ass was upon it ; and the he@@ ight of one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , with network and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates upon the chap@@ it@@ ers round about , all of br@@ ass . the second pil@@ lar also and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were like un@@ to these .
so Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te them , and put them to death in R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . thus Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his own land .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his di@@ et , there was a contin@@ ual di@@ et given him of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ ep@@ eth sor@@ e in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks : among all her lov@@ ers she hat@@ h none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her , they are become her enem@@ ies .
and from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her beauty is depar@@ ted : her pr@@ inces are become like har@@ ts that find no pas@@ ture , and they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
the ad@@ versary hat@@ h spread out his hand upon all her pleas@@ ant things : for she hat@@ h seen that the he@@ a@@ then entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , whom th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st command that they should not enter into TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation .
from above hat@@ h he sent fire into my b@@ ones , and it prev@@ ail@@ eth against them : he hat@@ h spread a net for my feet , he hat@@ h turned me back : he hat@@ h made me de@@ so@@ late and fa@@ int all the day .
the yok@@ e of my trans@@ gres@@ sions is bound by his hand : they are w@@ re@@ ath@@ ed , and come up upon my nec@@ k : he hat@@ h made my strength to fall , the Lord hat@@ h delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
the Lord hat@@ h tro@@ dden under fo@@ ot all my m@@ igh@@ ty men in the mid@@ st of me : he hat@@ h called an assembly against me to cr@@ ush my young men : the Lord hat@@ h tro@@ dden the vir@@ gin , the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h , as in a win@@ e@@ press .
Z@@ ion sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th forth her hands , and there is none to comfor@@ t her : the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded concerning Jac@@ o@@ b , that his ad@@ vers@@ aries should be round about him : Jer@@ usalem is as a men@@ stru@@ ous woman among them .
the Lord is righ@@ te@@ ous ; for I have rebel@@ led against his comman@@ d@@ ment : hear , I pra@@ y you , all people , and be@@ hold my sor@@ row : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are gone into cap@@ tivity .
I called for my lov@@ ers , but they dec@@ e@@ ived me : my pri@@ ests and mine el@@ ders gave up the gh@@ ost in the city , while they sought their meat to reli@@ eve their so@@ ul@@ s .
let all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess come before the@@ e ; and do un@@ to them , as th@@ ou h@@ ast done un@@ to me for all my trans@@ gres@@ sions : for my si@@ gh@@ s are many , and my heart is fa@@ int .
how hat@@ h the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger , and cast down from heav@@ en un@@ to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , and remember@@ ed not his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger !
the Lord hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all the habi@@ tations of Jac@@ o@@ b , and hat@@ h not p@@ iti@@ ed : he hat@@ h thrown down in his wr@@ ath the strong holds of the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h ; he hat@@ h brought them down to the ground : he hat@@ h pollu@@ ted the k@@ ing@@ dom and the pr@@ inces there@@ of .
he hat@@ h b@@ ent his bo@@ w like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an ad@@ versary , and sle@@ w all that were pleas@@ ant to the eye in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the daughter of Z@@ ion : he p@@ oured out his fur@@ y like fire .
the Lord was as an enemy : he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up Israel , he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces : he hat@@ h destroyed his strong holds , and hat@@ h increased in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
the Lord hat@@ h cast off his alt@@ ar , he hat@@ h ab@@ hor@@ red his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he hat@@ h given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her pal@@ aces ; they have made a no@@ ise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a so@@ lem@@ n feast .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit upon the ground , and keep sil@@ ence : they have cast up d@@ ust upon their heads ; they have gir@@ ded themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
mine eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my bo@@ wel@@ s are troubled , my li@@ ver is p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the su@@ ck@@ lings s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
they say to their mothers , W@@ here is cor@@ n and wine ? when they s@@ wo@@ oned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their sou@@ l was p@@ oured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
TH@@ Y pro@@ ph@@ ets have seen v@@ ain and fo@@ ol@@ ish things for the@@ e : and they have not discovered th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , to turn away TH@@ Y cap@@ tivity ; but have seen for the@@ e false bur@@ den@@ s and causes of ban@@ is@@ hment .
all th@@ ine enem@@ ies have opened their m@@ outh against the@@ e : they his@@ s and gn@@ ash the te@@ eth : they say , We have sw@@ allowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
the Lord hat@@ h done that which he had dev@@ ised ; he hat@@ h fulfilled his word that he had comman@@ ded in the days of old : he hat@@ h thrown down , and hat@@ h not p@@ iti@@ ed : and he hat@@ h caused th@@ ine enemy to re@@ jo@@ ice over the@@ e , he hat@@ h set up the Hor@@ n of th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries .
their heart cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let te@@ ars run down like a river day and night : give th@@ y@@ self no rest ; let not the app@@ le of th@@ ine eye ce@@ ase .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the wat@@ ches p@@ our out th@@ ine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up TH@@ Y hands toward him for the life of TH@@ Y young children , that fa@@ int for hunger in the top of every street .
be@@ hold , O Lord , and consider to whom th@@ ou h@@ ast done this . shall the women eat their fruit , and children of a sp@@ an long ? shall the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t be sla@@ in in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord ?
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word ; th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in them in the day of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; th@@ ou h@@ ast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
he hat@@ h turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hat@@ h made me de@@ so@@ late .
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most fine gold changed ! the stones of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary are p@@ oured out in the top of every street .
even the sea mon@@ sters draw out the bre@@ ast , they give su@@ ck to their young ones : the daughter of my people is become cru@@ el , like the os@@ tri@@ ches in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the ton@@ gue of the suc@@ king child cle@@ av@@ eth to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man break@@ eth it un@@ to them .
for the punishment of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of So@@ dom , that was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
her N@@ azar@@ ites were pu@@ rer than snow , they were w@@ hi@@ ter than milk , they were more ru@@ d@@ dy in body than ru@@ bies , their polis@@ hing was of sap@@ ph@@ ire :
their vis@@ age is bla@@ cker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their s@@ kin cle@@ av@@ eth to their b@@ ones ; it is with@@ ered , it is become like a stick .
they that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word are better than they that be sla@@ in with hunger : for these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have so@@ dden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the Lord hat@@ h accomplished his fur@@ y ; he hat@@ h p@@ oured out his fierce an@@ ger , and hat@@ h kin@@ d@@ led a fire in Z@@ ion , and it hat@@ h dev@@ oured the foundations there@@ of .
the kings of the ear@@ th , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the ad@@ versary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
for the sin@@ s of her pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of her pri@@ ests , that have shed the blood of the just in the mid@@ st of her ,
they have w@@ and@@ ered as b@@ lin@@ d men in the streets , they have pollu@@ ted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their gar@@ ments .
the an@@ ger of the Lord hat@@ h divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the pri@@ ests , they favoured not the el@@ ders .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our v@@ ain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
they hunt our steps , that we can@@ not go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
our persec@@ ut@@ ors are swi@@ f@@ ter than the e@@ ag@@ les of the heav@@ en : they pursu@@ ed us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , O daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ wel@@ lest in the land of U@@ z ; the c@@ up also shall pass through un@@ to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt be dr@@ un@@ ken , and s@@ halt make th@@ y@@ self nak@@ ed .
we have given the hand to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , to be satisfied with bread .
now it came to pass in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I looked , and , be@@ hold , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind came out of the north , a great cl@@ oud , and a fire in@@ fol@@ ding itself , and a bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was about it , and out of the mid@@ st there@@ of as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber , out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
also out of the mid@@ st there@@ of came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . and this was their appearance ; they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
and their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot : and they spar@@ k@@ led like the col@@ our of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
their w@@ ings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
as for the lik@@ eness of the living cre@@ atures , their appearance was like burning co@@ als of fire , and like the appearance of lam@@ ps : it went up and down among the living cre@@ atures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth ligh@@ t@@ ning .
the appearance of the whe@@ els and their work was like un@@ to the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l : and they four had one lik@@ eness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a whe@@ el in the middle of a whe@@ el .
as for their r@@ ings , they were so high that they were d@@ read@@ ful ; and their r@@ ings were full of eyes round about them four .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went , th@@ ither was their spirit to go ; and the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
and the lik@@ eness of the fir@@ mam@@ ent upon the heads of the living cre@@ ature was as the col@@ our of the ter@@ ri@@ ble cr@@ y@@ st@@ al , stret@@ ched forth over their heads above .
and under the fir@@ mam@@ ent were their w@@ ings stra@@ ight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and when they went , I heard the no@@ ise of their w@@ ings , like the no@@ ise of great waters , as the voice of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , the voice of speech , as the no@@ ise of an host : when they stood , they let down their w@@ ings .
and there was a voice from the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was over their heads , when they stood , and had let down their w@@ ings .
and above the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone : and upon the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was the lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I saw as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , and from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness round about .
and the spirit entered into me when he sp@@ ake un@@ to me , and set me upon my feet , that I heard him that sp@@ ake un@@ to me .
and he said un@@ to me , Son of man , I send the@@ e to the children of Israel , to a rebel@@ li@@ ous nation that hat@@ h rebel@@ led against me : they and their fa@@ thers have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me , even un@@ to this very day .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , ) yet shall know that there hat@@ h been a pro@@ phe@@ t among them .
and he said un@@ to me , Son of man , cause TH@@ Y bel@@ ly to eat , and fill TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s with this rol@@ l that I give the@@ e . then did I eat it ; and it was in my m@@ outh as hon@@ ey for swe@@ et@@ ness .
not to many people of a st@@ range speech and of an hard language , whose words th@@ ou can@@ st not understand . su@@ rely , had I sent the@@ e to them , they would have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e .
moreover he said un@@ to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak un@@ to the@@ e receive in th@@ ine heart , and hear with th@@ ine e@@ ars .
and go , get the@@ e to them of the cap@@ tivity , un@@ to the children of TH@@ Y people , and speak un@@ to them , and tell them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear .
I heard also the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures that touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els over against them , and a no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the cap@@ tivity at Tel @@@ -@@ @ abi@@ b , that d@@ wel@@ t by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there ast@@ on@@ ished among them seven days .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , I have made the@@ e a watch@@ man un@@ to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my m@@ outh , and give them warning from me .
yet if th@@ ou warn the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he turn not from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and sp@@ ake with me , and said un@@ to me , G@@ o , shut th@@ y@@ self within th@@ ine house .
but th@@ ou , O son of man , be@@ hold , they shall put bands upon the@@ e , and shall bin@@ d the@@ e with them , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go out among them :
and I will make TH@@ Y ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , that th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and s@@ halt not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
but when I speak with the@@ e , I will open TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; He that he@@ aret@@ h , let him hear ; and he that for@@ be@@ aret@@ h , let him for@@ bear : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build a For@@ t against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it round about .
lie th@@ ou also upon TH@@ Y left side , and lay the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that th@@ ou s@@ halt lie upon it th@@ ou s@@ halt bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for I have laid upon the@@ e the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days : so s@@ halt th@@ ou bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt set TH@@ Y face toward the siege of Jer@@ usalem , and th@@ ine arm shall be uncovered , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against it .
and , be@@ hold , I will lay bands upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not turn the@@ e from one side to another , ti@@ ll th@@ ou h@@ ast ended the days of TH@@ Y siege .
and TH@@ Y meat which th@@ ou s@@ halt eat shall be by weight , twenty sh@@ ek@@ els a day : from time to time s@@ halt th@@ ou eat it .
and th@@ ou , son of man , take the@@ e a sharp k@@ ni@@ fe , take the@@ e a Bar@@ ber 's ras@@ or , and cause it to pass upon th@@ ine head and upon TH@@ Y be@@ ard : then take the@@ e balan@@ ces to weight , and divide the ha@@ ir .
then take of them again , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the fire , and bur@@ n them in the fire ; for there@@ of shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; This is Jer@@ usalem : I have set it in the mid@@ st of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hat@@ h changed my judg@@ ments into w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judg@@ ments and my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause ye multi@@ p@@ lied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have kept my judg@@ ments , neither have done according to the judg@@ ments of the nations that are round about you ;
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I , even I , am against the@@ e , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the mid@@ st of the@@ e in the sight of the nations .
and I will do in the@@ e that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the@@ e , and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of the@@ e will I sc@@ at@@ ter into all the winds .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God ; su@@ rely , because th@@ ou h@@ ast def@@ iled my sanc@@ tu@@ ary with all TH@@ Y de@@ te@@ stable things , and with all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations , therefore will I also dimin@@ ish the@@ e ; neither shall mine eye spar@@ e , neither will I have any p@@ ity .
when I shall send upon them the ev@@ il ar@@ ro@@ ws of fam@@ ine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the fam@@ ine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
and say , Y@@ e mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hil@@ ls , to the rivers , and to the val@@ ley@@ s ; be@@ hold , I , even I , will bring a s@@ word upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
and I will lay the dead car@@ cases of the children of Israel before their id@@ ols ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter your b@@ ones round about your al@@ tar@@ s .
yet will I leave a re@@ mn@@ ant , that ye may have some that shall escape the s@@ word among the nations , when ye shall be sc@@ at@@ tered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , and that I have not said in v@@ ain that I would do this ev@@ il un@@ to them .
he that is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he that is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he that remain@@ eth and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my fur@@ y upon them .
so will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land de@@ so@@ late , ye@@ a , more de@@ so@@ late than the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness toward Di@@ bla@@ th , in all their habi@@ tations : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
also , th@@ ou son of man , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to the land of Israel ; A@@ n end , the end is come upon the four cor@@ ners of the land .
now is the end come upon the@@ e , and I will send mine an@@ ger upon the@@ e , and will judge the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways , and will re@@ compen@@ se upon the@@ e all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
and mine eye shall not spar@@ e the@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : but I will re@@ compen@@ se TH@@ Y ways upon the@@ e , and th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
now will I shortly p@@ our out my fur@@ y upon the@@ e , and accomp@@ lish mine an@@ ger upon the@@ e : and I will judge the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways , and will re@@ compen@@ se the@@ e for all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
and mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : I will re@@ compen@@ se the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways and th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations that are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that sm@@ ite@@ th .
violence is risen up into a ro@@ d of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : none of them shall remain , nor of their multi@@ tude , nor of any of the@@ ir@@ s : neither shall there be w@@ ailing for them .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is tou@@ ching the whole multi@@ tude there@@ of , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
they have blo@@ wn the tr@@ ump@@ et , even to make all ready ; but none go@@ eth to the battle : for my wr@@ ath is upon all the multi@@ tude there@@ of .
the s@@ word is without , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and the fam@@ ine within : he that is in the field shall die with the s@@ word ; and he that is in the city , fam@@ ine and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce shall dev@@ our him .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ ov@@ es of the val@@ ley@@ s , all of them mourning , every one for his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
they shall also gir@@ d themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and hor@@ ror shall cover them ; and sh@@ ame shall be upon all faces , and bal@@ d@@ ness upon all their heads .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty : but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and of their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the st@@ ran@@ gers for a pre@@ y , and to the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th for a sp@@ oil ; and they shall poll@@ ute it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall poll@@ ute my secret place : for the rob@@ bers shall enter into it , and def@@ ile it .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I will bring the worst of the he@@ a@@ then , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pom@@ p of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be def@@ iled .
Mis@@ chief shall come upon mis@@ chief , and rum@@ our shall be upon rum@@ our ; then shall they seek a vision of the pro@@ phe@@ t ; but the law shall per@@ ish from the pri@@ est , and coun@@ sel from the an@@ ci@@ ents .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h sat before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me .
then I be@@ held , and lo a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , fire ; and from his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber .
and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the pla@@ in .
then said he un@@ to me , Son of man , lift up th@@ ine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and be@@ hold nor@@ th@@ ward at the gate of the alt@@ ar this image of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in the entry .
so I went in and saw ; and be@@ hold every form of cre@@ eping things , and ab@@ omin@@ able be@@ asts , and all the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , po@@ ur@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed upon the wall round about .
and there stood before them sev@@ enty men of the an@@ ci@@ ents of the house of Israel , and in the mid@@ st of them stood Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , with every man his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and a th@@ ick cl@@ oud of incen@@ se went up .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord 's house which was toward the north ; and , be@@ hold , there sat women we@@ eping for Tam@@ muz .
and he brought me into the in@@ ner court of the Lord 's house , and , be@@ hold , at the door of the temp@@ le of the Lord , between the por@@ ch and the alt@@ ar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temp@@ le of the Lord , and their faces toward the east ; and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in fur@@ y : mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : and though they cry in mine e@@ ars with a l@@ oud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cri@@ ed also in mine e@@ ars with a l@@ oud voice , saying , C@@ ause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was gone up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en , which had the writer 's in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side ;
and the Lord said un@@ to him , G@@ o through the mid@@ st of the city , through the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem , and set a mark upon the fore@@ heads of the men that si@@ gh and that cry for all the ab@@ omin@@ ations that be done in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , G@@ o ye after him through the city , and sm@@ ite : let not your eye spar@@ e , neither have ye p@@ ity :
then said he un@@ to me , The in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess : for they say , The Lord hat@@ h for@@ sak@@ en the ear@@ th , and the Lord se@@ eth not .
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity , but I will re@@ compen@@ se their way upon their head .
and , be@@ hold , the man clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en , which had the in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as th@@ ou h@@ ast comman@@ ded me .
then I looked , and , be@@ hold , in the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was above the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms there appeared over them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
then the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the Lord 's gl@@ ory .
and it came to pass , that when he had comman@@ ded the man clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en , saying , T@@ ake fire from between the whe@@ els , from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms ; then he went in , and stood bes@@ ide the whe@@ els .
and one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b stret@@ ched forth his hand from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms un@@ to the fire that was between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and took there@@ of , and put it into the hands of him that was clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en : who took it , and went out .
and when I looked , be@@ hold the four whe@@ els by the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , one whe@@ el by one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el by another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : and the appearance of the whe@@ els was as the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
and as for their appe@@ aran@@ ces , they four had one lik@@ eness , as if a whe@@ el had been in the mid@@ st of a whe@@ el .
when they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place w@@ hi@@ ther the head looked they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes round about , even the whe@@ els that they four had .
and when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms went , the whe@@ els went by them : and when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lifted up their w@@ ings to mount up from the ear@@ th , the same whe@@ els also turned not from bes@@ ide them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in them .
then the gl@@ ory of the Lord depar@@ ted from off the threshold of the house , and stood over the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lifted up their w@@ ings , and moun@@ ted up from the ear@@ th in my sight : when they went out , the whe@@ els also were bes@@ ide them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord 's house ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
this is the living cre@@ ature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of C@@ he@@ bar ; and I knew that they were the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
and the lik@@ eness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves : they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord fell upon me , and said un@@ to me , Spe@@ ak ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; Th@@ us have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ our sla@@ in whom ye have laid in the mid@@ st of it , they are the f@@ les@@ h , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the mid@@ st of it .
and I will bring you out of the mid@@ st there@@ of , and deliver you into the hands of st@@ ran@@ gers , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments among you .
Y@@ e shall fall by the s@@ word ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord : for ye have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither executed my judg@@ ments , but have done after the man@@ ners of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you .
therefore say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will even gather you from the people , and assem@@ ble you out of the countries where ye have been sc@@ at@@ tered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
and they shall come th@@ ither , and they shall take away all the de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ of and all the ab@@ omin@@ ations there@@ of from th@@ ence .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their f@@ les@@ h , and will give them an heart of f@@ les@@ h :
that they may walk in my stat@@ utes , and keep mine ord@@ inan@@ ces , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walk@@ eth after the heart of their de@@ te@@ stable things and their ab@@ omin@@ ations , I will re@@ compen@@ se their way upon their own heads , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
then did the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lift up their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the mid@@ st of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spiri@@ t of God into Chal@@ de@@ a , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , th@@ ou d@@ wel@@ lest in the mid@@ st of a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have e@@ ars to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou bring forth TH@@ Y stu@@ ff by day in their sight , as stu@@ ff for removing : and th@@ ou s@@ halt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into cap@@ tivity .
in their sight s@@ halt th@@ ou bear it upon TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ ders , and carry it forth in the tw@@ il@@ ight : th@@ ou s@@ halt cover TH@@ Y face , that th@@ ou see not the ground : for I have set the@@ e for a sign un@@ to the house of Israel .
and I did so as I was comman@@ ded : I brought forth my stu@@ ff by day , as stu@@ ff for cap@@ tivity , and in the even I dig@@ ged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and I b@@ are it upon my sho@@ ul@@ der in their sight .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are : and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the s@@ word after them .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall sc@@ at@@ ter them among the nations , and disper@@ se them in the countries .
son of man , be@@ hold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he se@@ eth is for many days to come , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth of the times that are far off .
Y@@ e have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither made up the h@@ edge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
they have seen van@@ ity and lying div@@ ination , saying , The Lord sa@@ ith : and the Lord hat@@ h not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a v@@ ain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying div@@ ination , whereas ye say , The Lord sa@@ ith it ; al@@ be@@ it I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have s@@ educ@@ ed my people , saying , Peace ; and there was no peace ; and one built up a wall , and , lo , others da@@ ub@@ ed it with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter :
say un@@ to them which da@@ u@@ b it with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
L@@ o , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said un@@ to you , W@@ here is the da@@ ub@@ ing where@@ with ye have da@@ ub@@ ed it ?
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will even ren@@ d it with a stor@@ my wind in my fur@@ y ; and there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer in mine an@@ ger , and great ha@@ il@@ stones in my fur@@ y to consum@@ e it .
so will I break down the wall that ye have da@@ ub@@ ed with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation there@@ of shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consu@@ med in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
likewise , th@@ ou son of man , set TH@@ Y face against the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of TH@@ Y people , which pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y out of their own heart ; and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y th@@ ou against them ,
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , by promising him life :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and if the pro@@ phe@@ t be dec@@ e@@ ived when he hat@@ h spoken a thing , I the Lord have dec@@ e@@ ived that pro@@ phe@@ t , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the mid@@ st of my people Israel .
and they shall bear the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : the punishment of the pro@@ phe@@ t shall be even as the punishment of him that seek@@ eth un@@ to him ;
that the house of Israel may go no more as@@ tra@@ y from me , neither be pollu@@ ted any more with all their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
though No@@ ah , Daniel , and Jo@@ b , were in it , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own so@@ ul@@ s by their righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and they shall comfor@@ t you , when ye see their ways and their do@@ ings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
be@@ hold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th both the ends of it , and the mid@@ st of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
be@@ hold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured it , and it is burned ?
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall dev@@ our them ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them .
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to Jer@@ usalem ; Th@@ y birth and TH@@ Y nati@@ vity is of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; TH@@ Y father was an Am@@ or@@ ite , and TH@@ Y mother an H@@ itti@@ te .
and as for TH@@ Y nati@@ vity , in the day th@@ ou w@@ ast born TH@@ Y nav@@ el was not cut , neither w@@ ast th@@ ou was@@ hed in water to supp@@ le the@@ e ; th@@ ou w@@ ast not sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed the@@ e , to do any of these un@@ to the@@ e , to have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e ; but th@@ ou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of TH@@ Y person , in the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast born .
and when I passed by the@@ e , and saw the@@ e pollu@@ ted in th@@ ine own blood , I said un@@ to the@@ e when th@@ ou w@@ ast in TH@@ Y blood , Li@@ ve ; ye@@ a , I said un@@ to the@@ e when th@@ ou w@@ ast in TH@@ Y blood , Li@@ ve .
then was@@ hed I the@@ e with water ; ye@@ a , I throug@@ h@@ ly was@@ hed away TH@@ Y blood from the@@ e , and I ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e with oil .
I clo@@ th@@ ed the@@ e also with bro@@ i@@ dered work , and sho@@ d the@@ e with bad@@ gers ' s@@ kin , and I gir@@ ded the@@ e about with fine lin@@ en , and I covered the@@ e with sil@@ k .
and I put a je@@ w@@ el on TH@@ Y fore@@ head , and ear@@ r@@ ings in th@@ ine e@@ ars , and a beautiful cro@@ wn upon th@@ ine head .
thus w@@ ast th@@ ou dec@@ ked with gold and silver ; and TH@@ Y ra@@ im@@ ent was of fine lin@@ en , and sil@@ k , and bro@@ i@@ dered work ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st eat fine fl@@ our , and hon@@ ey , and oil : and th@@ ou w@@ ast exceeding beautiful , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st prosp@@ er into a k@@ ing@@ dom .
and TH@@ Y ren@@ own went forth among the he@@ a@@ then for TH@@ Y beauty : for it was perfect through my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess , which I had put upon the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
but th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st trust in th@@ ine own beauty , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot because of TH@@ Y ren@@ own , and p@@ ou@@ red@@ st out TH@@ Y for@@ nic@@ ations on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of TH@@ Y gar@@ ments th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st take , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st TH@@ Y high places with di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot there@@ upon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also taken TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given the@@ e , and ma@@ dest to th@@ y@@ self images of men , and di@@ d@@ st commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with them ,
my meat also which I gave the@@ e , fine fl@@ our , and oil , and hon@@ ey , where@@ with I f@@ ed the@@ e , th@@ ou h@@ ast even set it before them for a swe@@ et sav@@ our : and thus it was , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
moreover th@@ ou h@@ ast taken TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast bor@@ ne un@@ to me , and these h@@ ast th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to them to be dev@@ oured . is this of TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms a small matter ,
that th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and in all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations and TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms th@@ ou h@@ ast not remember@@ ed the days of TH@@ Y youth , when th@@ ou w@@ ast nak@@ ed and b@@ are , and w@@ ast pollu@@ ted in TH@@ Y blood .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast built TH@@ Y high place at every head of the way , and h@@ ast made TH@@ Y beauty to be ab@@ hor@@ red , and h@@ ast opened TH@@ Y feet to every one that passed by , and multi@@ p@@ lied TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also committed for@@ nic@@ ation with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans TH@@ Y neighbours , great of f@@ les@@ h ; and h@@ ast increased TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast played the wh@@ ore also with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , because th@@ ou w@@ ast un@@ s@@ ati@@ able ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou h@@ ast played the har@@ lot with them , and yet co@@ ul@@ dest not be satisfied .
in that th@@ ou buil@@ dest th@@ ine emin@@ ent place in the head of every way , and mak@@ est th@@ ine high place in every street ; and h@@ ast not been as an har@@ lot , in that th@@ ou scor@@ n@@ est h@@ ire ;
they give gifts to all who@@ res : but th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est TH@@ Y gifts to all TH@@ Y lov@@ ers , and hi@@ rest them , that they may come un@@ to the@@ e on every side for TH@@ Y wh@@ ore@@ dom .
and the contrary is in the@@ e from other women in TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms , whereas none follow@@ eth the@@ e to commit who@@ red@@ oms : and in that th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est a reward , and no reward is given un@@ to the@@ e , therefore th@@ ou art contrary .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness was p@@ oured out , and TH@@ Y nak@@ edn@@ ess discovered through TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms with TH@@ Y lov@@ ers , and with all the id@@ ols of TH@@ Y ab@@ omin@@ ations , and by the blood of TH@@ Y children , which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st give un@@ to them ;
and I will also give the@@ e into their hand , and they shall throw down th@@ ine emin@@ ent place , and shall break down TH@@ Y high places : they shall stri@@ p the@@ e also of TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es , and shall take TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s , and leave the@@ e nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
they shall also bring up a company against the@@ e , and they shall stone the@@ e with stones , and th@@ rust the@@ e through with their s@@ words .
and they shall bur@@ n th@@ ine houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments upon the@@ e in the sight of many women : and I will cause the@@ e to ce@@ ase from playing the har@@ lot , and th@@ ou also s@@ halt give no h@@ ire any more .
so will I make my fur@@ y toward the@@ e to rest , and my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y shall de@@ part from the@@ e , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
T@@ ho@@ u art TH@@ Y mother 's daughter , that lo@@ th@@ eth her husband and her children ; and th@@ ou art the sister of TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , which lo@@ th@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was an H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
and th@@ ine el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that d@@ well at TH@@ Y left hand : and TH@@ Y younger sister , that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th at TH@@ Y right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
yet h@@ ast th@@ ou not walked after their ways , nor done after their ab@@ omin@@ ations : but , as if that were a very little thing , th@@ ou w@@ ast cor@@ rupted more than they in all TH@@ Y ways .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , So@@ dom TH@@ Y sister hat@@ h not done , she nor her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , as th@@ ou h@@ ast done , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
be@@ hold , this was the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of TH@@ Y sister So@@ dom , pride , ful@@ ness of bread , and ab@@ und@@ ance of id@@ len@@ ess was in her and in her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
neither hat@@ h Samar@@ ia committed half of TH@@ Y sin@@ s ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast multi@@ p@@ lied th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations more than they , and h@@ ast justified TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers in all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations which th@@ ou h@@ ast done .
when I shall bring again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , then will I bring again the cap@@ tivity of TH@@ Y cap@@ tives in the mid@@ st of them :
that th@@ ou may@@ est bear th@@ ine own sh@@ ame , and may@@ est be con@@ founded in all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , in that th@@ ou art a comfor@@ t un@@ to them .
when TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate , and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate , then th@@ ou and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt remember TH@@ Y ways , and be as@@ ha@@ med , when th@@ ou s@@ halt receive TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , th@@ ine el@@ der and TH@@ Y younger : and I will give them un@@ to the@@ e for da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , but not by TH@@ Y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
that th@@ ou may@@ est remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open TH@@ Y m@@ outh any more because of TH@@ Y sh@@ ame , when I am p@@ ac@@ ified toward the@@ e for all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
he cro@@ pped off the top of his young tw@@ ig@@ s , and carried it into a land of traffic@@ k ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
he took also of the se@@ ed of the land , and plan@@ ted it in a fruit@@ ful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a w@@ il@@ low tree .
it was plan@@ ted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a good@@ ly v@@ ine .
and hat@@ h taken of the king 's se@@ ed , and made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him , and hat@@ h taken an oath of him : he hat@@ h also taken the m@@ igh@@ ty of the land :
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely in the place where the king d@@ wel@@ le@@ th that made him king , whose oath he desp@@ ised , and whose C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant he br@@ ake , even with him in the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on he shall die .
seeing he desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hat@@ h done all these things , he shall not escape .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; As I live , su@@ rely mine oath that he hat@@ h desp@@ ised , and my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that he hat@@ h broken , even it will I re@@ compen@@ se upon his own head .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will p@@ lead with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed against me .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the s@@ word , and they that remain shall be sc@@ at@@ tered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it .
what mean ye , that ye use this pro@@ ver@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten s@@ our grap@@ es , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge ?
be@@ hold , all so@@ ul@@ s are mine ; as the sou@@ l of the father , so also the sou@@ l of the son is mine : the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h , it shall die .
and hat@@ h not e@@ aten upon the mountains , neither hat@@ h lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither hat@@ h def@@ iled his neighbour 's wife , neither hat@@ h come near to a men@@ stru@@ ous woman ,
and hat@@ h not op@@ pressed any , but hat@@ h restored to the deb@@ tor his pledge , hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled none by violence , hat@@ h given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and hat@@ h covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
he that hat@@ h not given forth upon us@@ ury , neither hat@@ h taken any increase , that hat@@ h withdrawn his hand from in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , hat@@ h executed true judgment between man and man ,
H@@ ath op@@ pressed the poor and ne@@ edy , hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled by violence , hat@@ h not restored the pledge , and hat@@ h lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols , hat@@ h committed ab@@ omin@@ ation ,
that hat@@ h not e@@ aten upon the mountains , neither hat@@ h lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , hat@@ h not def@@ iled his neighbour 's wife ,
neither hat@@ h op@@ pressed any , hat@@ h not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled by violence , but hat@@ h given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and hat@@ h covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ,
that hat@@ h taken off his hand from the poor , that hat@@ h not received us@@ ury nor increase , hat@@ h executed my judg@@ ments , hat@@ h walked in my stat@@ utes ; he shall not die for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall su@@ rely live .
as for his father , because he cru@@ el@@ ly op@@ pressed , sp@@ o@@ iled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked will turn from all his sin@@ s that he hat@@ h committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he hat@@ h committed , they shall not be mentioned un@@ to him : in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness that he hat@@ h done he shall live .
when a righ@@ te@@ ous man tur@@ net@@ h away from his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and commit@@ te@@ th in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and di@@ eth in them ; for his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity that he hat@@ h done shall he die .
again , when the w@@ ic@@ ked man tur@@ net@@ h away from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess that he hat@@ h committed , and do@@ eth that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall save his sou@@ l alive .
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , where@@ by ye have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their p@@ it , and they brought him with cha@@ ins un@@ to the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had w@@ aited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whel@@ ps , and made him a young lion .
and he knew their de@@ so@@ late pal@@ aces , and he laid waste their cities ; and the land was de@@ so@@ late , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of , by the no@@ ise of his ro@@ aring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him : he was taken in their p@@ it .
and they put him in ward in cha@@ ins , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
and she had strong ro@@ ds for the scep@@ t@@ res of them that b@@ are rule , and her stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted among the th@@ ick branches , and she appeared in her he@@ ight with the multi@@ tude of her branches .
but she was p@@ lu@@ cked up in fur@@ y , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dri@@ ed up her fruit : her strong ro@@ ds were broken and with@@ ered ; the fire consu@@ med them .
and fire is gone out of a ro@@ d of her branches , which hat@@ h dev@@ oured her fruit , so that she hat@@ h no strong ro@@ d to be a scep@@ tre to rule . this is a lament@@ ation , and shall be for a lament@@ ation .
and it came to pass in the seventh year , in the fifth month , the tenth day of the month , that certain of the el@@ ders of Israel came to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , and sat before me .
son of man , speak un@@ to the el@@ ders of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Ar@@ e ye come to inqu@@ ire of me ? as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , I will not be inqu@@ ired of by you .
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand un@@ to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known un@@ to them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had es@@ p@@ ied for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands :
then said I un@@ to them , cast ye away every man the ab@@ omin@@ ations of his eyes , and def@@ ile not yo@@ ur@@ selves with the id@@ ols of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
but I w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted before the he@@ a@@ then , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known un@@ to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and I gave them my stat@@ utes , and she@@ wed them my judg@@ ments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
moreover also I gave them my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord that sanc@@ ti@@ fy them .
but I w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted before the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them out .
yet also I lifted up my hand un@@ to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
but I said un@@ to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , Wal@@ k ye not in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their judg@@ ments , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols :
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them also in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would sc@@ at@@ ter them among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my judg@@ ments , but had desp@@ ised my stat@@ utes , and had pollu@@ ted my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and their eyes were after their fa@@ thers ' id@@ ols .
therefore , son of man , speak un@@ to the house of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ et in this your fa@@ thers have b@@ las@@ phe@@ med me , in that they have committed a t@@ res@@ pass against me .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with fur@@ y p@@ oured out , will I rule over you :
and I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries where@@ in ye are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with fur@@ y p@@ oured out .
and I will bring you into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the people , and there will I p@@ lead with you face to face .
like as I pleaded with your fa@@ thers in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the land of Egypt , so will I p@@ lead with you , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and I will cause you to pass under the ro@@ d , and I will bring you into the bond of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and I will pur@@ ge out from among you the rebels , and them that trans@@ gress against me : I will bring them forth out of the country where they so@@ jour@@ n , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; G@@ o ye , serve ye every one his id@@ ols , and her@@ e@@ after also , if ye will not he@@ arken un@@ to me : but poll@@ ute ye my hol@@ y name no more with your gifts , and with your id@@ ols .
for in mine hol@@ y mountain , in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of your ob@@ lations , with all your hol@@ y things .
I will accept you with your swe@@ et sav@@ our , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries where@@ in ye have been sc@@ at@@ tered ; and I will be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in you before the he@@ a@@ then .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fa@@ thers .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , where@@ in ye have been def@@ iled ; and ye shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that ye have committed .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have w@@ rought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your w@@ ic@@ ked ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , O ye house of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
son of man , set TH@@ Y face toward the south , and drop TH@@ Y word toward the south , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the forest of the south field ;
and say to the land of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , and will draw forth my s@@ word out of his she@@ ath , and will cut off from the@@ e the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked .
seeing then that I will cut off from the@@ e the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked , therefore shall my s@@ word go forth out of his she@@ ath against all f@@ les@@ h from the south to the north :
it is shar@@ pen@@ ed to make a sor@@ e sla@@ ughter ; it is fur@@ b@@ ished that it may g@@ lit@@ ter : should we then make mir@@ th ? it con@@ tem@@ net@@ h the ro@@ d of my son , as every tree .
and he hat@@ h give it to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : this s@@ word is shar@@ pen@@ ed , and it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the S@@ lay@@ er .
cry and ho@@ w@@ l , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the pr@@ inces of Israel : terr@@ ors by reason of the s@@ word shall be upon my people : sm@@ ite therefore upon TH@@ Y th@@ igh .
also , th@@ ou son of man , appoint the@@ e two ways , that the s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on may come : both tw@@ ain shall come forth out of one land : and choose th@@ ou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
and it shall be un@@ to them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , to them that have sworn o@@ aths : but he will call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that they may be taken .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Rem@@ o@@ ve the di@@ ade@@ m , and take off the cro@@ wn : this shall not be the same : ex@@ alt him that is low , and ab@@ ase him that is high .
I will over@@ turn , over@@ turn , over@@ turn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him .
shall I cause it to return into his she@@ ath ? I will judge the@@ e in the place where th@@ ou w@@ ast created , in the land of TH@@ Y nati@@ vity .
and I will p@@ our out mine in@@ dign@@ ation upon the@@ e , I will blow against the@@ e in the fire of my wr@@ ath , and deliver the@@ e into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and s@@ kil@@ ful to destroy .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be for fuel to the fire ; TH@@ Y blood shall be in the mid@@ st of the land ; th@@ ou s@@ halt be no more remember@@ ed : for I the Lord have spoken it .
then say th@@ ou , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God , The city sh@@ ed@@ de@@ th blood in the mid@@ st of it , that her time may come , and mak@@ eth id@@ ols against her@@ self to def@@ ile her@@ self .
in the@@ e have they set light by father and mother : in the mid@@ st of the@@ e have they dealt by op@@ pression with the st@@ ran@@ ger : in the@@ e have they v@@ ex@@ ed the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
and one hat@@ h committed ab@@ omin@@ ation with his neighbour 's wife ; and another hat@@ h le@@ w@@ dly def@@ iled his daughter in law ; and another in the@@ e hat@@ h hum@@ b@@ led his sister , his father 's daughter .
be@@ hold , therefore I have s@@ mit@@ ten mine hand at TH@@ Y dis@@ honest gain which th@@ ou h@@ ast made , and at TH@@ Y blood which hat@@ h been in the mid@@ st of the@@ e .
can th@@ ine heart en@@ dur@@ e , or can th@@ ine hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with the@@ e ? I the Lord have spoken it , and will do it .
and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the@@ e among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se the@@ e in the countries , and will consum@@ e TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness out of the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance in th@@ y@@ self in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dro@@ ss : all they are br@@ ass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace ; they are even the dro@@ ss of silver .
as silver is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace , so shall ye be mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st there@@ of ; and ye shall know that I the Lord have p@@ oured out my fur@@ y upon you .
there is a con@@ spir@@ acy of her pro@@ ph@@ ets in the mid@@ st there@@ of , like a ro@@ aring lion ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y ; they have dev@@ oured so@@ ul@@ s ; they have taken the treasure and pre@@ ci@@ ous things ; they have made her many wi@@ dows in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
therefore have I p@@ oured out mine in@@ dign@@ ation upon them ; I have consu@@ med them with the fire of my wr@@ ath : their own way have I re@@ compen@@ sed upon their heads , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and they committed who@@ red@@ oms in Egypt ; they committed who@@ red@@ oms in their youth : there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there they bru@@ ised the te@@ ats of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and the names of them were A@@ ho@@ lah the el@@ der , and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah her sister : and they were mine , and they b@@ are sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters . thus were their names ; Samar@@ ia is A@@ ho@@ lah , and Jer@@ usalem Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah .
thus she committed her who@@ red@@ oms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and with all on whom she do@@ ted : with all their id@@ ols she def@@ iled her@@ self .
neither left she her who@@ red@@ oms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bru@@ ised the bre@@ asts of her vir@@ gin@@ ity , and p@@ oured their wh@@ ore@@ dom upon her .
these discovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess : they took her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and sle@@ w her with the s@@ word : and she became famous among women ; for they had executed judgment upon her .
and when her sister Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah saw this , she was more corrupt in her in@@ ordinate love than she , and in her who@@ red@@ oms more than her sister in her who@@ red@@ oms .
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she do@@ ted upon them , and sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to them into Chal@@ de@@ a .
so she discovered her who@@ red@@ oms , and discovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess : then my mind was ali@@ en@@ ated from her , like as my mind was ali@@ en@@ ated from her sister .
yet she multi@@ p@@ lied her who@@ red@@ oms , in calling to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the days of her youth , where@@ in she had played the har@@ lot in the land of Egypt .
for she do@@ ted upon their param@@ ours , whose f@@ les@@ h is as the f@@ les@@ h of ass@@ es , and whose issue is like the issue of hor@@ ses .
there , O Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will raise up TH@@ Y lov@@ ers against the@@ e , from whom TH@@ Y mind is ali@@ en@@ ated , and I will bring them against the@@ e on every side ;
the Bab@@ y@@ lon@@ ians , and all the Chal@@ de@@ ans , Pek@@ od , and Sho@@ a , and Ko@@ a , and all the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans with them : all of them desi@@ ra@@ ble young men , cap@@ tains and rul@@ ers , great lor@@ ds and renowned , all of them ri@@ ding upon hor@@ ses .
thus will I make TH@@ Y le@@ w@@ d@@ ness to ce@@ ase from the@@ e , and TH@@ Y wh@@ ore@@ dom brought from the land of Egypt : so that th@@ ou s@@ halt not lift up th@@ ine eyes un@@ to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will deliver the@@ e into the hand of them whom th@@ ou ha@@ test , into the hand of them from whom TH@@ Y mind is ali@@ en@@ ated :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt be filled with dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness and sor@@ row , with the c@@ up of ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment and de@@ so@@ lation , with the c@@ up of TH@@ Y sister Samar@@ ia .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt even drink it and su@@ ck it out , and th@@ ou s@@ halt break the sh@@ er@@ ds there@@ of , and p@@ lu@@ ck off th@@ ine own bre@@ asts : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
that they have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and blood is in their hands , and with their id@@ ols have they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and have also caused their sons , whom they b@@ are un@@ to me , to pass for them through the fire , to dev@@ our them .
and furthermore , that ye have sent for men to come from far , un@@ to whom a mes@@ sen@@ ger was sent ; and , lo , they came : for whom th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st was@@ h th@@ y@@ self , pain@@ ted@@ st TH@@ Y eyes , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st th@@ y@@ self with or@@ nam@@ ents ,
yet they went in un@@ to her , as they go in un@@ to a woman that play@@ eth the har@@ lot : so went they in un@@ to A@@ ho@@ lah and un@@ to Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah , the le@@ w@@ d women .
and the righ@@ te@@ ous men , they shall judge them after the manner of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , and blood is in their hands .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall s@@ lay their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
take the choice of the flock , and bur@@ n also the b@@ ones under it , and make it bo@@ il well , and let them se@@ e@@ the the b@@ ones of it there@@ in .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Wo@@ e to the blo@@ ody city , to the po@@ t whose sc@@ um is there@@ in , and whose sc@@ um is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall up on it .
for her blood is in the mid@@ st of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she p@@ oured it not upon the ground , to cover it with d@@ ust ;
that it might cause fur@@ y to come up to take ven@@ ge@@ ance ; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
then set it empty upon the co@@ als there@@ of , that the br@@ ass of it may be hot , and may bur@@ n , and that the fil@@ th@@ iness of it may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that the sc@@ um of it may be consu@@ med .
in TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness is le@@ w@@ d@@ ness : because I have p@@ urged the@@ e , and th@@ ou w@@ ast not p@@ urged , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be p@@ urged from TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness any more , ti@@ ll I have caused my fur@@ y to rest upon the@@ e .
son of man , be@@ hold , I take away from the@@ e the desire of th@@ ine eyes with a stro@@ ke : yet neither s@@ halt th@@ ou mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall TH@@ Y te@@ ars run down .
For@@ bear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bin@@ d the tire of th@@ ine head upon the@@ e , and put on TH@@ Y sho@@ es upon TH@@ Y feet , and cover not TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and eat not the bread of men .
so I sp@@ ake un@@ to the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was comman@@ ded .
and your ti@@ res shall be upon your heads , and your sho@@ es upon your feet : ye shall not mour@@ n nor we@@ ep ; but ye shall p@@ ine away for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and mour@@ n one toward another .
in that day shall TH@@ Y m@@ outh be opened to him which is escaped , and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak , and be no more dum@@ b : and th@@ ou s@@ halt be a sign un@@ to them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
be@@ hold , therefore I will deliver the@@ e to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their pal@@ aces in the@@ e , and make their d@@ wel@@ lings in the@@ e : they shall eat TH@@ Y fruit , and they shall drink TH@@ Y milk .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast cla@@ pped th@@ ine hands , and st@@ amp@@ ed with the feet , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed in heart with all TH@@ Y despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
un@@ to the men of the east with the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and will give them in possession , that the Am@@ mon@@ ites may not be remember@@ ed among the nations .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause that E@@ dom hat@@ h dealt against the house of Ju@@ da@@ h by taking ven@@ ge@@ ance , and hat@@ h greatly off@@ ended , and reven@@ ged himself upon them ;
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon E@@ dom , and will cut off man and be@@ ast from it ; and I will make it de@@ so@@ late from Tem@@ an ; and they of D@@ ed@@ an shall fall by the s@@ word .
and I will lay my ven@@ ge@@ ance upon E@@ dom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in E@@ dom according to mine an@@ ger and according to my fur@@ y ; and they shall know my ven@@ ge@@ ance , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will stretch out mine hand upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and I will cut off the Cher@@ eth@@ ims , and destroy the re@@ mn@@ ant of the sea coast .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , O T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and will cause many nations to come up against the@@ e , as the sea ca@@ us@@ eth his waves to come up .
and they shall destroy the walls of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and break down her tow@@ ers : I will also scrap@@ e her d@@ ust from her , and make her like the top of a rock .
it shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets in the mid@@ st of the sea : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God : and it shall become a sp@@ oil to the nations .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will bring upon T@@ y@@ ru@@ s Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , a king of kings , from the north , with hor@@ ses , and with char@@ i@@ ots , and with hor@@ se@@ men , and companies , and much people .
he shall s@@ lay with the s@@ word TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in the field : and he shall make a For@@ t against the@@ e , and cast a mount against the@@ e , and lift up the bu@@ ck@@ ler against the@@ e .
and he shall set eng@@ ines of war against TH@@ Y walls , and with his ax@@ es he shall break down TH@@ Y tow@@ ers .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all TH@@ Y streets : he shall s@@ lay TH@@ Y people by the s@@ word , and TH@@ Y strong gar@@ ris@@ ons shall go down to the ground .
and they shall make a sp@@ oil of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise : and they shall break down TH@@ Y walls , and destroy TH@@ Y pleas@@ ant houses : and they shall lay TH@@ Y stones and TH@@ Y tim@@ ber and TH@@ Y d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the water .
and I will cause the no@@ ise of TH@@ Y songs to ce@@ ase ; and the sound of TH@@ Y har@@ ps shall be no more heard .
and I will make the@@ e like the top of a rock : th@@ ou s@@ halt be a place to spread n@@ ets upon ; th@@ ou s@@ halt be built no more : for I the Lord have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God to T@@ y@@ ru@@ s ; shall not the is@@ les shake at the sound of TH@@ Y fall , when the wounded cry , when the sla@@ ughter is made in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ?
then all the pr@@ inces of the sea shall come down from their th@@ ron@@ es , and lay away their rob@@ es , and put off their bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments : they shall clo@@ the themselves with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble at every moment , and be ast@@ on@@ ished at the@@ e .
now shall the is@@ les tre@@ m@@ ble in the day of TH@@ Y fall ; ye@@ a , the is@@ les that are in the sea shall be troubled at TH@@ Y departure .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; When I shall make the@@ e a de@@ so@@ late city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon the@@ e , and great waters shall cover the@@ e ;
and say un@@ to T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , O th@@ ou that art situ@@ ate at the entry of the sea , which art a mer@@ chan@@ t of the people for many is@@ les , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; O T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , th@@ ou h@@ ast said , I am of perfect beauty .
of the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an have they made th@@ ine o@@ ars ; the company of the As@@ hur@@ ites have made TH@@ Y ben@@ ches of Iv@@ ory , brought out of the is@@ les of Ch@@ it@@ tim .
fine lin@@ en with bro@@ i@@ dered work from Egypt was that which th@@ ou sp@@ re@@ ade@@ st forth to be TH@@ Y sa@@ il ; blue and pur@@ ple from the is@@ les of E@@ lis@@ ha@@ h was that which covered the@@ e .
the inhabitants of Z@@ id@@ on and Ar@@ v@@ ad were TH@@ Y mar@@ in@@ ers : TH@@ Y wise men , O T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , that were in the@@ e , were TH@@ Y pil@@ ots .
they of Per@@ sia and of Lu@@ d and of Ph@@ ut were in th@@ ine army , TH@@ Y men of war : they han@@ ged the shield and hel@@ met in the@@ e ; they set forth TH@@ Y co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with th@@ ine army were upon TH@@ Y walls round about , and the G@@ am@@ ma@@ di@@ ms were in TH@@ Y tow@@ ers : they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds upon TH@@ Y walls round about ; they have made TH@@ Y beauty perfect .
Ju@@ da@@ h , and the land of Israel , they were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts : they tra@@ ded in TH@@ Y market wheat of Min@@ n@@ ith , and P@@ ann@@ a@@ g , and hon@@ ey , and oil , and bal@@ m .
Arabia , and all the pr@@ inces of K@@ ed@@ ar , they occupied with the@@ e in lam@@ bs , and r@@ ams , and go@@ ats : in these were they TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts .
these were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts in all sor@@ ts of things , in blue clo@@ th@@ es , and bro@@ i@@ dered work , and in ch@@ ests of rich appar@@ el , bound with cor@@ ds , and made of c@@ ed@@ ar , among TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish did sing of the@@ e in TH@@ Y market : and th@@ ou w@@ ast rep@@ len@@ ished , and made very g@@ lor@@ ious in the mid@@ st of the seas .
and all that handle the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , and all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against the@@ e , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust upon their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves ut@@ ter@@ ly bal@@ d for the@@ e , and gir@@ d them with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and they shall we@@ ep for the@@ e with bit@@ ter@@ ness of heart and bitter w@@ ailing .
and in their w@@ ailing they shall take up a lament@@ ation for the@@ e , and la@@ ment over the@@ e , saying , What city is like T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , like the destroyed in the mid@@ st of the sea ?
when TH@@ Y war@@ es went forth out of the seas , th@@ ou fil@@ led@@ st many people ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st en@@ rich the kings of the ear@@ th with the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches and of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
in the time when th@@ ou s@@ halt be broken by the seas in the dep@@ ths of the waters TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise and all TH@@ Y company in the mid@@ st of the@@ e shall fall .
all the inhabitants of the is@@ les shall be ast@@ on@@ ished at the@@ e , and their kings shall be sor@@ e afraid , they shall be troubled in their coun@@ tenance .
by TH@@ Y great wis@@ dom and by TH@@ Y traffic@@ k h@@ ast th@@ ou increased TH@@ Y ri@@ ches , and th@@ ine heart is lifted up because of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches :
be@@ hold , therefore I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers upon the@@ e , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations : and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile TH@@ Y bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
they shall bring the@@ e down to the p@@ it , and th@@ ou s@@ halt die the deaths of them that are sla@@ in in the mid@@ st of the seas .
Wil@@ t th@@ ou yet say before him that s@@ lay@@ eth the@@ e , I am God ? but th@@ ou s@@ halt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that s@@ lay@@ eth the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u art the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set the@@ e so : th@@ ou w@@ ast upon the hol@@ y mountain of God ; th@@ ou h@@ ast walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ ast perfect in TH@@ Y ways from the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast created , ti@@ ll in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity was found in the@@ e .
Th@@ ine heart was lifted up because of TH@@ Y beauty , th@@ ou h@@ ast cor@@ rupted TH@@ Y wis@@ dom by reason of TH@@ Y bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness : I will cast the@@ e to the ground , I will lay the@@ e before kings , that they may be@@ hold the@@ e .
for I will send into her p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be jud@@ ged in the mid@@ st of her by the s@@ word upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and there shall be no more a pri@@ cking bri@@ er un@@ to the house of Israel , nor any gri@@ ev@@ ing Th@@ or@@ n of all that are round about them , that desp@@ ised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord God .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are sc@@ at@@ tered , and shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , then shall they d@@ well in their land that I have given to my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twel@@ f@@ th day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
but I will put ho@@ oks in TH@@ Y j@@ a@@ ws , and I will cause the fish of TH@@ Y rivers to stick un@@ to TH@@ Y scal@@ es , and I will bring the@@ e up out of the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y rivers , and all the fish of TH@@ Y rivers shall stick un@@ to TH@@ Y scal@@ es .
and I will leave the@@ e thrown into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , the@@ e and all the fish of TH@@ Y rivers : th@@ ou s@@ halt fall upon the open fields ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not be brought together , nor gathered : I have given the@@ e for meat to the be@@ asts of the field and to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en .
when they took hold of the@@ e by TH@@ Y hand , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st break , and ren@@ d all their sho@@ ul@@ der : and when they le@@ an@@ ed upon the@@ e , th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est , and ma@@ dest all their lo@@ ins to be at a stand .
and the land of Egypt shall be de@@ so@@ late and waste ; and they shall know that I am the Lord : because he hat@@ h said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
be@@ hold , therefore I am against the@@ e , and against TH@@ Y rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt ut@@ ter@@ ly waste and de@@ so@@ late , from the to@@ wer of S@@ yen@@ e even un@@ to the border of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
and I will make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be de@@ so@@ late for@@ ty years : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their habi@@ tation ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will give the land of Egypt un@@ to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and he shall take her multi@@ tude , and take her sp@@ oil , and take her pre@@ y ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause the Hor@@ n of the house of Israel to bu@@ d forth , and I will give the@@ e the opening of the m@@ outh in the mid@@ st of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
for the day is near , even the day of the Lord is near , a cl@@ ou@@ dy day ; it shall be the time of the he@@ a@@ then .
and the s@@ word shall come upon Egypt , and great p@@ ain shall be in Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , when the sla@@ in shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multi@@ tude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , and Libya , and Ly@@ dia , and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and Ch@@ u@@ b , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the s@@ word .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; They also that up@@ hold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the to@@ wer of S@@ yen@@ e shall they fall in it by the s@@ word , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and they shall be de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late , and her cities shall be in the mid@@ st of the cities that are was@@ ted .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her hel@@ pers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall mes@@ sen@@ gers go forth from me in ships to make the car@@ ele@@ ss Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians afraid , and great p@@ ain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it co@@ me@@ th .
he and his people with him , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sla@@ in .
and I will make the rivers d@@ ry , and sell the land into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is there@@ in , by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : I the Lord have spoken it .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will also destroy the id@@ ols , and I will cause their images to ce@@ ase out of N@@ op@@ h ; and there shall be no more a pr@@ ince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
and I will p@@ our my fur@@ y upon sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multi@@ tude of No .
at Te@@ ha@@ ph@@ ne@@ hes also the day shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed , when I shall break there the yok@@ es of Egypt : and the pom@@ p of her strength shall ce@@ ase in her : as for her , a cl@@ oud shall cover her , and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall go into cap@@ tivity .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be he@@ aled , to put a rol@@ ler to bin@@ d it , to make it strong to hold the s@@ word .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I am against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the s@@ word to fall out of his hand .
and I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put my s@@ word in his hand : but I will break P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's arms , and he shall gro@@ an before him with the gro@@ an@@ ings of a deadly wounded man .
be@@ hold , the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an was a c@@ ed@@ ar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shad@@ owing sh@@ ro@@ ud , and of an high stat@@ ure ; and his top was among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
the waters made him great , the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants , and sent out her little rivers un@@ to all the trees of the field .
therefore his he@@ ight was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and his branches became long because of the multi@@ tude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en made their nes@@ ts in his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and under his branches did all the be@@ asts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
I have made him fair by the multi@@ tude of his branches : so that all the trees of E@@ den , that were in the gar@@ den of God , en@@ vi@@ ed him .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast lifted up th@@ y@@ self in he@@ ight , and he hat@@ h shot up his top among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and his heart is lifted up in his he@@ ight ;
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the he@@ a@@ then ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him : I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
upon his ru@@ in shall all the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en remain , and all the be@@ asts of the field shall be upon his branches :
they also went down into hell with him un@@ to them that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the he@@ a@@ then .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will therefore spread out my net over the@@ e with a company of many people ; and they shall bring the@@ e up in my net .
then will I leave the@@ e upon the land , I will cast the@@ e forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en to remain upon the@@ e , and I will fill the be@@ asts of the whole ear@@ th with the@@ e .
I will also water with TH@@ Y blood the land where@@ in th@@ ou swim@@ me@@ st , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of the@@ e .
and when I shall put the@@ e out , I will cover the heav@@ en , and make the stars there@@ of dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give her light .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause TH@@ Y multi@@ tude to fall , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , all of them : and they shall sp@@ oil the pom@@ p of Egypt , and all the multi@@ tude there@@ of shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all the be@@ asts there@@ of from bes@@ ide the great waters ; neither shall the fo@@ ot of man trouble them any more , nor the ho@@ of@@ s of be@@ asts trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late , and the country shall be de@@ stitute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
this is the lament@@ ation where@@ with they shall la@@ ment her : the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the nations shall la@@ ment her : they shall la@@ ment for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multi@@ tude , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
it came to pass also in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , un@@ to the ne@@ ther parts of the ear@@ th , with them that go down into the p@@ it .
they shall fall in the mid@@ st of them that are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : she is delivered to the s@@ word : draw her and all her multi@@ tu@@ des .
whose graves are set in the sides of the p@@ it , and her company is round about her grave : all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Mes@@ h@@ ech , T@@ ub@@ al , and all her multi@@ tude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings , and all her pr@@ inces , which with their might are laid by them that were sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with them that go down to the p@@ it .
for I have caused my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be laid in the mid@@ st of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised with them that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his multi@@ tude , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
son of man , speak to the children of TH@@ Y people , and say un@@ to them , When I bring the s@@ word upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their co@@ asts , and set him for their watch@@ man :
then wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he@@ aret@@ h the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and tak@@ eth not warning ; if the s@@ word come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
so th@@ ou , O son of man , I have set the@@ e a watch@@ man un@@ to the house of Israel ; therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt hear the word at my m@@ outh , and warn them from me .
when I say un@@ to the w@@ ic@@ ked , O w@@ ic@@ ked man , th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die ; if th@@ ou dost not speak to warn the w@@ ic@@ ked from his way , that w@@ ic@@ ked man shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but his blood will I require at th@@ ine hand .
nevertheless , if th@@ ou warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
again , when I say un@@ to the w@@ ic@@ ked , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is law@@ ful and right ;
if the w@@ ic@@ ked restore the pledge , give again that he had ro@@ bbed , walk in the stat@@ utes of life , without committing in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
none of his sin@@ s that he hat@@ h committed shall be mentioned un@@ to him : he hat@@ h done that which is law@@ ful and right ; he shall su@@ rely live .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ f@@ th year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jer@@ usalem came un@@ to me , saying , The city is s@@ mit@@ ten .
for I will lay the land most de@@ so@@ late , and the pom@@ p of her strength shall ce@@ ase ; and the mountains of Israel shall be de@@ so@@ late , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I have laid the land most de@@ so@@ late because of all their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
and , lo , th@@ ou art un@@ to them as a very lov@@ ely song of one that hat@@ h a pleas@@ ant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear TH@@ Y words , but they do them not .
and when this co@@ me@@ th to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a pro@@ phe@@ t hat@@ h been among them .
son of man , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y against the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds of Israel , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ; Wo@@ e be to the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds of Israel that do fe@@ ed themselves ! should not the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds fe@@ ed the f@@ loc@@ ks ?
Y@@ e eat the f@@ at , and ye clo@@ the you with the wo@@ ol , ye kill them that are f@@ ed : but ye fe@@ ed not the flock .
and they were sc@@ at@@ tered , because there is no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : and they became meat to all the be@@ asts of the field , when they were sc@@ at@@ tered .
my she@@ ep w@@ and@@ ered through all the mountains , and upon every high hill : ye@@ a , my flock was sc@@ at@@ tered upon all the face of the ear@@ th , and none did search or seek after them .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely because my flock became a pre@@ y , and my flock became meat to every be@@ ast of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my flock , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and f@@ ed not my flock ;
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and fe@@ ed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will fe@@ ed them in a good pas@@ ture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a f@@ at pas@@ ture shall they fe@@ ed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bin@@ d up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was si@@ ck : but I will destroy the f@@ at and the strong ; I will fe@@ ed them with judgment .
Se@@ eme@@ th it a small thing un@@ to you to have e@@ aten up the good pas@@ ture , but ye must tre@@ ad down with your feet the resi@@ due of your pas@@ tures ? and to have dr@@ un@@ k of the deep waters , but ye must f@@ oul the resi@@ due with your feet ?
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have tro@@ dden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
and I will set up one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d over them , and he shall fe@@ ed them , even my ser@@ vant David ; he shall fe@@ ed them , and he shall be their she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and I will make with them a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace , and will cause the ev@@ il be@@ asts to ce@@ ase out of the land : and they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sle@@ ep in the wo@@ ods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in his season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
and they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the he@@ a@@ then , neither shall the be@@ ast of the land dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with hunger in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the he@@ a@@ then any more .
and say un@@ to it , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , O mount Se@@ ir , I am against the@@ e , and I will stretch out mine hand against the@@ e , and I will make the@@ e most de@@ so@@ late .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast had a perpet@@ ual hatred , and h@@ ast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the s@@ word in the time of their cal@@ am@@ ity , in the time that their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity had an end :
therefore , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , I will prepare the@@ e un@@ to blood , and blood shall pursue the@@ e : s@@ ith th@@ ou h@@ ast not ha@@ ted blood , even blood shall pursue the@@ e .
and I will fill his mountains with his sla@@ in men : in TH@@ Y hil@@ ls , and in TH@@ Y val@@ ley@@ s , and in all TH@@ Y rivers , shall they fall that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all TH@@ Y b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid de@@ so@@ late , they are given us to consum@@ e .
thus with your m@@ outh ye have bo@@ asted against me , and have multi@@ p@@ lied your words against me : I have heard them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I have lifted up mine hand , su@@ rely the he@@ a@@ then that are about you , they shall bear their sh@@ ame .
for , be@@ hold , I am for you , and I will turn un@@ to you , and ye shall be til@@ led and so@@ wn :
and I will multi@@ ply men upon you , all the house of Israel , even all of it : and the cities shall be inhabited , and the was@@ tes shall be buil@@ ded :
Ye@@ a , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall poss@@ ess the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be their inher@@ it@@ ance , and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more hen@@ ce@@ forth ber@@ e@@ ave them of men .
neither will I cause men to hear in the@@ e the sh@@ ame of the he@@ a@@ then any more , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of the people any more , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou cause TH@@ Y nations to fall any more , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
son of man , when the house of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their own land , they def@@ iled it by their own way and by their do@@ ings : their way was before me as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of a removed woman .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I p@@ oured my fur@@ y upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their id@@ ols where@@ with they had pollu@@ ted it :
and I sc@@ at@@ tered them among the he@@ a@@ then , and they were disper@@ sed through the countries : according to their way and according to their do@@ ings I jud@@ ged them .
and when they entered un@@ to the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther they went , they prof@@ an@@ ed my hol@@ y name , when they said to them , These are the people of the Lord , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had p@@ ity for mine hol@@ y name , which the house of Israel had prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther they went .
therefore say un@@ to the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I do not this for your sak@@ es , O house of Israel , but for mine hol@@ y name 's sake , which ye have prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther ye went .
for I will take you from among the he@@ a@@ then , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you an heart of f@@ les@@ h .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my stat@@ utes , and ye shall keep my judg@@ ments , and do them .
and ye shall d@@ well in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers ; and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will also save you from all your un@@ cle@@ ann@@ esses : and I will call for the cor@@ n , and will increase it , and lay no fam@@ ine upon you .
and I will multi@@ ply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more re@@ pro@@ ach of fam@@ ine among the he@@ a@@ then .
then shall ye remember your own ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good , and shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleans@@ ed you from all your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities I will also cause you to d@@ well in the cities , and the was@@ tes shall be buil@@ ded .
and the de@@ so@@ late land shall be til@@ led , whereas it lay de@@ so@@ late in the sight of all that passed by .
then the he@@ a@@ then that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord build the ru@@ ined places , and plant that that was de@@ so@@ late : I the Lord have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the hol@@ y flock , as the flock of Jer@@ usalem in her so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ loc@@ ks of men : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley which was full of b@@ ones ,
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , be@@ hold , there were very many in the open val@@ ley ; and , lo , they were very d@@ ry .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God un@@ to these b@@ ones ; be@@ hold , I will cause bre@@ ath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and I will lay sin@@ ews upon you , and will bring up f@@ les@@ h upon you , and cover you with s@@ kin , and put bre@@ ath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
so I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied as I was comman@@ ded : and as I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , there was a no@@ ise , and be@@ hold a shak@@ ing , and the b@@ ones came together , bone to his bone .
and when I be@@ held , lo , the sin@@ ews and the f@@ les@@ h came up upon them , and the s@@ kin covered them above : but there was no bre@@ ath in them .
therefore pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it , and performed it , sa@@ ith the Lord .
moreover , th@@ ou son of man , take the@@ e one stick , and write upon it , For Ju@@ da@@ h , and for the children of Israel his compan@@ ions : then take another stick , and write upon it , For Joseph , the stick of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and for all the house of Israel his compan@@ ions :
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms any more at all :
neither shall they def@@ ile themselves any more with their id@@ ols , nor with their de@@ te@@ stable things , nor with any of their trans@@ gres@@ sions : but I will save them out of all their d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places , where@@ in they have sin@@ ned , and will cleans@@ e them : so shall they be my people , and I will be their God .
and David my ser@@ vant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : they shall also walk in my judg@@ ments , and observe my stat@@ utes , and do them .
and they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , where@@ in your fa@@ thers have d@@ wel@@ t ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my ser@@ vant David shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
moreover I will make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace with them ; it shall be an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them : and I will place them , and multi@@ ply them , and will set my sanc@@ tu@@ ary in the mid@@ st of them for ever@@ more .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt as@@ cen@@ d and come like a storm , th@@ ou s@@ halt be like a cl@@ oud to cover the land , th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y bands , and many people with the@@ e .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; It shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall things come into TH@@ Y mind , and th@@ ou s@@ halt think an ev@@ il thought :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come from TH@@ Y place out of the north parts , th@@ ou , and many people with the@@ e , all of them ri@@ ding upon hor@@ ses , a great company , and a m@@ igh@@ ty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that my fur@@ y shall come up in my face .
for in my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and in the fire of my wr@@ ath have I spoken , su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shak@@ ing in the land of Israel ;
and I will call for a s@@ word against him throughout all my mountains , sa@@ ith the Lord God : every man 's s@@ word shall be against his brother .
and I will p@@ lead against him with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an over@@ flow@@ ing rain , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and bri@@ m@@ stone .
and I will turn the@@ e back , and leave but the sixth part of the@@ e , and will cause the@@ e to come up from the north parts , and will bring the@@ e upon the mountains of Israel :
and I will sm@@ ite TH@@ Y bo@@ w out of TH@@ Y left hand , and will cause th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws to fall out of TH@@ Y right hand .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fall upon the mountains of Israel , th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y bands , and the people that is with the@@ e : I will give the@@ e un@@ to the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of every sort , and to the be@@ asts of the field to be dev@@ oured .
so will I make my hol@@ y name known in the mid@@ st of my people Israel ; and I will not let them poll@@ ute my hol@@ y name any more : and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I am the Lord , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall bur@@ n the weapons with fire : and they shall sp@@ oil those that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and ro@@ b those that ro@@ bbed them , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and the passengers that pass through the land , when any se@@ eth a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , ti@@ ll the bur@@ i@@ ers have buried it in the val@@ ley of Ham@@ on @@@ -@@ @ go@@ g .
and ye shall eat f@@ at ti@@ ll ye be full , and drink blood ti@@ ll ye be dr@@ un@@ ken , of my sacrifice which I have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for you .
and I will set my gl@@ ory among the he@@ a@@ then , and all the he@@ a@@ then shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid upon them .
and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that the house of Israel went into cap@@ tivity for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : because they t@@ res@@ passed against me , therefore hi@@ d I my face from them , and gave them into the hand of their enem@@ ies : so fell they all by the s@@ word .
according to their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and according to their trans@@ gres@@ sions have I done un@@ to them , and hi@@ d my face from them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Now will I bring again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b , and have mer@@ cy upon the whole house of Israel , and will be Je@@ al@@ ous for my hol@@ y name ;
after that they have bor@@ ne their sh@@ ame , and all their t@@ res@@ passes where@@ by they have t@@ res@@ passed against me , when they d@@ wel@@ t saf@@ ely in their land , and none made them afraid .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enem@@ ies ' lands , and am sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them un@@ to their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year after that the city was s@@ mit@@ ten , in the sel@@ f@@ same day the hand of the Lord was upon me , and brought me th@@ ither .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and he brought me th@@ ither , and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he un@@ to the gate which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east , and went up the st@@ airs there@@ of , and meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , which was one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one Re@@ ed broad .
then meas@@ ured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the posts there@@ of , two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was in@@ ward .
the space also before the little ch@@ ambers was one cu@@ bit on this side , and the space was one cu@@ bit on that side : and the little ch@@ ambers were six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
he meas@@ ured then the gate from the ro@@ of of one little chamber to the ro@@ of of another : the b@@ read@@ th was five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , door against door .
and from the face of the gate of the entrance un@@ to the face of the por@@ ch of the in@@ ner gate were fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
then he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the lower gate un@@ to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner court without , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts eas@@ tw@@ ard and nor@@ th@@ ward .
and the gate of the ou@@ tw@@ ard court that looked toward the north , he meas@@ ured the length there@@ of , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts there@@ of and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were after the measure of the first gate : the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and their windows , and their ar@@ ches , and their pal@@ m trees , were after the measure of the gate that lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east ; and they went up un@@ to it by seven steps ; and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them : and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts there@@ of .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and the posts there@@ of , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the ar@@ ches there@@ of round about : it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and the posts there@@ of , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of , were according to these measures : and there were windows there@@ in and in the ar@@ ches there@@ of round about : it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were toward the ou@@ tw@@ ard court ; and pal@@ m trees were upon the posts there@@ of , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts there@@ of were toward the ut@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were upon the posts there@@ of , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and in the por@@ ch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to s@@ lay there@@ on the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sin offering and the t@@ res@@ pass offering .
and at the side without , as one go@@ eth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , where@@ upon they sle@@ w their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
and without the in@@ ner gate were the ch@@ ambers of the singers in the in@@ ner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and he said un@@ to me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the pri@@ ests , the ke@@ epers of the charge of the house .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the pri@@ ests , the ke@@ epers of the charge of the alt@@ ar : these are the sons of Zad@@ ok among the sons of L@@ evi , which come near to the Lord to minister un@@ to him .
and he brought me to the por@@ ch of the house , and meas@@ ured each post of the por@@ ch , five cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side : and the b@@ read@@ th of the gate was three cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and three cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
after@@ ward he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
after he meas@@ ured the wall of the house , six cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the b@@ read@@ th of every side chamber , four cu@@ bi@@ ts , round about the house on every side .
and the doors of the side ch@@ ambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was sev@@ enty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; and the wall of the building was five cu@@ bi@@ ts th@@ ick round about , and the length there@@ of n@@ in@@ ety cu@@ bi@@ ts .
also the b@@ read@@ th of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he meas@@ ured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies there@@ of on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , with the in@@ ner temp@@ le , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
the door posts , and the narrow windows , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies round about on their three stories , over against the door , ci@@ eled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ;
to that above the door , even un@@ to the in@@ ner house , and without , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
so that the face of a man was toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
the posts of the temp@@ le were s@@ quar@@ ed , and the face of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
the alt@@ ar of wood was three cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and the length there@@ of two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the cor@@ ners there@@ of , and the length there@@ of , and the walls there@@ of , were of wood : and he said un@@ to me , This is the table that is before the Lord .
and the doors had two leaves ap@@ i@@ ece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temp@@ le , ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms and pal@@ m trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were th@@ ick plan@@ ks upon the face of the por@@ ch without .
and there were narrow windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side ch@@ ambers of the house , and th@@ ick plan@@ ks .
then he brought me forth into the ut@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
over against the twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts which were for the in@@ ner court , and over against the pav@@ ement which was for the ut@@ ter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and the wall that was without over against the ch@@ ambers , toward the ut@@ ter court on the fore@@ part of the ch@@ ambers , the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the ch@@ ambers were in the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
now when he had made an end of measuring the in@@ ner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and meas@@ ured it round about .
and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a no@@ ise of many waters : and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell upon my face .
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the in@@ ner court ; and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house .
now let them put away their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the car@@ cases of their kings , far from me , and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of them for ever .
T@@ ho@@ u son of man , she@@ w the house to the house of Israel , that they may be as@@ ha@@ med of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities : and let them measure the pat@@ tern .
this is the law of the house ; U@@ p@@ on the top of the mountain the whole limit there@@ of round about shall be most hol@@ y . be@@ hold , this is the law of the house .
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th one cu@@ bit ; and from the les@@ ser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th one cu@@ bit .
and the settle shall be fo@@ ur@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts long and fo@@ ur@@ teen broad in the four s@@ quar@@ es there@@ of ; and the border about it shall be half a cu@@ bit ; and the bottom there@@ of shall be a cu@@ bit about ; and his st@@ airs shall look toward the east .
and he said un@@ to me , Son of man , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; These are the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the alt@@ ar in the day when they shall make it , to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on , and to sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le blood there@@ on .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes that be of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , which approach un@@ to me , to minister un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord God , a young bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the blood there@@ of , and put it on the four hor@@ ns of it , and on the four cor@@ ners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus s@@ halt th@@ ou cleans@@ e and pur@@ ge it .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt take the bul@@ lock also of the sin offering , and he shall bur@@ n it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
and on the second day th@@ ou s@@ halt offer a k@@ id of the go@@ ats without ble@@ mis@@ h for a sin offering ; and they shall cleans@@ e the alt@@ ar , as they did cleans@@ e it with the bul@@ lock .
when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of cleansing it , th@@ ou s@@ halt offer a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram out of the flock without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer them before the Lord , and the pri@@ ests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the pri@@ ests shall make your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings upon the alt@@ ar , and your peace offer@@ ings ; and I will accept you , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
then said the Lord un@@ to me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the Lord , the God of Israel , hat@@ h entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the pr@@ ince ; the pr@@ ince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt say to the rebel@@ li@@ ous , even to the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; O ye house of Israel , let it su@@ ffic@@ e you of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations ,
in that ye have brought into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary st@@ ran@@ gers , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart , and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , to be in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , to poll@@ ute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the f@@ at and the blood , and they have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant because of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine hol@@ y things : but ye have set ke@@ epers of my charge in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; No st@@ ran@@ ger , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart , nor un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , of any st@@ ran@@ ger that is among the children of Israel .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes that are gone away far from me , when Israel went as@@ tra@@ y , which went as@@ tra@@ y away from me after their id@@ ols ; they shall even bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
because they minist@@ ered un@@ to them before their id@@ ols , and caused the house of Israel to fall into in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them , sa@@ ith the Lord God , and they shall bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
and they shall not come near un@@ to me , to do the office of a pri@@ est un@@ to me , nor to come near to any of my hol@@ y things , in the most hol@@ y place : but they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
but I will make them ke@@ epers of the charge of the house , for all the service there@@ of , and for all that shall be done there@@ in .
they shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister un@@ to me , and they shall keep my charge .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the in@@ ner court , they shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en gar@@ ments ; and no wo@@ ol shall come upon them , wh@@ il@@ es they minister in the gates of the in@@ ner court , and within .
they shall have lin@@ en bon@@ n@@ ets upon their heads , and shall have lin@@ en bre@@ eches upon their lo@@ ins ; they shall not gir@@ d themselves with any thing that ca@@ us@@ eth swe@@ at .
neither shall they take for their wi@@ ves a wi@@ dow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take ma@@ i@@ den@@ s of the se@@ ed of the house of Israel , or a wi@@ dow that had a pri@@ est before .
and they shall te@@ ach my people the difference between the hol@@ y and prof@@ ane , and cause them to dis@@ cer@@ n between the un@@ clean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judg@@ ments : and they shall keep my laws and my stat@@ utes in all mine assemb@@ lies ; and they shall hal@@ low my sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths .
and they shall come at no dead person to def@@ ile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hat@@ h had no husband , they may def@@ ile themselves .
and in the day that he go@@ eth into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , un@@ to the in@@ ner court , to minister in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he shall offer his sin offering , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and the first of all the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of all things , and every ob@@ lation of all , of every sort of your ob@@ lations , shall be the pri@@ est 's : ye shall also give un@@ to the pri@@ est the first of your d@@ ough , that he may cause the b@@ les@@ sing to rest in th@@ ine house .
moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inher@@ it@@ ance , ye shall offer an ob@@ lation un@@ to the Lord , an hol@@ y portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand re@@ eds , and the b@@ read@@ th shall be ten thousand . this shall be hol@@ y in all the borders there@@ of round about .
of this there shall be for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary five hundred in length , with five hundred in b@@ read@@ th , square round about ; and fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts round about for the subur@@ bs there@@ of .
and of this measure s@@ halt th@@ ou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the b@@ read@@ th of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the most hol@@ y place .
the hol@@ y portion of the land shall be for the pri@@ ests the ministers of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which shall come near to minister un@@ to the Lord : and it shall be a place for their houses , and an hol@@ y place for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
in the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my pr@@ inces shall no more op@@ press my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tri@@ bes .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the b@@ ath shall be of one measure , that the b@@ ath may contain the tenth part of an Ho@@ mer , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of an Ho@@ mer : the measure there@@ of shall be after the Ho@@ mer .
this is the ob@@ lation that ye shall offer ; the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of an Ho@@ mer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of an Ho@@ mer of bar@@ ley :
concerning the ordin@@ ance of oil , the b@@ ath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a b@@ ath out of the C@@ or , which is an Ho@@ mer of ten ba@@ ths ; for ten ba@@ ths are an Ho@@ mer :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , th@@ ou s@@ halt take a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and cleans@@ e the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four cor@@ ners of the settle of the alt@@ ar , and upon the posts of the gate of the in@@ ner court .
and so th@@ ou s@@ halt do the seventh day of the month for every one that er@@ re@@ th , and for him that is simple : so shall ye reconc@@ ile the house .
in the first month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , ye shall have the pass@@ over , a feast of seven days ; un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering to the Lord , seven bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h daily the seven days ; and a k@@ id of the go@@ ats daily for a sin offering .
in the seventh month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; The gate of the in@@ ner court that lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord in the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths and in the new mo@@ ons .
and the bur@@ n@@ t offering that the pr@@ ince shall offer un@@ to the Lord in the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day shall be six lam@@ bs without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram : they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and he shall prepare a meat offering , an ep@@ ha@@ h for a bul@@ lock , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for a ram , and for the lam@@ bs according as his hand shall at@@ tain un@@ to , and an hin of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
and when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way there@@ of .
and the pr@@ ince in the mid@@ st of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
moreover the pr@@ ince shall not take of the people 's inher@@ it@@ ance by op@@ pression , to th@@ rust them out of their possession ; but he shall give his sons inher@@ it@@ ance out of his own possession : that my people be not sc@@ at@@ tered every man from his possession .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y ch@@ ambers of the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and , be@@ hold , there was a place on the two sides w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then he brought me forth into the ut@@ ter court , and caused me to pass by the four cor@@ ners of the court ; and , be@@ hold , in every cor@@ ner of the court there was a court .
and there was a row of building round about in them , round about them four , and it was made with bo@@ iling places under the ro@@ ws round about .
then said he un@@ to me , These are the places of them that bo@@ il , where the ministers of the house shall bo@@ il the sacrifice of the people .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me about the way without un@@ to the ut@@ ter gate by the way that lo@@ ok@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and , be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eas@@ tw@@ ard , he meas@@ ured a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the an@@ c@@ les .
again he meas@@ ured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the k@@ ne@@ es . again he meas@@ ured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the lo@@ ins .
after@@ ward he meas@@ ured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to sw@@ im in , a river that could not be passed over .
now when I had returned , be@@ hold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
and it shall come to pass , that the fis@@ hers shall stand upon it from En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di even un@@ to En @@@ -@@ @ eg@@ la@@ im ; they shall be a place to spread forth n@@ ets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
and ye shall inher@@ it it , one as well as another : concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it un@@ to your fa@@ thers : and this land shall fall un@@ to you for inher@@ it@@ ance .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of H@@ eth@@ lon , as men go to Z@@ ed@@ ad ;
Ham@@ ath , Ber@@ o@@ th@@ ah , Si@@ bra@@ im , which is between the border of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the border of Ham@@ ath ; Hazar @@@ -@@ @ hat@@ tic@@ on , which is by the coast of H@@ aur@@ an .
and these shall be the measures there@@ of ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
and the subur@@ bs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred and fif@@ ty .
and the resi@@ due in length over against the ob@@ lation of the hol@@ y portion shall be ten thousand eas@@ tw@@ ard , and ten thousand w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard : and it shall be over against the ob@@ lation of the hol@@ y portion ; and the increase there@@ of shall be for food un@@ to them that serve the city .
moreover from the possession of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and from the possession of the city , being in the mid@@ st of that which is the pr@@ ince 's , between the border of Ju@@ da@@ h and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the pr@@ ince .
and by the border of G@@ ad , at the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , the border shall be even from Tam@@ ar un@@ to the waters of stri@@ fe in K@@ ade@@ sh , and to the river toward the great sea .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Simeon , one gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred , with their three gates ; one gate of G@@ ad , one gate of As@@ her , one gate of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
and the Lord gave Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar to the house of his go@@ d ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his go@@ d .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he d@@ rank : so no@@ ur@@ ishing them three years , that at the end there@@ of they might stand before the king .
un@@ to whom the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names : for he gave un@@ to Daniel the name of Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , of Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , of Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go .
then let our coun@@ ten@@ ances be looked upon before the@@ e , and the coun@@ tenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as th@@ ou se@@ est , deal with TH@@ Y servants .
and at the end of ten days their coun@@ ten@@ ances appeared fa@@ i@@ rer and fat@@ ter in f@@ les@@ h than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s brought them in before Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
and in all matters of wis@@ dom and understanding , that the king inqu@@ ired of them , he found them ten times better than all the mag@@ ic@@ ians and astr@@ olog@@ ers that were in all his real@@ m .
and in the second year of the reign of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar dre@@ amed dre@@ ams , where@@ with his spirit was troubled , and his sle@@ ep br@@ ake from him .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the astr@@ olog@@ ers , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for to she@@ w the king his dre@@ ams . so they came and stood before the king .
the king answ@@ ered and said to the Chal@@ de@@ ans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known un@@ to me the dream , with the interpre@@ tation there@@ of , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
and it is a rare thing that the king require@@ th , and there is none other that can she@@ w it before the king , except the go@@ ds , whose d@@ wel@@ ling is not with f@@ les@@ h .
for this cause the king was angry and very fur@@ ious , and comman@@ ded to destroy all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then Daniel answ@@ ered with coun@@ sel and wis@@ dom to Ari@@ o@@ ch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to s@@ lay the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
then Daniel went in , and desi@@ red of the king that he would give him time , and that he would she@@ w the king the interpre@@ tation .
and he chan@@ get@@ h the times and the se@@ as@@ ons : he remov@@ eth kings , and set@@ te@@ th up kings : he gi@@ vet@@ h wis@@ dom un@@ to the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding :
I than@@ k the@@ e , and praise the@@ e , O th@@ ou God of my fa@@ thers , who h@@ ast given me wis@@ dom and might , and h@@ ast made known un@@ to me now what we desi@@ red of the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast now made known un@@ to us the king 's matter .
therefore Daniel went in un@@ to Ari@@ o@@ ch , whom the king had or@@ da@@ ined to destroy the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on : he went and said thus un@@ to him ; D@@ est@@ ro@@ y not the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on : bring me in before the king , and I will she@@ w un@@ to the king the interpre@@ tation .
then Ari@@ o@@ ch brought in Daniel before the king in has@@ te and said thus un@@ to him , I have found a man of the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , that will make known un@@ to the king the interpre@@ tation .
Daniel answ@@ ered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hat@@ h demanded can@@ not the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , she@@ w un@@ to the king ;
but there is a God in heav@@ en that reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts , and mak@@ eth known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . TH@@ Y dream , and the visions of TH@@ Y head upon TH@@ Y bed , are these ;
as for the@@ e , O king , TH@@ Y th@@ ou@@ ghts came into TH@@ Y mind upon TH@@ Y bed , what should come to pass her@@ e@@ after : and he that reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts mak@@ eth known to the@@ e what shall come to pass .
T@@ ho@@ u , O king , sa@@ west , and be@@ hold a great image . this great image , whose bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was excellent , stood before the@@ e ; and the form there@@ of was ter@@ ri@@ ble .
this image 's head was of fine gold , his bre@@ ast and his arms of silver , his bel@@ ly and his th@@ igh@@ s of br@@ ass ,
T@@ ho@@ u sa@@ west ti@@ ll that a stone was cut out without hands , which smo@@ te the image upon his feet that were of iron and cla@@ y , and br@@ ake them to pieces .
and wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the be@@ asts of the field and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en hat@@ h he given into th@@ ine hand , and hat@@ h made the@@ e ru@@ ler over them all . T@@ ho@@ u art this head of gold .
and the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom shall be strong as iron : for@@ as@@ much as iron break@@ eth in pieces and sub@@ du@@ eth all things : and as iron that break@@ eth all these , shall it break in pieces and bru@@ ise .
and whereas th@@ ou sa@@ west iron mixed with mir@@ y cla@@ y , they shall min@@ gle themselves with the se@@ ed of men : but they shall not cle@@ ave one to another , even as iron is not mixed with cla@@ y .
the king answ@@ ered un@@ to Daniel , and said , O@@ f a truth it is , that your God is a God of go@@ ds , and a Lord of kings , and a reve@@ al@@ er of secre@@ ts , seeing th@@ ou co@@ ul@@ dest reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel a great man , and gave him many great gifts , and made him ru@@ ler over the whole province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and chief of the govern@@ ors over all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king made an image of gold , whose he@@ ight was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of six cu@@ bi@@ ts : he set it up in the pla@@ in of D@@ ura , in the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king sent to gather together the pr@@ inces , the govern@@ ors , and the cap@@ tains , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the coun@@ sel@@ lers , the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ffs , and all the rul@@ ers of the provinces , to come to the dedic@@ ation of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cor@@ net , fl@@ ute , har@@ p , s@@ ack@@ but , p@@ sal@@ tery , dul@@ ci@@ mer , and all kinds of musi@@ ck , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king hat@@ h set up :
therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cor@@ net , fl@@ ute , har@@ p , s@@ ack@@ but , p@@ sal@@ tery , and all kinds of musi@@ ck , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and wor@@ shi@@ pped the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
but if not , be it known un@@ to the@@ e , O king , that we will not serve TH@@ Y go@@ ds , nor worship the golden image which th@@ ou h@@ ast set up .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar full of fur@@ y , and the form of his vis@@ age was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go : therefore he sp@@ ake , and comman@@ ded that they should heat the fur@@ n@@ ace one seven times more than it was won@@ t to be heated .
and he comman@@ ded the most m@@ igh@@ ty men that were in his army to bin@@ d Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , and to cast them into the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
then these men were bound in their co@@ ats , their hos@@ en , and their hat@@ s , and their other gar@@ ments , and were cast into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
and these three men , Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , fell down bound into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the th@@ ou@@ ghts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and be@@ hold a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th , and the he@@ ight there@@ of was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the he@@ ight there@@ of reached un@@ to heav@@ en , and the sight there@@ of to the end of all the ear@@ th :
the leaves there@@ of were fair , and the fruit there@@ of much , and in it was meat for all : the be@@ asts of the field had shadow under it , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en d@@ wel@@ t in the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of , and all f@@ les@@ h was f@@ ed of it .
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , be@@ hold , a wat@@ cher and an hol@@ y one came down from heav@@ en ;
he cri@@ ed al@@ oud , and said thus , H@@ ew down the tree , and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves , and sc@@ at@@ ter his fruit : let the be@@ asts get away from under it , and the fo@@ w@@ ls from his branches :
nevertheless leave the st@@ um@@ p of his roots in the ear@@ th , even with a band of iron and br@@ ass , in the tender gr@@ ass of the field ; and let it be w@@ et with the dew of heav@@ en , and let his portion be with the be@@ asts in the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th :
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let a be@@ ast 's heart be given un@@ to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that th@@ ou sa@@ west , which grew , and was strong , whose he@@ ight reached un@@ to the heav@@ en , and the sight there@@ of to all the ear@@ th ;
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit there@@ of much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the be@@ asts of the field d@@ wel@@ t , and upon whose branches the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en had their habi@@ tation :
it is th@@ ou , O king , that art grown and become strong : for TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness is grown , and reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to heav@@ en , and TH@@ Y domin@@ ion to the end of the ear@@ th .
and whereas they comman@@ ded to leave the st@@ um@@ p of the tree roots ; TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom shall be sure un@@ to the@@ e , after that th@@ ou s@@ halt have known that the heav@@ ens do rule .
the king sp@@ ake , and said , Is not this great Bab@@ yl@@ on , that I have built for the house of the k@@ ing@@ dom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my maj@@ es@@ ty ?
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from heav@@ en , saying , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to the@@ e it is spoken ; The k@@ ing@@ dom is depar@@ ted from the@@ e .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of the house of God which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king , and his pr@@ inces , his wi@@ ves , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank in them .
they d@@ rank wine , and praised the go@@ ds of gold , and of silver , of br@@ ass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the cand@@ le@@ stick upon the pla@@ ister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's coun@@ tenance was changed , and his th@@ ou@@ ghts troubled him , so that the join@@ ts of his lo@@ ins were lo@@ os@@ ed , and his k@@ ne@@ es smo@@ te one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . and the king sp@@ ake and said un@@ to Daniel , Art th@@ ou that Daniel , which art of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom the king my father brought out of Je@@ w@@ ry ?
I have even heard of the@@ e , that the spirit of the go@@ ds is in the@@ e , and that light and understanding and excellent wis@@ dom is found in the@@ e .
and now the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of : but they could not she@@ w the interpre@@ tation of the thing :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind har@@ dened in pride , he was de@@ posed from his k@@ ingly th@@ r@@ one , and they took his gl@@ ory from him :
Peres ; Th@@ y k@@ ing@@ dom is divided , and given to the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans .
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with scar@@ let , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made a proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and pr@@ inces , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole real@@ m .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans , which alter@@ eth not .
then answ@@ ered they and said before the king , That Daniel , which is of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , regar@@ de@@ th not the@@ e , O king , nor the decree that th@@ ou h@@ ast signed , but mak@@ eth his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he la@@ b@@ oured ti@@ ll the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then these men assemb@@ led un@@ to the king , and said un@@ to the king , K@@ now , O king , that the law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans is , That no decree nor statute which the king establis@@ het@@ h may be changed .
then the king comman@@ ded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of li@@ ons . now the king sp@@ ake and said un@@ to Daniel , Th@@ y God whom th@@ ou serv@@ est continu@@ ally , he will deliver the@@ e .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the m@@ outh of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lor@@ ds ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting : neither were instruments of musi@@ ck brought before him : and his sle@@ ep went from him .
then the king ar@@ ose very early in the morning , and went in has@@ te un@@ to the den of li@@ ons .
my God hat@@ h sent his an@@ gel , and hat@@ h shut the li@@ ons ' m@@ ou@@ ths , that they have not hurt me : for@@ as@@ much as before him inno@@ cen@@ cy was found in me ; and also before the@@ e , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and comman@@ ded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
I make a decree , That in every domin@@ ion of my k@@ ing@@ dom men tre@@ m@@ ble and fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , and ste@@ d@@ fast for ever , and his k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed , and his domin@@ ion shall be even un@@ to the end .
in the first year of Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
the first was like a lion , and had e@@ ag@@ le 's w@@ ings : I be@@ held ti@@ ll the w@@ ings there@@ of were p@@ lu@@ cked , and it was lifted up from the ear@@ th , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
after this I be@@ held , and lo another , like a Le@@ op@@ ard , which had upon the back of it four w@@ ings of a fo@@ w@@ l ; the be@@ ast had also four heads ; and domin@@ ion was given to it .
a fi@@ ery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands minist@@ ered un@@ to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I be@@ held then because of the voice of the great words which the Hor@@ n sp@@ ake : I be@@ held even ti@@ ll the be@@ ast was sla@@ in , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning fla@@ me .
I saw in the night visions , and , be@@ hold , one like the Son of man came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of heav@@ en , and came to the An@@ cient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and there was given him domin@@ ion , and gl@@ ory , and a k@@ ing@@ dom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his domin@@ ion is an ever@@ lasting domin@@ ion , which shall not pass away , and his k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed .
I came near un@@ to one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpre@@ tation of the things .
thus he said , The fourth be@@ ast shall be the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom upon ear@@ th , which shall be di@@ verse from all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , and shall dev@@ our the whole ear@@ th , and shall tre@@ ad it down , and break it in pieces .
and the ten hor@@ ns out of this k@@ ing@@ dom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be di@@ verse from the first , and he shall sub@@ due three kings .
in the third year of the reign of king Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar a vision appeared un@@ to me , even un@@ to me Daniel , after that which appeared un@@ to me at the first .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Sh@@ us@@ han in the palace , which is in the province of E@@ lam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , there stood before the river a ram which had two hor@@ ns : and the two hor@@ ns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and as I was considering , be@@ hold , an he go@@ at came from the west on the face of the whole ear@@ th , and touched not the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two hor@@ ns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran un@@ to him in the fur@@ y of his power .
and out of one of them came forth a little Hor@@ n , which wa@@ xed exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleas@@ ant land .
and it wa@@ xed great , even to the host of heav@@ en ; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground , and st@@ amp@@ ed upon them .
Ye@@ a , he mag@@ ni@@ fied himself even to the pr@@ ince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of trans@@ gres@@ sion , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practi@@ sed , and prosp@@ ered .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said un@@ to me , understand , O son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sle@@ ep on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me u@@ pri@@ ght .
and the roug@@ h go@@ at is the king of G@@ rec@@ ia : and the great Hor@@ n that is between his eyes is the first king .
and in the latter time of their k@@ ing@@ dom , when the trans@@ gres@@ sors are come to the full , a king of fierce coun@@ tenance , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
and his power shall be m@@ igh@@ ty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy won@@ der@@ fully , and shall prosp@@ er , and practi@@ se , and shall destroy the m@@ igh@@ ty and the hol@@ y people .
and I Daniel fa@@ in@@ ted , and was si@@ ck certain days ; after@@ ward I rose up , and did the king 's business ; and I was ast@@ on@@ ished at the vision , but none understood it .
we have sin@@ ned , and have committed in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly , and have rebel@@ led , even by depar@@ ting from TH@@ Y prec@@ ep@@ ts and from TH@@ Y judg@@ ments :
neither have we hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , which sp@@ ake in TH@@ Y name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
as it is written in the law of Mos@@ es , all this ev@@ il is come upon us : yet made we not our pray@@ er before the Lord our God , that we might turn from our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and understand TH@@ Y truth .
therefore hat@@ h the Lord watched upon the ev@@ il , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he do@@ eth : for we obe@@ yed not his voice .
and now , O Lord our God , that h@@ ast brought TH@@ Y people forth out of the land of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and h@@ ast gotten the@@ e ren@@ own , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
now therefore , O our God , hear the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and his supp@@ lic@@ ations , and cause TH@@ Y face to sh@@ ine upon TH@@ Y sanc@@ tu@@ ary that is de@@ so@@ late , for the Lord 's sake .
O my God , inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar , and hear ; open th@@ ine eyes , and be@@ hold our de@@ so@@ lations , and the city which is called by TH@@ Y name : for we do not present our supp@@ lic@@ ations before the@@ e for our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses , but for TH@@ Y great mer@@ cies .
and wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking , and pray@@ ing , and conf@@ essing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord my God for the hol@@ y mountain of my God ;
Ye@@ a , wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking in pray@@ er , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening ob@@ lation .
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give the@@ e sk@@ ill and understanding .
and in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is H@@ idde@@ kel ;
then I lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold a certain man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , whose lo@@ ins were gir@@ ded with fine gold of U@@ p@@ haz :
and I Daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with me saw not the vision ; but a great qu@@ ak@@ ing fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sle@@ ep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
and when he had spoken such words un@@ to me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dum@@ b .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there bre@@ ath left in me .
then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me ,
then said he , K@@ now@@ est th@@ ou where@@ fore I come un@@ to the@@ e ? and now will I return to fight with the pr@@ ince of Per@@ sia : and when I am gone forth , lo , the pr@@ ince of G@@ rec@@ ia shall come .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate , which shall come with an army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prev@@ ail :
and shall also carry cap@@ tives into Egypt their go@@ ds , with their pr@@ inces , and with their pre@@ ci@@ ous vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
and the king of the south shall be moved with cho@@ ler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multi@@ tude ; but the multi@@ tude shall be given into his hand .
and when he hat@@ h taken away the multi@@ tude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
for the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multi@@ tude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much ri@@ ches .
but he that co@@ me@@ th against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him : and he shall stand in the g@@ lor@@ ious land , which by his hand shall be consu@@ med .
after this shall he turn his face un@@ to the is@@ les , and shall take many : but a pr@@ ince for his own behalf shall cause the re@@ pro@@ ach offered by him to ce@@ ase ; without his own re@@ pro@@ ach he shall cause it to turn upon him .
and in his estate shall stand up a v@@ ile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in peac@@ e@@ ably , and obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be over@@ flo@@ wn from before him , and shall be broken ; ye@@ a , also the pr@@ ince of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and after the league made with him he shall work dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
Ye@@ a , they that fe@@ ed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall over@@ flow : and many shall fall down sla@@ in .
then shall he return into his land with great ri@@ ches ; and his heart shall be against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and he shall do explo@@ its , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
for the ships of Ch@@ it@@ tim shall come against him : therefore he shall be gri@@ ev@@ ed , and return , and have in@@ dign@@ ation against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with them that for@@ sake the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and arms shall stand on his part , and they shall poll@@ ute the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the ab@@ omin@@ ation that mak@@ eth de@@ so@@ late .
and such as do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly against the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall he corrupt by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do explo@@ its .
neither shall he regard the God of his fa@@ thers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any go@@ d : for he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself above all .
but in his estate shall he honour the God of forces : and a go@@ d whom his fa@@ thers knew not shall he honour with gold , and silver , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and pleas@@ ant things .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many countries shall be over@@ thrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt : and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
but ti@@ dings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fur@@ y to destroy , and ut@@ ter@@ ly to make away many .
and many of them that sle@@ ep in the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th shall aw@@ ake , some to ever@@ lasting life , and some to sh@@ ame and ever@@ lasting con@@ temp@@ t .
and they that be wise shall sh@@ ine as the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the fir@@ mam@@ ent ; and they that turn many to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as the stars for ever and ever .
but th@@ ou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and se@@ al the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and f@@ ro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , be@@ hold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
many shall be pur@@ ified , and made white , and tried ; but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly : and none of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that mak@@ eth de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days .
b@@ les@@ sed is he that w@@ ai@@ te@@ th , and co@@ me@@ th to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
the word of the Lord that came un@@ to Hos@@ ea , the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the days of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
and the Lord said un@@ to him , C@@ all his name J@@ ez@@ reel ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ en@@ ge the blood of J@@ ez@@ reel upon the house of J@@ eh@@ u , and will cause to ce@@ ase the k@@ ing@@ dom of the house of Israel .
but I will have mer@@ cy upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bo@@ w , nor by s@@ word , nor by battle , by hor@@ ses , nor by hor@@ se@@ men .
yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can@@ not be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are not my people , there it shall be said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are the sons of the living God .
then shall the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of J@@ ez@@ reel .
p@@ lead with your mother , p@@ lead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her who@@ red@@ oms out of her sight , and her ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies from between her bre@@ asts ;
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and s@@ lay her with thir@@ st .
therefore will I return , and take away my cor@@ n in the time there@@ of , and my wine in the season there@@ of , and will rec@@ over my wo@@ ol and my fla@@ x given to cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and now will I discover her le@@ w@@ d@@ ness in the sight of her lov@@ ers , and none shall deliver her out of mine hand .
and I will destroy her v@@ ines and her fi@@ g trees , where@@ of she hat@@ h said , These are my re@@ wards that my lov@@ ers have given me : and I will make them a forest , and the be@@ asts of the field shall eat them .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ al@@ im , where@@ in she burned incen@@ se to them , and she dec@@ ked her@@ self with her ear@@ r@@ ings and her je@@ wel@@ s , and she went after her lov@@ ers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and I will give her her v@@ ine@@ yards from th@@ ence , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for I will take away the names of Ba@@ al@@ im out of her m@@ outh , and they shall no more be remember@@ ed by their name .
and I will bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me for ever ; ye@@ a , I will bet@@ ro@@ th the@@ e un@@ to me in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and in judgment , and in lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , and in mer@@ cies .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a pr@@ ince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ep@@ ho@@ d , and without ter@@ ap@@ him :
hear the word of the Lord , ye children of Israel : for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mer@@ cy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore shall the land mour@@ n , and every one that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th there@@ in shall langu@@ ish , with the be@@ asts of the field , and with the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en ; ye@@ a , the fis@@ hes of the sea also shall be taken away .
therefore s@@ halt th@@ ou fall in the day , and the pro@@ phe@@ t also shall fall with the@@ e in the night , and I will destroy TH@@ Y mother .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask coun@@ sel at their sto@@ cks , and their staff declar@@ eth un@@ to them : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms hat@@ h caused them to er@@ r , and they have gone a wh@@ oring from under their God .
I will not punish your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters when they commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , nor your sp@@ ous@@ es when they commit ad@@ ul@@ tery : for themselves are separated with who@@ res , and they sacrifice with har@@ lots : therefore the people that do@@ th not understand shall fall .
the wind hat@@ h bound her up in her w@@ ings , and they shall be as@@ ha@@ med because of their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
they will not frame their do@@ ings to turn un@@ to their God : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms is in the mid@@ st of them , and they have not known the Lord .
and the pride of Israel do@@ th testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im fall in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; Ju@@ da@@ h also shall fall with them .
they shall go with their f@@ loc@@ ks and with their her@@ ds to seek the Lord ; but they shall not find him ; he hat@@ h withdrawn himself from them .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be de@@ so@@ late in the day of re@@ bu@@ ke : among the tri@@ bes of Israel have I made known that which shall su@@ rely be .
when E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im saw his si@@ ck@@ ness , and Ju@@ da@@ h saw his wo@@ und , then went E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , and sent to king J@@ are@@ b : yet could he not he@@ al you , nor c@@ ure you of your wo@@ und .
for I will be un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come un@@ to us as the rain , as the latter and former rain un@@ to the ear@@ th .
therefore have I he@@ wed them by the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; I have sla@@ in them by the words of my m@@ outh : and TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are as the light that go@@ eth forth .
when I would have he@@ aled Israel , then the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was discovered , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Samar@@ ia : for they commit fal@@ se@@ hood ; and the th@@ i@@ ef co@@ me@@ th in , and the troop of rob@@ bers sp@@ o@@ il@@ eth without .
and they consider not in their hear@@ ts that I remember all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : now their own do@@ ings have bes@@ et them about ; they are before my face .
they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , as an ov@@ en heated by the Bak@@ er , who ce@@ as@@ eth from raising after he hat@@ h k@@ needed the d@@ ough , until it be le@@ av@@ ened .
for they have made ready their heart like an ov@@ en , wh@@ il@@ es they lie in wait : their Bak@@ er sle@@ ep@@ eth all the night ; in the morning it bur@@ net@@ h as a f@@ laming fire .
they are all hot as an ov@@ en , and have dev@@ oured their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that cal@@ le@@ th un@@ to me .
S@@ tran@@ gers have dev@@ oured his strength , and he know@@ eth it not : ye@@ a , gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s are here and there upon him , yet he know@@ eth not .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en ; I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their Con@@ gre@@ gation hat@@ h heard .
and they have not cri@@ ed un@@ to me with their heart , when they ho@@ w@@ led upon their beds : they assem@@ ble themselves for cor@@ n and wine , and they rebel against me .
set the tr@@ ump@@ et to TH@@ Y m@@ outh . he shall come as an e@@ ag@@ le against the house of the Lord , because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and t@@ res@@ passed against my law .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made pr@@ inces , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them id@@ ols , that they may be cut off .
TH@@ Y cal@@ f , O Samar@@ ia , hat@@ h cast the@@ e off ; mine an@@ ger is kin@@ d@@ led against them : how long will it be ER@@ E they at@@ tain to inno@@ cen@@ cy ?
for they have so@@ wn the wind , and they shall re@@ ap the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it hat@@ h no stal@@ k : the bu@@ d shall yield no me@@ al : if so be it yield , the st@@ ran@@ gers shall sw@@ allow it up .
Ye@@ a , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sor@@ row a little for the burden of the king of pr@@ inces .
they shall not d@@ well in the Lord 's land ; but E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat un@@ clean things in As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Mem@@ p@@ his shall bur@@ y them : the pleas@@ ant places for their silver , net@@ t@@ les shall poss@@ ess them : thor@@ ns shall be in their tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
the watch@@ man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was with my God : but the pro@@ phe@@ t is a sn@@ are of a fo@@ w@@ ler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
they have deeply cor@@ rupted themselves , as in the days of Gi@@ be@@ ah : therefore he will remember their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , he will visit their sin@@ s .
though they bring up their children , yet will I ber@@ e@@ ave them , that there shall not be a man left : ye@@ a , wo@@ e also to them when I de@@ part from them !
all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in G@@ ilg@@ al : for there I ha@@ ted them : for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their do@@ ings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their pr@@ inces are revol@@ ters .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is s@@ mit@@ ten , their root is dri@@ ed up , they shall bear no fruit : ye@@ a , though they bring forth , yet will I s@@ lay even the bel@@ ov@@ ed fruit of their w@@ om@@ b .
Israel is an empty v@@ ine , he br@@ ing@@ eth forth fruit un@@ to himself : according to the multi@@ tude of his fruit he hat@@ h increased the al@@ tar@@ s ; according to the Go@@ od@@ ness of his land they have made good@@ ly images .
it shall be also carried un@@ to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a for a present to king J@@ are@@ b : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall receive sh@@ ame , and Israel shall be as@@ ha@@ med of his own coun@@ sel .
it is in my desire that I should ch@@ as@@ tise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bin@@ d themselves in their two fur@@ ro@@ ws .
and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is as an he@@ if@@ er that is ta@@ ught , and lov@@ eth to tre@@ ad out the cor@@ n ; but I passed over upon her fair nec@@ k : I will make E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to ride ; Ju@@ da@@ h shall plo@@ w , and Jac@@ o@@ b shall break his clo@@ ds .
Y@@ e have p@@ low@@ ed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , ye have re@@ ap@@ ed in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; ye have e@@ aten the fruit of lies : because th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st trust in TH@@ Y way , in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty men .
therefore shall a t@@ um@@ ult arise among TH@@ Y people , and all TH@@ Y for@@ t@@ resses shall be sp@@ o@@ iled , as S@@ hal@@ man sp@@ o@@ iled Beth @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ bel in the day of battle : the mother was d@@ ashed in pieces upon her children .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yok@@ e on their j@@ a@@ ws , and I laid meat un@@ to them .
I will not exec@@ ute the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of mine an@@ ger , I will not return to destroy E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : and I will not enter into the city .
they shall walk after the Lord : he shall ro@@ ar like a lion : when he shall ro@@ ar , then the children shall tre@@ m@@ ble from the west .
they shall tre@@ m@@ ble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and I will place them in their houses , sa@@ ith the Lord .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im fe@@ ede@@ th on wind , and follow@@ eth after the east wind : he daily increas@@ eth lies and de@@ so@@ lation ; and they do make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , and oil is carried into Egypt .
the Lord hat@@ h also a controversy with Ju@@ da@@ h , and will punish Jac@@ o@@ b according to his ways ; according to his do@@ ings will he re@@ compen@@ se him .
and I that am the Lord TH@@ Y God from the land of Egypt will yet make the@@ e to d@@ well in tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les , as in the days of the so@@ lem@@ n feast .
therefore they shall be as the morning cl@@ oud , and as the early dew that pass@@ eth away , as the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
according to their pas@@ ture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was ex@@ al@@ ted ; therefore have they forgotten me .
I will meet them as a bear that is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of her whel@@ ps , and will ren@@ d the ca@@ ul of their heart , and there will I dev@@ our them like a lion : the wild be@@ ast shall tear them .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman shall come upon him : he is an un@@ wise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
though he be fruit@@ ful among his bre@@ th@@ ren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the Lord shall come up from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and his spring shall become d@@ ry , and his fo@@ un@@ tain shall be dri@@ ed up : he shall sp@@ oil the treasure of all pleas@@ ant vessels .
Samar@@ ia shall become de@@ so@@ late ; for she hat@@ h rebel@@ led against her God : they shall fall by the s@@ word : their inf@@ ants shall be d@@ ashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ri@@ pped up .
As@@ sh@@ ur shall not save us ; we will not ride upon hor@@ ses : neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , Y@@ e are our go@@ ds : for in the@@ e the fa@@ ther@@ less fin@@ de@@ th mer@@ cy .
they that d@@ well under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the cor@@ n , and grow as the v@@ ine : the s@@ cent there@@ of shall be as the wine of Lebanon .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall say , What have I to do any more with id@@ ols ? I have heard him , and observed him : I am like a green f@@ ir tree . from me is TH@@ Y fruit found .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? pru@@ dent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall fall there@@ in .
that which the pal@@ mer@@ wor@@ m hat@@ h left hat@@ h the loc@@ ust e@@ aten ; and that which the loc@@ ust hat@@ h left hat@@ h the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m e@@ aten ; and that which the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m hat@@ h left hat@@ h the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler e@@ aten .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose te@@ eth are the te@@ eth of a lion , and he hat@@ h the che@@ ek te@@ eth of a great lion .
he hat@@ h laid my v@@ ine waste , and bar@@ ked my fi@@ g tree : he hat@@ h made it clean b@@ are , and cast it away ; the branches there@@ of are made white .
the v@@ ine is dri@@ ed up , and the fi@@ g tree langu@@ is@@ het@@ h ; the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree , the pal@@ m tree also , and the app@@ le tree , even all the trees of the field , are with@@ ered : because joy is with@@ ered away from the sons of men .
San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy ye a fast , call a so@@ lem@@ n assembly , gather the el@@ ders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God , and cry un@@ to the Lord ,
how do the be@@ asts gro@@ an ! the her@@ ds of c@@ attle are per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed , because they have no pas@@ ture ; ye@@ a , the f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep are made de@@ so@@ late .
O Lord , to the@@ e will I cry : for the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the fla@@ me hat@@ h burned all the trees of the field .
the be@@ asts of the field cry also un@@ to the@@ e : for the rivers of waters are dri@@ ed up , and the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
blow ye the tr@@ ump@@ et in Z@@ ion , and sound an alarm in my hol@@ y mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land tre@@ m@@ ble : for the day of the Lord co@@ me@@ th , for it is n@@ igh at hand ;
a fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th before them ; and behind them a fla@@ me bur@@ net@@ h : the land is as the gar@@ den of E@@ den before them , and behind them a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; ye@@ a , and nothing shall escape them .
the appearance of them is as the appearance of hor@@ ses ; and as hor@@ se@@ men , so shall they run .
like the no@@ ise of char@@ i@@ ots on the tops of mountains shall they le@@ ap , like the no@@ ise of a fla@@ me of fire that dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th the st@@ ub@@ ble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they shall run like m@@ igh@@ ty men ; they shall clim@@ b the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
neither shall one th@@ rust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the s@@ word , they shall not be wounded .
they shall run to and f@@ ro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall clim@@ b up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a th@@ i@@ ef .
the ear@@ th shall quake before them ; the heav@@ ens shall tre@@ m@@ ble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their sh@@ ining :
and the Lord shall ut@@ ter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that execu@@ te@@ th his word : for the day of the Lord is great and very ter@@ ri@@ ble ; and who can abide it ?
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your gar@@ ments , and turn un@@ to the Lord your God : for he is gr@@ ac@@ ious and mer@@ ci@@ ful , slow to an@@ ger , and of great kin@@ d@@ ness , and re@@ pen@@ te@@ th him of the ev@@ il .
gather the people , sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Con@@ gre@@ gation , assem@@ ble the el@@ ders , gather the children , and those that su@@ ck the bre@@ asts : let the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om go forth of his chamber , and the bri@@ de out of her clos@@ et .
Ye@@ a , the Lord will answer and say un@@ to his people , be@@ hold , I will send you cor@@ n , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied there@@ with : and I will no more make you a re@@ pro@@ ach among the he@@ a@@ then :
be not afraid , ye be@@ asts of the field : for the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness do spring , for the tree be@@ aret@@ h her fruit , the fi@@ g tree and the v@@ ine do yield their strength .
and I will restore to you the years that the loc@@ ust hat@@ h e@@ aten , the can@@ ker@@ wor@@ m , and the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ ler , and the pal@@ mer@@ wor@@ m , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hat@@ h dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you : and my people shall never be as@@ ha@@ med .
and ye shall know that I am in the mid@@ st of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God , and none else : and my people shall never be as@@ ha@@ med .
and it shall come to pass after@@ ward , that I will p@@ our out my spirit upon all f@@ les@@ h ; and your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , your old men shall dream dre@@ ams , your young men shall see visions :
the sun shall be turned into d@@ ark@@ ness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the ter@@ ri@@ ble day of the Lord come .
for , be@@ hold , in those days , and in that time , when I shall bring again the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem ,
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and will p@@ lead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have sc@@ at@@ tered among the nations , and par@@ ted my land .
and they have cast lots for my people ; and have given a boy for an har@@ lot , and sold a girl for wine , that they might drink .
Ye@@ a , and what have ye to do with me , O T@@ y@@ re , and Z@@ id@@ on , and all the co@@ asts of Palest@@ ine ? will ye ren@@ der me a re@@ comp@@ ence ? and if ye re@@ comp@@ ence me , swi@@ f@@ tly and spe@@ edil@@ y will I return your re@@ comp@@ ence upon your own head ;
because ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temp@@ les my good@@ ly pleas@@ ant things :
the children also of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem have ye sold un@@ to the Gre@@ cians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hand of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall sell them to the Sab@@ e@@ ans , to a people far off : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , and come , all ye he@@ a@@ then , and gather yo@@ ur@@ selves together round about : th@@ ither cause TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty ones to come down , O Lord .
let the he@@ a@@ then be w@@ ak@@ ened , and come up to the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at : for there will I sit to judge all the he@@ a@@ then round about .
the Lord also shall ro@@ ar out of Z@@ ion , and ut@@ ter his voice from Jer@@ usalem ; and the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th shall shake : but the Lord will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hil@@ ls shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of Ju@@ da@@ h shall flow with waters , and a fo@@ un@@ tain shall come forth of the house of the Lord , and shall water the val@@ ley of Sh@@ it@@ tim .
Egypt shall be a de@@ so@@ lation , and E@@ dom shall be a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , for the violence against the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
and he said , The Lord will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and ut@@ ter his voice from Jer@@ usalem ; and the habi@@ tations of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds shall mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ mel shall wi@@ ther .
I will break also the bar of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and cut off the inhabi@@ tant from the pla@@ in of Av@@ en , and him that hol@@ de@@ th the scep@@ tre from the house of E@@ den : and the people of Syria shall go into cap@@ tivity un@@ to K@@ ir , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they carried away cap@@ tive the whole cap@@ tivity , to deliver them up to E@@ dom :
and I will cut off the inhabi@@ tant from Ash@@ do@@ d , and him that hol@@ de@@ th the scep@@ tre from Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and I will turn mine hand against E@@ kr@@ on : and the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines shall per@@ ish , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they delivered up the whole cap@@ tivity to E@@ dom , and remember@@ ed not the bro@@ ther@@ ly C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of the children of Am@@ mon , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they have ri@@ pped up the women with child of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that they might en@@ large their border :
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces there@@ of , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a temp@@ est in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Mo@@ a@@ b , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because he burned the b@@ ones of the king of E@@ dom into li@@ me :
but I will send a fire upon Mo@@ a@@ b , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces of Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th : and Mo@@ a@@ b shall die with t@@ um@@ ult , with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ju@@ da@@ h , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they have desp@@ ised the law of the Lord , and have not kept his comman@@ d@@ ments , and their lies caused them to er@@ r , after the which their fa@@ thers have walked :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they sold the righ@@ te@@ ous for silver , and the poor for a pair of sho@@ es ;
that p@@ ant after the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the me@@ ek : and a man and his father will go in un@@ to the same ma@@ id , to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name :
and they lay themselves down upon clo@@ th@@ es laid to pledge by every alt@@ ar , and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their go@@ d .
yet destroyed I the Am@@ or@@ ite before them , whose he@@ ight was like the he@@ ight of the c@@ ed@@ ars , and he was strong as the o@@ aks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from ben@@ e@@ ath .
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you for@@ ty years through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , to poss@@ ess the land of the Am@@ or@@ ite .
and I raised up of your sons for pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of your young men for N@@ azar@@ ites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore the flight shall per@@ ish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the m@@ igh@@ ty deliver himself :
neither shall he stand that hand@@ le@@ th the bo@@ w ; and he that is swift of fo@@ ot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that ri@@ de@@ th the hor@@ se deliver himself .
hear this word that the Lord hat@@ h spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
will a lion ro@@ ar in the forest , when he hat@@ h no pre@@ y ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
can a bird fall in a sn@@ are upon the ear@@ th , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a sn@@ are from the ear@@ th , and have taken nothing at all ?
shall a tr@@ ump@@ et be blo@@ wn in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be ev@@ il in a city , and the Lord hat@@ h not done it ?
publish in the pal@@ aces at Ash@@ do@@ d , and in the pal@@ aces in the land of Egypt , and say , assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves upon the mountains of Samar@@ ia , and be@@ hold the great t@@ um@@ ults in the mid@@ st there@@ of , and the op@@ pressed in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; A@@ n ad@@ versary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down TH@@ Y strength from the@@ e , and TH@@ Y pal@@ aces shall be sp@@ o@@ iled .
that in the day that I shall visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel upon him I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l : and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and also I have with@@ hol@@ den the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the har@@ v@@ est : and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was ra@@ ined upon , and the piece where@@ upon it ra@@ ined not with@@ ered .
I have s@@ mit@@ ten you with b@@ lasting and mil@@ dew : when your gar@@ den@@ s and your v@@ ine@@ yards and your fi@@ g trees and your olive trees increased , the pal@@ mer@@ wor@@ m dev@@ oured them : yet have ye not returned un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
seek the Lord , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and dev@@ our it , and there be none to qu@@ en@@ ch it in Be@@ the@@ l .
For@@ as@@ much therefore as your t@@ reading is upon the poor , and ye take from him bur@@ den@@ s of wheat : ye have built houses of he@@ wn stone , but ye shall not d@@ well in them ; ye have plan@@ ted pleas@@ ant v@@ ine@@ yards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
for I know your manif@@ old trans@@ gres@@ sions and your m@@ igh@@ ty sin@@ s : they aff@@ lic@@ t the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
seek good , and not ev@@ il , that ye may live : and so the Lord , the God of hosts , shall be with you , as ye have spoken .
as if a man did flee from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house , and le@@ an@@ ed his hand on the wall , and a ser@@ p@@ ent bit him .
though ye offer me bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and your meat offer@@ ings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offer@@ ings of your f@@ at be@@ asts .
take th@@ ou away from me the no@@ ise of TH@@ Y songs ; for I will not hear the me@@ lo@@ dy of TH@@ Y viol@@ s .
Wo@@ e to them that are at ease in Z@@ ion , and trust in the mountain of Samar@@ ia , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel came !
pass ye un@@ to Cal@@ ne@@ h , and see ; and from th@@ ence go ye to Ham@@ ath the great : then go down to G@@ ath of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : be they better than these k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ? or their border greater than your border ?
that lie upon beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves upon their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
that drink wine in bo@@ w@@ ls , and ano@@ int themselves with the chief o@@ in@@ tments : but they are not gri@@ ev@@ ed for the aff@@ li@@ ction of Joseph .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord comman@@ de@@ th , and he will sm@@ ite the great house with breaches , and the little house with cle@@ fts .
thus hat@@ h the Lord God she@@ wed un@@ to me ; and , be@@ hold , he formed gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mo@@ w@@ ings .
and the high places of I@@ sa@@ ac shall be de@@ so@@ late , and the sanc@@ tu@@ aries of Israel shall be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am with the s@@ word .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est of Be@@ the@@ l sent to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am king of Israel , saying , Am@@ os hat@@ h consp@@ ired against the@@ e in the mid@@ st of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
shall not the land tre@@ m@@ ble for this , and every one mour@@ n that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th there@@ in ? and it shall rise up wh@@ ol@@ ly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and dro@@ w@@ ned , as by the flood of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will dar@@ ken the ear@@ th in the clear day :
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that I will send a fam@@ ine in the land , not a fam@@ ine of bread , nor a thir@@ st for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord :
and they shall w@@ ander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and f@@ ro to seek the word of the Lord , and shall not find it .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ mel , I will search and take them out th@@ ence ; and though they be hi@@ d from my sight in the bottom of the sea , th@@ ence will I command the ser@@ p@@ ent , and he shall bi@@ te them :
and though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enem@@ ies , th@@ ence will I command the s@@ word , and it shall s@@ lay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for ev@@ il , and not for good .
it is he that buil@@ de@@ th his stories in the heav@@ en , and hat@@ h founded his troop in the ear@@ th ; he that cal@@ le@@ th for the waters of the sea , and p@@ ou@@ re@@ th them out upon the face of the ear@@ th : the Lord is his name .
are ye not as children of the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians un@@ to me , O children of Israel ? sa@@ ith the Lord . have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt ? and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines from Cap@@ h@@ tor , and the Syri@@ ans from K@@ ir ?
be@@ hold , the eyes of the Lord God are upon the s@@ inf@@ ul k@@ ing@@ dom , and I will destroy it from off the face of the ear@@ th ; saving that I will not ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as cor@@ n is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least gra@@ in fall upon the ear@@ th .
in that day will I raise up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches there@@ of ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and drink the wine there@@ of ; they shall also make gar@@ den@@ s , and eat the fruit of them .
and I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them , sa@@ ith the Lord TH@@ Y God .
the pride of th@@ ine heart hat@@ h dec@@ e@@ ived the@@ e , th@@ ou that d@@ wel@@ lest in the cle@@ fts of the rock , whose habi@@ tation is high ; that sa@@ ith in his heart , Wh@@ o shall bring me down to the ground ?
though th@@ ou ex@@ alt th@@ y@@ self as the e@@ ag@@ le , and though th@@ ou set TH@@ Y n@@ est among the stars , th@@ ence will I bring the@@ e down , sa@@ ith the Lord .
but th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not have looked on the day of TH@@ Y brother in the day that he became a st@@ ran@@ ger ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have spoken pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .
T@@ ho@@ u sho@@ ul@@ dest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not have looked on their aff@@ li@@ ction in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity , nor have laid hands on their sub@@ stance in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity ;
neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have stood in the cross@@ way , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of dist@@ ress .
for as ye have dr@@ un@@ k upon my hol@@ y mountain , so shall all the he@@ a@@ then drink continu@@ ally , ye@@ a , they shall drink , and they shall sw@@ allow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and the house of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a fla@@ me , and the house of E@@ sa@@ u for st@@ ub@@ ble , and they shall kin@@ dle in them , and dev@@ our them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of E@@ sa@@ u ; for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a m@@ igh@@ ty temp@@ est in the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
then said they un@@ to him , What shall we do un@@ to the@@ e , that the sea may be calm un@@ to us ? for the sea w@@ rought , and was temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous .
nevertheless the men ro@@ wed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea w@@ rought , and was temp@@ es@@ tu@@ ous against them .
so they took up Jon@@ ah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ce@@ ased from her ra@@ ging .
and said , I cri@@ ed by reason of mine aff@@ li@@ ction un@@ to the Lord , and he heard me ; out of the bel@@ ly of hell cri@@ ed I , and th@@ ou hear@@ dest my voice .
for th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st cast me into the deep , in the mid@@ st of the seas ; and the floods comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : all TH@@ Y bil@@ lows and TH@@ Y waves passed over me .
the waters comp@@ ass@@ ed me about , even to the sou@@ l : the dep@@ th closed me round about , the we@@ eds were wrapped about my head .
I went down to the bott@@ oms of the mountains ; the ear@@ th with her bars was about me for ever : yet h@@ ast th@@ ou brought up my life from corruption , O Lord my God .
so the people of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
for word came un@@ to the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and he laid his ro@@ be from him , and covered him with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but let man and be@@ ast be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly un@@ to God : ye@@ a , let them turn every one from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their ev@@ il way ; and God re@@ pen@@ ted of the ev@@ il , that he had said that he would do un@@ to them ; and he did it not .
therefore now , O Lord , take , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
so Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the shadow , ti@@ ll he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a go@@ ur@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his gri@@ ef . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the go@@ ur@@ d .
the word of the Lord that came to Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ as@@ th@@ ite in the days of Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which he saw concerning Samar@@ ia and Jer@@ usalem .
for , be@@ hold , the Lord co@@ me@@ th forth out of his place , and will come down , and tre@@ ad upon the high places of the ear@@ th .
and the mountains shall be m@@ ol@@ ten under him , and the val@@ ley@@ s shall be cle@@ ft , as wa@@ x before the fire , and as the waters that are p@@ oured down a steep place .
for the trans@@ gres@@ sion of Jac@@ o@@ b is all this , and for the sin@@ s of the house of Israel . what is the trans@@ gres@@ sion of Jac@@ o@@ b ? is it not Samar@@ ia ? and what are the high places of Ju@@ da@@ h ? are they not Jer@@ usalem ?
therefore I will make Samar@@ ia as an he@@ ap of the field , and as plan@@ t@@ ings of a v@@ ine@@ yard : and I will p@@ our down the stones there@@ of into the val@@ ley , and I will discover the foundations there@@ of .
declare ye it not at G@@ ath , we@@ ep ye not at all : in the house of A@@ ph@@ ra@@ h rol@@ l th@@ y@@ self in the d@@ ust .
pass ye away , th@@ ou inhabi@@ tant of Sap@@ hir , having TH@@ Y sh@@ ame nak@@ ed : the inhabi@@ tant of Za@@ anan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ el ; he shall receive of you his standing .
O th@@ ou inhabi@@ tant of L@@ ach@@ ish , bin@@ d the char@@ i@@ ot to the swift be@@ ast : she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Z@@ ion : for the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel were found in the@@ e .
Wo@@ e to them that dev@@ ise in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and work ev@@ il upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practi@@ se it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they c@@ ov@@ et fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
even of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye pull off the ro@@ be with the gar@@ ment from them that pass by sec@@ u@@ rely as men aver@@ se from war .
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleas@@ ant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my gl@@ ory for ever .
the bre@@ aker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
and I said , He@@ ar , I pra@@ y you , O heads of Jac@@ o@@ b , and ye pr@@ inces of the house of Israel ; Is it not for you to know judgment ?
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them ; and they break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry un@@ to the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have beha@@ ved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets that make my people er@@ r , that bi@@ te with their te@@ eth , and cry , Peace ; and he that p@@ ut@@ te@@ th not into their m@@ ou@@ ths , they even prepare war against him .
therefore night shall be un@@ to you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark un@@ to you , that ye shall not div@@ ine ; and the sun shall go down over the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day shall be dark over them .
then shall the se@@ ers be as@@ ha@@ med , and the di@@ vin@@ ers con@@ founded : ye@@ a , they shall all cover their li@@ ps ; for there is no answer of God .
but truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord , and of judgment , and of might , to declare un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b his trans@@ gres@@ sion , and to Israel his sin .
hear this , I pra@@ y you , ye heads of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and pr@@ inces of the house of Israel , that ab@@ h@@ or judgment , and per@@ ver@@ t all equ@@ ity .
therefore shall Z@@ ion for your sake be p@@ low@@ ed as a field , and Jer@@ usalem shall become he@@ aps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
but in the last days it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains , and it shall be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and people shall flow un@@ to it .
and he shall judge among many people , and re@@ bu@@ ke strong nations af@@ ar off ; and they shall beat their s@@ words into p@@ low@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ ing@@ ho@@ oks : nation shall not lift up a s@@ word against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
but they shall sit every man under his v@@ ine and under his fi@@ g tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the m@@ outh of the Lord of hosts hat@@ h spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his go@@ d , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , will I assem@@ ble her that hal@@ te@@ th , and I will gather her that is driven out , and her that I have aff@@ lic@@ ted ;
and I will make her that halted a re@@ mn@@ ant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation : and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Z@@ ion from hen@@ ce@@ forth , even for ever .
and th@@ ou , O to@@ wer of the flock , the strong hold of the daughter of Z@@ ion , un@@ to the@@ e shall it come , even the first domin@@ ion ; the k@@ ing@@ dom shall come to the daughter of Jer@@ usalem .
now gather th@@ y@@ self in troops , O daughter of troops : he hat@@ h laid siege against us : they shall sm@@ ite the judge of Israel with a ro@@ d upon the che@@ ek .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which trav@@ ail@@ eth hat@@ h brought forth : then the re@@ mn@@ ant of his bre@@ th@@ ren shall return un@@ to the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and fe@@ ed in the strength of the Lord , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into our land : and when he shall tre@@ ad in our pal@@ aces , then shall we raise against him seven she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and eight principal men .
and they shall waste the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a with the s@@ word , and the land of N@@ im@@ ro@@ d in the en@@ tran@@ ces there@@ of : thus shall he deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , when he co@@ me@@ th into our land , and when he tre@@ ade@@ th within our borders .
and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be in the mid@@ st of many people as a dew from the Lord , as the sho@@ wers upon the gr@@ ass , that tar@@ ri@@ eth not for man , nor w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the sons of men .
and it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will cut off TH@@ Y hor@@ ses out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and I will destroy TH@@ Y char@@ i@@ ots :
TH@@ Y Gra@@ ven images also will I cut off , and TH@@ Y standing images out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more worship the work of th@@ ine hands .
hear ye , O mountains , the Lord 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with his people , and he will p@@ lead with Israel .
for I brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt , and re@@ deemed the@@ e out of the house of servants ; and I sent before the@@ e Mos@@ es , Aaron , and Mi@@ ri@@ am .
will the Lord be pleased with thousands of r@@ ams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my fir@@ st@@ born for my trans@@ gres@@ sion , the fruit of my body for the sin of my sou@@ l ?
for the rich men there@@ of are full of violence , and the inhabitants there@@ of have spoken lies , and their ton@@ gue is dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful in their m@@ outh .
therefore also will I make the@@ e si@@ ck in s@@ mit@@ ing the@@ e , in making the@@ e de@@ so@@ late because of TH@@ Y sin@@ s .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat , but not be satisfied ; and TH@@ Y casting down shall be in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt take hold , but s@@ halt not deliver ; and that which th@@ ou deliver@@ est will I give up to the s@@ word .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt so@@ w , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not re@@ ap ; th@@ ou s@@ halt tre@@ ad the ol@@ ives , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not ano@@ int the@@ e with oil ; and swe@@ et wine , but s@@ halt not drink wine .
the good man is per@@ ished out of the ear@@ th : and there is none u@@ pri@@ ght among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keep the doors of TH@@ Y m@@ outh from her that li@@ eth in TH@@ Y bos@@ om .
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th the father , the daughter ris@@ eth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
re@@ jo@@ ice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in d@@ ark@@ ness , the Lord shall be a light un@@ to me .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ lead my cause , and exec@@ ute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall be@@ hold his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
in that day also he shall come even to the@@ e from As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and from the for@@ ti@@ fied cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
the nations shall see and be con@@ founded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their m@@ outh , their e@@ ars shall be de@@ af .
they shall lick the d@@ ust like a ser@@ p@@ ent , they shall move out of their ho@@ les like wor@@ ms of the ear@@ th : they shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall fear because of the@@ e .
he will turn again , he will have comp@@ as@@ sion upon us ; he will sub@@ due our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities ; and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t cast all their sin@@ s into the dep@@ ths of the sea .
God is Je@@ al@@ ous , and the Lord reven@@ get@@ h ; the Lord reven@@ get@@ h , and is fur@@ ious ; the Lord will take ven@@ ge@@ ance on his ad@@ vers@@ aries , and he reser@@ vet@@ h wr@@ ath for his enem@@ ies .
the Lord is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will not at all acqu@@ it the w@@ ic@@ ked : the Lord hat@@ h his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .
he re@@ bu@@ ket@@ h the sea , and mak@@ eth it d@@ ry , and dri@@ eth up all the rivers : B@@ ash@@ an langu@@ is@@ het@@ h , and Car@@ mel , and the f@@ lower of Lebanon langu@@ is@@ het@@ h .
the mountains quake at him , and the hil@@ ls mel@@ t , and the ear@@ th is burned at his presence , ye@@ a , the world , and all that d@@ well there@@ in .
who can stand before his in@@ dign@@ ation ? and who can abide in the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger ? his fur@@ y is p@@ oured out like fire , and the ro@@ cks are thrown down by him .
the Lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he know@@ eth them that trust in him .
but with an over@@ running flood he will make an ut@@ ter end of the place there@@ of , and d@@ ark@@ ness shall pursue his enem@@ ies .
for while they be fol@@ den together as thor@@ ns , and while they are dr@@ un@@ ken as dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds , they shall be dev@@ oured as st@@ ub@@ ble fully d@@ ry .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have aff@@ lic@@ ted the@@ e , I will aff@@ lic@@ t the@@ e no more .
he that d@@ ash@@ eth in pieces is come up before TH@@ Y face : keep the munition , watch the way , make TH@@ Y lo@@ ins strong , for@@ ti@@ fy TH@@ Y power m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly .
for the Lord hat@@ h turned away the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Jac@@ o@@ b , as the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Israel : for the emp@@ ti@@ ers have emp@@ tied them out , and marred their v@@ ine branches .
the shield of his m@@ igh@@ ty men is made red , the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let : the char@@ i@@ ots shall be with f@@ laming tor@@ ches in the day of his preparation , and the f@@ ir trees shall be ter@@ ri@@ bly shaken .
the char@@ i@@ ots shall ra@@ ge in the streets , they shall j@@ ust@@ le one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like tor@@ ches , they shall run like the ligh@@ t@@ nings .
and H@@ uz@@ za@@ b shall be led away cap@@ tive , she shall be brought up , and her ma@@ ids shall lead her as with the voice of d@@ ov@@ es , tab@@ ering upon their bre@@ asts .
take ye the sp@@ oil of silver , take the sp@@ oil of gold : for there is none end of the store and gl@@ ory out of all the pleas@@ ant furniture .
she is empty , and vo@@ id , and waste : and the heart mel@@ te@@ th , and the k@@ ne@@ es sm@@ ite together , and much p@@ ain is in all lo@@ ins , and the faces of them all gather black@@ ness .
where is the d@@ wel@@ ling of the li@@ ons , and the fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ place of the young li@@ ons , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whel@@ p , and none made them afraid ?
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whel@@ ps , and st@@ ran@@ g@@ led for his li@@ on@@ esses , and filled his ho@@ les with pre@@ y , and his den@@ s with rav@@ in .
the no@@ ise of a w@@ hip , and the no@@ ise of the r@@ att@@ ling of the whe@@ els , and of the pr@@ ans@@ ing hor@@ ses , and of the jum@@ ping char@@ i@@ ots .
the Hor@@ sem@@ an lif@@ te@@ th up both the bright s@@ word and the g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar : and there is a multi@@ tude of sla@@ in , and a great number of car@@ cases ; and there is none end of their cor@@ p@@ ses ; they st@@ um@@ ble upon their cor@@ p@@ ses :
be@@ hold , I am against the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; and I will discover TH@@ Y sk@@ ir@@ ts upon TH@@ Y face , and I will she@@ w the nations TH@@ Y nak@@ edn@@ ess , and the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms TH@@ Y sh@@ ame .
and I will cast ab@@ omin@@ able Fil@@ th upon the@@ e , and make the@@ e v@@ ile , and will set the@@ e as a gaz@@ ing@@ stock .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon the@@ e shall flee from the@@ e , and say , N@@ inev@@ e@@ h is laid waste : who will b@@ emo@@ an her ? wh@@ ence shall I seek comfor@@ ters for the@@ e ?
yet was she carried away , she went into cap@@ tivity : her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honour@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in cha@@ ins .
all TH@@ Y strong holds shall be like fi@@ g trees with the fir@@ stri@@ pe fig@@ s : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the m@@ outh of the e@@ ater .
be@@ hold , TH@@ Y people in the mid@@ st of the@@ e are women : the gates of TH@@ Y land shall be set wide open un@@ to th@@ ine enem@@ ies : the fire shall dev@@ our TH@@ Y bars .
TH@@ Y crow@@ ned are as the loc@@ ust@@ s , and TH@@ Y cap@@ tains as the great gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , which camp in the h@@ ed@@ ges in the cold day , but when the sun ar@@ is@@ eth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
there is no he@@ aling of TH@@ Y bru@@ ise ; TH@@ Y wo@@ und is gri@@ ev@@ ous : all that hear the bru@@ it of the@@ e shall cla@@ p the hands over the@@ e : for upon whom hat@@ h not TH@@ Y w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess passed continu@@ ally ?
be@@ hold ye among the he@@ a@@ then , and regard , and wonder mar@@ v@@ el@@ lo@@ us@@ ly : for I will work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
for , lo , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and has@@ ty nation , which shall march through the b@@ read@@ th of the land , to poss@@ ess the d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places that are not the@@ ir@@ s .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than the le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves : and their hor@@ se@@ men shall spread themselves , and their hor@@ se@@ men shall come from far ; they shall fly as the e@@ ag@@ le that has@@ te@@ th to eat .
they shall come all for violence : their faces shall su@@ p up as the east wind , and they shall gather the cap@@ tivity as the s@@ and .
and they shall sco@@ ff at the kings , and the pr@@ inces shall be a scor@@ n un@@ to them : they shall der@@ ide every strong hold ; for they shall he@@ ap d@@ ust , and take it .
T@@ ho@@ u art of pu@@ rer eyes than to be@@ hold ev@@ il , and can@@ st not look on in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : where@@ fore lo@@ ok@@ est th@@ ou upon them that deal t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and hol@@ dest TH@@ Y ton@@ gue when the w@@ ic@@ ked dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th the man that is more righ@@ te@@ ous than he ?
and mak@@ est men as the fis@@ hes of the sea , as the cre@@ eping things , that have no ru@@ ler over them ?
they take up all of them with the an@@ gle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their dra@@ g : therefore they re@@ jo@@ ice and are glad .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the to@@ wer , and will watch to see what he will say un@@ to me , and what I shall answer when I am re@@ proved .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will su@@ rely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast sp@@ o@@ iled many nations , all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people shall sp@@ oil the@@ e ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that d@@ well there@@ in .
Wo@@ e to him that c@@ ov@@ ete@@ th an ev@@ il c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness to his house , that he may set his n@@ est on high , that he may be delivered from the power of ev@@ il !
be@@ hold , is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall we@@ ary themselves for very van@@ ity ?
Wo@@ e un@@ to him that gi@@ vet@@ h his neighbour drink , that p@@ ut@@ test TH@@ Y bot@@ tle to him , and mak@@ est him dr@@ un@@ ken also , that th@@ ou may@@ est look on their nak@@ edn@@ ess !
and his bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was as the light ; he had hor@@ ns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
was the Lord disp@@ le@@ ased against the rivers ? was th@@ ine an@@ ger against the rivers ? was TH@@ Y wr@@ ath against the sea , that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st ride upon th@@ ine hor@@ ses and TH@@ Y char@@ i@@ ots of sal@@ vation ?
TH@@ Y bo@@ w was made quite nak@@ ed , according to the o@@ aths of the tri@@ bes , even TH@@ Y word . Se@@ lah . T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st cle@@ ave the ear@@ th with rivers .
the mountains saw the@@ e , and they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led : the over@@ flow@@ ing of the water passed by : the deep ut@@ tered his voice , and lifted up his hands on high .
the sun and moon stood still in their habi@@ tation : at the light of th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws they went , and at the sh@@ ining of TH@@ Y g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ en@@ test forth for the sal@@ vation of TH@@ Y people , even for sal@@ vation with th@@ ine ano@@ in@@ ted ; th@@ ou wo@@ un@@ de@@ d@@ st the head out of the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked , by dis@@ covering the foundation un@@ to the nec@@ k . Se@@ lah .
T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st strike through with his st@@ aves the head of his villages : they came out as a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind to sc@@ at@@ ter me : their re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing was as to dev@@ our the poor secre@@ tly .
the word of the Lord which came un@@ to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of C@@ us@@ hi , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hiz@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will consum@@ e man and be@@ ast ; I will consum@@ e the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and the fis@@ hes of the sea , and the stumb@@ l@@ ing@@ blocks with the w@@ ic@@ ked ; and I will cut off man from off the land , sa@@ ith the Lord .
hold TH@@ Y peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hat@@ h prepared a sacrifice , he hat@@ h bid his guests .
and it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord 's sacrifice , that I will punish the pr@@ inces , and the king 's children , and all such as are clo@@ th@@ ed with st@@ range appar@@ el .
therefore their goods shall become a bo@@ o@@ ty , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation : they shall also build houses , but not in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but not drink the wine there@@ of .
the great day of the Lord is near , it is near , and has@@ te@@ th greatly , even the voice of the day of the Lord : the m@@ igh@@ ty man shall cry there bit@@ ter@@ ly .
that day is a day of wr@@ ath , a day of trouble and dist@@ ress , a day of was@@ ten@@ ess and de@@ so@@ lation , a day of d@@ ark@@ ness and glo@@ omin@@ ess , a day of cl@@ ou@@ ds and th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness ,
seek ye the Lord , all ye me@@ ek of the ear@@ th , which have w@@ rought his judgment ; seek righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , seek me@@ ek@@ ness : it may be ye shall be hi@@ d in the day of the Lord 's an@@ ger .
for Gaza shall be for@@ sak@@ en , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation : they shall drive out Ash@@ do@@ d at the noon day , and E@@ kr@@ on shall be rooted up .
the Lord will be ter@@ ri@@ ble un@@ to them : for he will fam@@ ish all the go@@ ds of the ear@@ th ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the is@@ les of the he@@ a@@ then .
she obe@@ yed not the voice ; she received not correc@@ tion ; she tr@@ usted not in the Lord ; she drew not near to her God .
in that day s@@ halt th@@ ou not be as@@ ha@@ med for all TH@@ Y do@@ ings , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for then I will take away out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e them that re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y pride , and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more be ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty because of my hol@@ y mountain .
I will also leave in the mid@@ st of the@@ e an aff@@ lic@@ ted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the Lord .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel shall not do in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful ton@@ gue be found in their m@@ outh : for they shall fe@@ ed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the Lord hat@@ h taken away TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , he hat@@ h cast out th@@ ine enemy : the king of Israel , even the Lord , is in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt not see ev@@ il any more .
the Lord TH@@ Y God in the mid@@ st of the@@ e is m@@ igh@@ ty ; he will save , he will re@@ jo@@ ice over the@@ e with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over the@@ e with singing .
in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , saying ,
Y@@ e have so@@ wn much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clo@@ the you , but there is none warm ; and he that ear@@ net@@ h wages ear@@ net@@ h wages to put it into a bag with ho@@ les .
and I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the cor@@ n , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground br@@ ing@@ eth forth , and upon men , and upon c@@ attle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
then Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , with all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord their God , and the words of Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , as the Lord their God had sent him , and the people did fear before the Lord .
in the seventh month , in the one and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , came the word of the Lord by the pro@@ phe@@ t Hag@@ ga@@ i , saying ,
speak now to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , and to the resi@@ due of the people , saying ,
who is left among you that saw this house in her first gl@@ ory ? and how do ye see it now ? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing ?
according to the word that I c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with you when ye came out of Egypt , so my spirit remain@@ eth among you : fear ye not .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; Y@@ et once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heav@@ ens , and the ear@@ th , and the sea , and the d@@ ry land ;
in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
consider now from this day and up@@ ward , from the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temp@@ le was laid , consider it .
and again the word of the Lord came un@@ to Hag@@ ga@@ i in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , saying ,
and I will overthrow the th@@ r@@ one of k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , and I will destroy the strength of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the he@@ a@@ then ; and I will overthrow the char@@ i@@ ots , and those that ride in them ; and the hor@@ ses and their ri@@ ders shall come down , every one by the s@@ word of his brother .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
therefore say th@@ ou un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts ; Tur@@ n ye un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , and I will turn un@@ to you , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
upon the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ele@@ venth month , which is the month S@@ eb@@ at , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
I saw by night , and be@@ hold a man ri@@ ding upon a red hor@@ se , and he stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red hor@@ ses , spec@@ k@@ led , and white .
and they answ@@ ered the an@@ gel of the Lord that stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees , and said , We have walked to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th , and , be@@ hold , all the ear@@ th sit@@ te@@ th still , and is at rest .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord answ@@ ered and said , O Lord of hosts , how long w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou not have mer@@ cy on Jer@@ usalem and on the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , against which th@@ ou h@@ ast had in@@ dign@@ ation these thre@@ es@@ core and ten years ?
and I am very sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with the he@@ a@@ then that are at ease : for I was but a little disp@@ le@@ ased , and they helped forward the aff@@ li@@ ction .
for I , sa@@ ith the Lord , will be un@@ to her a wall of fire round about , and will be the gl@@ ory in the mid@@ st of her .
sing and re@@ jo@@ ice , O daughter of Z@@ ion : for , lo , I come , and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sent me un@@ to the@@ e .
and he answ@@ ered and sp@@ ake un@@ to those that stood before him , saying , T@@ ake away the fil@@ thy gar@@ ments from him . and un@@ to him he said , be@@ hold , I have caused th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to pass from the@@ e , and I will clo@@ the the@@ e with change of ra@@ im@@ ent .
and I said , Let them set a fair Mit@@ re upon his head . so they set a fair Mit@@ re upon his head , and clo@@ th@@ ed him with gar@@ ments . and the an@@ gel of the Lord stood by .
and the an@@ gel that talked with me came again , and w@@ aked me , as a man that is w@@ ak@@ ened out of his sle@@ ep ,
and I answ@@ ered again , and said un@@ to him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pip@@ es empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
and , be@@ hold , there was lifted up a tal@@ ent of lead : and this is a woman that sit@@ te@@ th in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their w@@ ings ; for they had w@@ ings like the w@@ ings of a stor@@ k : and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h between the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came four char@@ i@@ ots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of br@@ ass .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ered and said un@@ to me , These are the four spir@@ its of the heav@@ ens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the ear@@ th .
and the bay went forth , and sought to go that they might walk to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th : and he said , G@@ et you hence , walk to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th . so they walked to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th .
then cri@@ ed he upon me , and sp@@ ake un@@ to me , saying , be@@ hold , these that go toward the north country have qu@@ i@@ eted my spirit in the north country .
take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , which are come from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and come th@@ ou the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah ;
then take silver and gold , and make crow@@ ns , and set them upon the head of Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est ;
and speak un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , saying , be@@ hold the man whose name is The branch ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temp@@ le of the Lord :
even he shall build the temp@@ le of the Lord ; and he shall bear the gl@@ ory , and shall sit and rule upon his th@@ r@@ one ; and he shall be a pri@@ est upon his th@@ r@@ one : and the coun@@ sel of peace shall be between them both .
and the crow@@ ns shall be to H@@ ele@@ m , and to To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and to J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , and to H@@ en the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , for a memorial in the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Dar@@ i@@ us , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u ;
speak un@@ to all the people of the land , and to the pri@@ ests , saying , When ye fas@@ ted and mour@@ ned in the fifth and seventh month , even those sev@@ enty years , did ye at all fast un@@ to me , even to me ?
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and drink for yo@@ ur@@ selves ?
and op@@ press not the wi@@ dow , nor the fa@@ ther@@ less , the st@@ ran@@ ger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imag@@ ine ev@@ il against his brother in your heart .
therefore it is come to pass , that as he cri@@ ed , and they would not hear ; so they cri@@ ed , and I would not hear , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; I am returned un@@ to Z@@ ion , and will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem : and Jer@@ usalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the hol@@ y mountain .
for before these days there was no h@@ ire for man , nor any h@@ ire for be@@ ast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the aff@@ li@@ ction : for I set all men every one against his neighbour .
for the se@@ ed shall be prosperous ; the v@@ ine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heav@@ ens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the re@@ mn@@ ant of this people to poss@@ ess all these things .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Spe@@ ak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; exec@@ ute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
the burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and Dam@@ as@@ cus shall be the rest there@@ of : when the eyes of man , as of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , shall be toward the Lord .
and T@@ y@@ ru@@ s did build her@@ self a strong hold , and he@@ ap@@ ed up silver as the d@@ ust , and fine gold as the m@@ ire of the streets .
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and E@@ kr@@ on ; for her expec@@ tation shall be as@@ ha@@ med ; and the king shall per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and I will en@@ camp about mine house because of the army , because of him that pass@@ eth by , and because of him that retur@@ net@@ h : and no op@@ pres@@ sor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
and the Lord shall be seen over them , and his ar@@ row shall go forth as the ligh@@ t@@ ning : and the Lord God shall blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , and shall go with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a cro@@ wn , lifted up as an en@@ sign upon his land .
for how great is his Go@@ od@@ ness , and how great is his beauty ! cor@@ n shall make the young men che@@ er@@ ful , and new wine the ma@@ ids .
ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the Lord shall make bright cl@@ ou@@ ds , and give them sho@@ wers of rain , to every one gr@@ ass in the field .
out of him came forth the cor@@ ner , out of him the na@@ il , out of him the battle bo@@ w , out of him every op@@ pres@@ sor together .
and they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , which tre@@ ad down their enem@@ ies in the m@@ ire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses shall be con@@ founded .
and I will strengthen the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them again to place them ; for I have mer@@ cy upon them : and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am the Lord their God , and will hear them .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord .
and I will so@@ w them among the people : and they shall remember me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children , and turn again .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and L@@ aban@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
and he shall pass through the sea with aff@@ li@@ ction , and shall sm@@ ite the waves in the sea , and all the deep@@ s of the river shall d@@ ry up : and the pride of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a shall be brought down , and the scep@@ tre of Egypt shall de@@ part away .
then said I , I will not fe@@ ed you : that that di@@ eth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the f@@ les@@ h of another .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that w@@ aited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , cast it un@@ to the P@@ ot@@ ter : a good@@ ly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the P@@ ot@@ ter in the house of the Lord .
the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord , which stret@@ ch@@ eth forth the heav@@ ens , and lay@@ eth the foundation of the ear@@ th , and for@@ me@@ th the spirit of man within him .
be@@ hold , I will make Jer@@ usalem a c@@ up of tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling un@@ to all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Ju@@ da@@ h and against Jer@@ usalem .
and in that day will I make Jer@@ usalem a bur@@ den@@ some stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the ear@@ th be gathered together against it .
in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will sm@@ ite every hor@@ se with ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and his Ri@@ der with mad@@ ness : and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will sm@@ ite every hor@@ se of the people with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem ; and he that is fe@@ e@@ ble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the an@@ gel of the Lord before them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jer@@ usalem .
and it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , that I will cut off the names of the id@@ ols out of the land , and they shall no more be remember@@ ed : and also I will cause the pro@@ ph@@ ets and the un@@ clean spirit to pass out of the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall be as@@ ha@@ med every one of his vision , when he hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied ; neither shall they wear a roug@@ h gar@@ ment to dec@@ e@@ ive :
but he shall say , I am no pro@@ phe@@ t , I am an hus@@ b@@ and@@ man ; for man ta@@ ught me to keep c@@ attle from my youth .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , sa@@ ith the Lord , two parts there@@ in shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left there@@ in .
for I will gather all nations against Jer@@ usalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rif@@ led , and the women ra@@ vis@@ hed ; and half of the city shall go forth into cap@@ tivity , and the resi@@ due of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the light shall not be clear , nor dark :
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord , not day , nor night : but it shall come to pass , that at evening time it shall be light .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hin@@ der sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and this shall be the pla@@ gue where@@ with the Lord will sm@@ ite all the people that have fought against Jer@@ usalem ; The@@ ir f@@ les@@ h shall consum@@ e away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consum@@ e away in their ho@@ les , and their ton@@ gue shall consum@@ e away in their m@@ outh .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great t@@ um@@ ult from the Lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
and Ju@@ da@@ h also shall fight at Jer@@ usalem ; and the wealth of all the he@@ a@@ then round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and appar@@ el , in great ab@@ und@@ ance .
and so shall be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the ass , and of all the be@@ asts that shall be in these ten@@ ts , as this pla@@ gue .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jer@@ usalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
and it shall be , that wh@@ os@@ o will not come up of all the families of the ear@@ th un@@ to Jer@@ usalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
in that day shall there be upon the bel@@ ls of the hor@@ ses , H@@ OL@@ IN@@ ESS un@@ to the Lord ; and the po@@ ts in the Lord 's house shall be like the bo@@ w@@ l 's before the alt@@ ar .
but ye have prof@@ an@@ ed it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is pollu@@ ted ; and the fruit there@@ of , even his meat , is con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble .
be@@ hold , I will corrupt your se@@ ed , and spread D@@ ung upon your faces , even the D@@ ung of your so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts ; and one shall take you away with it .
Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and an ab@@ omin@@ ation is committed in Israel and in Jer@@ usalem ; for Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h prof@@ an@@ ed the hol@@ iness of the Lord which he lov@@ ed , and hat@@ h married the daughter of a st@@ range go@@ d .
the Lord will cut off the man that do@@ eth this , the master and the scho@@ lar , out of the tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les of Jac@@ o@@ b , and him that offer@@ eth an offering un@@ to the Lord of hosts .
be@@ hold , I will send my mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to this temp@@ le , even the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , whom ye de@@ light in : be@@ hold , he shall come , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and he shall sit as a refin@@ er and pur@@ if@@ er of silver : and he shall pur@@ ify the sons of L@@ evi , and pur@@ ge them as gold and silver , that they may offer un@@ to the Lord an offering in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast her fruit before the time in the field , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
then they that fear@@ ed the Lord sp@@ ake often one to another : and the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed , and heard it , and a book of re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance was written before him for them that fear@@ ed the Lord , and that thought upon his name .
but un@@ to you that fear my name shall the S@@ un of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness arise with he@@ aling in his w@@ ings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as cal@@ ves of the stall .
and ye shall tre@@ ad down the w@@ ic@@ ked ; for they shall be ashes under the so@@ les of your feet in the day that I shall do this , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and he shall turn the heart of the fa@@ thers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fa@@ thers , lest I come and sm@@ ite the ear@@ th with a cur@@ se .
now the birth of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was es@@ po@@ used to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy gh@@ ost .
then Joseph being raised from sle@@ ep did as the an@@ gel of the Lord had bid@@ den him , and took un@@ to him his wife :
and when he had gathered all the chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes of the people together , he demanded of them where Ch@@ r@@ ist should be born .
and he sent them to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said , G@@ o and search dil@@ ig@@ ently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king , they depar@@ ted ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , ti@@ ll it came and stood over where the young child was .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented un@@ to him gifts ; gold , and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h .
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Her@@ od , they depar@@ ted into their own country another way .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus did reign in Ju@@ da@@ ea in the room of his father Her@@ od , he was afraid to go th@@ ither : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Gal@@ il@@ ee :
and the same John had his ra@@ im@@ ent of C@@ ame@@ l 's ha@@ ir , and a le@@ a@@ thern gir@@ dle about his lo@@ ins ; and his meat was loc@@ ust@@ s and wild hon@@ ey .
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throug@@ h@@ ly pur@@ ge his floor , and gather his wheat into the gar@@ ner ; but he will bur@@ n up the c@@ haf@@ f with un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire .
and J@@ es@@ us , when he was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , went up stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay out of the water : and , lo , the heav@@ ens were opened un@@ to him , and he saw the Spiri@@ t of God des@@ cen@@ ding like a do@@ ve , and ligh@@ ting upon him :
again , the dev@@ il tak@@ eth him up into an exceeding high mountain , and she@@ w@@ eth him all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , and the gl@@ ory of them ;
and leaving N@@ azar@@ eth , he came and d@@ wel@@ t in Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Z@@ ab@@ ul@@ on and N@@ ep@@ h@@ thal@@ im :
and J@@ es@@ us , walk@@ ing by the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , saw two bre@@ th@@ ren , Simon called Peter , and An@@ drew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fis@@ hers .
and going on from th@@ ence , he saw other two bre@@ th@@ ren , James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , in a ship with Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e their father , men@@ ding their n@@ ets ; and he called them .
and his f@@ ame went throughout all Syria : and they brought un@@ to him all si@@ ck people that were taken with di@@ vers diseases and tor@@ ments , and those which were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils , and those which were lun@@ ati@@ ck , and those that had the pal@@ sy ; and he he@@ aled them .
and seeing the multi@@ tu@@ des , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his dis@@ cip@@ les came un@@ to him :
Y@@ e are the salt of the ear@@ th : but if the salt have lost his sav@@ our , where@@ with shall it be sal@@ ted ? it is th@@ en@@ ce@@ forth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be tro@@ dden under fo@@ ot of men .
neither do men light a cand@@ le , and put it under a b@@ ush@@ el , but on a cand@@ le@@ stick ; and it gi@@ vet@@ h light un@@ to all that are in the house .
for I say un@@ to you , That except your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall exceed the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of the s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , ye shall in no case enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en .
Y@@ e have heard that it was said by them of old time , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not kill ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
but I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say to his brother , R@@ aca , shall be in danger of the council : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say , T@@ ho@@ u fo@@ ol , shall be in danger of hell fire .
agree with th@@ ine ad@@ versary quickly , wh@@ il@@ es th@@ ou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the ad@@ versary deliver the@@ e to the judge , and the judge deliver the@@ e to the officer , and th@@ ou be cast into prison .
and if TH@@ Y right eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from the@@ e : for it is profitable for the@@ e that one of TH@@ Y members should per@@ ish , and not that TH@@ Y whole body should be cast into hell .
and if TH@@ Y right hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut if off , and cast it from the@@ e : for it is profitable for the@@ e that one of TH@@ Y members should per@@ ish , and not that TH@@ Y whole body should be cast into hell .
and if any man will sue the@@ e at the law , and take away TH@@ Y co@@ at , let him have TH@@ Y clo@@ ke also .
but I say un@@ to you , Lo@@ ve your enem@@ ies , b@@ less them that cur@@ se you , do good to them that h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for them which desp@@ ite@@ fully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
that ye may be the children of your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en : for he mak@@ eth his sun to rise on the ev@@ il and on the good , and sen@@ de@@ th rain on the just and on the un@@ just .
take heed that ye do not your al@@ ms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en .
but th@@ ou , when th@@ ou pray@@ est , enter into TH@@ Y clos@@ et , and when th@@ ou h@@ ast shut TH@@ Y door , pra@@ y to TH@@ Y F@@ ather which is in secret ; and TH@@ Y F@@ ather which se@@ eth in secret shall reward the@@ e openly .
the light of the body is the eye : if therefore th@@ ine eye be single , TH@@ Y whole body shall be full of light .
but if th@@ ine eye be ev@@ il , TH@@ Y whole body shall be full of d@@ ark@@ ness . if therefore the light that is in the@@ e be d@@ ark@@ ness , how great is that d@@ ark@@ ness !
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , if God so clo@@ the the gr@@ ass of the field , which to day is , and to mor@@ row is cast into the ov@@ en , shall he not much more clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be jud@@ ged : and with what measure ye M@@ ete , it shall be meas@@ ured to you again .
and why be@@ hol@@ dest th@@ ou the mote that is in TH@@ Y brother 's eye , but consider@@ est not the be@@ am that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
or how w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou say to TH@@ Y brother , Let me pull out the mote out of th@@ ine eye ; and , be@@ hold , a be@@ am is in th@@ ine own eye ?
T@@ ho@@ u hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite , first cast out the be@@ am out of th@@ ine own eye ; and then s@@ halt th@@ ou see clearly to cast out the mote out of TH@@ Y brother 's eye .
for every one that ask@@ eth recei@@ vet@@ h ; and he that seek@@ eth fin@@ de@@ th ; and to him that kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h it shall be opened .
or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
if ye then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts un@@ to your children , how much more shall your F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en give good things to them that ask him ?
enter ye in at the stra@@ it gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that le@@ ade@@ th to destruction , and many there be which go in there@@ at :
therefore wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he@@ aret@@ h these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them , I will lik@@ en him un@@ to a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and the rain des@@ cen@@ ded , and the floods came , and the winds ble@@ w , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
and every one that he@@ aret@@ h these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them not , shall be lik@@ ened un@@ to a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , which built his house upon the s@@ and :
and the rain des@@ cen@@ ded , and the floods came , and the winds ble@@ w , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
and when J@@ es@@ us was entered into Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , there came un@@ to him a centur@@ ion , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing him ,
and I say un@@ to you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b , in the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to the centur@@ ion , G@@ o TH@@ Y way ; and as th@@ ou h@@ ast believed , so be it done un@@ to the@@ e . and his ser@@ vant was he@@ aled in the sel@@ f@@ same hour .
and when J@@ es@@ us was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and si@@ ck of a f@@ ever .
when the even was come , they brought un@@ to him many that were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils : and he cast out the spir@@ its with his word , and he@@ aled all that were si@@ ck :
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Ger@@ ges@@ en@@ es , there met him two poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and he said un@@ to them , G@@ o . and when they were come out , they went into the her@@ d of sw@@ ine : and , be@@ hold , the whole her@@ d of sw@@ ine ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the sea , and per@@ ished in the waters .
and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was be@@ fallen to the poss@@ essed of the dev@@ ils .
and , be@@ hold , the whole city came out to meet J@@ es@@ us : and when they saw him , they bes@@ ought him that he would de@@ part out of their co@@ asts .
and , be@@ hold , they brought to him a man si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , lying on a bed : and J@@ es@@ us seeing their faith said un@@ to the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy ; Son , be of good che@@ er ; TH@@ Y sin@@ s be for@@ given the@@ e .
and it came to pass , as J@@ es@@ us sat at meat in the house , be@@ hold , many public@@ ans and sin@@ ners came and sat down with him and his dis@@ cip@@ les .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Can the children of the bri@@ de@@ chamber mour@@ n , as long as the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om is with them ? but the days will come , when the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
no man p@@ ut@@ te@@ th a piece of new clo@@ th un@@ to an old gar@@ ment , for that which is put in to fill it up tak@@ eth from the gar@@ ment , and the rent is made worse .
and , be@@ hold , a woman , which was dis@@ eased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his gar@@ ment :
but J@@ es@@ us turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Da@@ ughter , be of good comfor@@ t ; TH@@ Y faith hat@@ h made the@@ e whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
and J@@ es@@ us went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their syn@@ ago@@ gues , and pre@@ aching the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and he@@ aling every si@@ ck@@ ness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , he was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion on them , because they fa@@ in@@ ted , and were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad , as she@@ ep having no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and when he had called un@@ to him his twelve dis@@ cip@@ les , he gave them power against un@@ clean spir@@ its , to cast them out , and to he@@ al all manner of si@@ ck@@ ness and all manner of disease .
these twelve J@@ es@@ us sent forth , and comman@@ ded them , saying , G@@ o not into the way of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and into any city of the Samar@@ it@@ ans enter ye not :
and if the house be wor@@ thy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not wor@@ thy , let your peace return to you .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye de@@ part out of that house or city , shake off the d@@ ust of your feet .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , It shall be more toler@@ able for the land of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
but be@@ w@@ are of men : for they will deliver you up to the coun@@ cils , and they will s@@ cour@@ ge you in their syn@@ ago@@ gues ;
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be ha@@ ted of all men for my name 's sake : but he that en@@ du@@ re@@ th to the end shall be sav@@ ed .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , ti@@ ll the Son of man be come .
it is enough for the dis@@ cip@@ le that he be as his master , and the ser@@ vant as his lor@@ d . if they have called the master of the house Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
what I tell you in d@@ ark@@ ness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the e@@ ar , that pre@@ ach ye upon the hous@@ et@@ ops .
and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the sou@@ l : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both sou@@ l and body in hell .
for I am come to set a man at vari@@ ance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and he that tak@@ eth not his cross , and follow@@ eth after me , is not wor@@ thy of me .
he that recei@@ vet@@ h a pro@@ phe@@ t in the name of a pro@@ phe@@ t shall receive a pro@@ phe@@ t 's reward ; and he that recei@@ vet@@ h a righ@@ te@@ ous man in the name of a righ@@ te@@ ous man shall receive a righ@@ te@@ ous man 's reward .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give to drink un@@ to one of these little ones a c@@ up of cold water only in the name of a dis@@ cip@@ le , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
the b@@ lin@@ d receive their sight , and the la@@ me walk , the le@@ pers are cleans@@ ed , and the de@@ af hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached to them .
for this is he , of whom it is written , be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before TH@@ Y face , which shall prepare TH@@ Y way before the@@ e .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , A@@ mon@@ g them that are born of women there hat@@ h not risen a greater than John the B@@ ap@@ tist : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing he that is least in the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is greater than he .
and th@@ ou , Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , which art ex@@ al@@ ted un@@ to heav@@ en , s@@ halt be brought down to hell : for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works , which have been done in the@@ e , had been done in So@@ dom , it would have remained until this day .
but I say un@@ to you , That it shall be more toler@@ able for the land of So@@ dom in the day of judgment , than for the@@ e .
all things are delivered un@@ to me of my F@@ ather : and no man know@@ eth the Son , but the F@@ ather ; neither know@@ eth any man the F@@ ather , save the Son , and he to wh@@ om@@ so@@ ever the Son will reveal him .
take my yok@@ e upon you , and learn of me ; for I am me@@ ek and low@@ ly in heart : and ye shall find rest un@@ to your so@@ ul@@ s .
at that time J@@ es@@ us went on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day through the cor@@ n ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les were an hun@@ g@@ red , and began to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of cor@@ n , and to eat .
how he entered into the house of God , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which was not law@@ ful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the pri@@ ests ?
and he said un@@ to them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one she@@ ep , and if it fall into a p@@ it on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
then was brought un@@ to him one poss@@ essed with a dev@@ il , b@@ lin@@ d , and dum@@ b : and he he@@ aled him , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that the b@@ lin@@ d and dum@@ b both sp@@ ake and saw .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and sp@@ oil his goods , except he first bin@@ d the strong man ? and then he will sp@@ oil his house .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth a word against the Son of man , it shall be for@@ given him : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth against the Holy gh@@ ost , it shall not be for@@ given him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth good things : and an ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure br@@ ing@@ eth forth ev@@ il things .
but I say un@@ to you , That every id@@ le word that men shall speak , they shall give account there@@ of in the day of judgment .
and great multi@@ tu@@ des were gathered together un@@ to him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multi@@ tude stood on the shore .
some fell upon st@@ ony places , where they had not much ear@@ th : and for@@ th@@ with they sp@@ run@@ g up , because they had no deep@@ ness of ear@@ th :
he answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , Bec@@ ause it is given un@@ to you to know the my@@ ster@@ ies of the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en , but to them it is not given .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h , to him shall be given , and he shall have more ab@@ und@@ ance : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever hat@@ h not , from him shall be taken away even that he hat@@ h .
for this people 's heart is wa@@ xed gross , and their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and should understand with their heart , and should be conver@@ ted , and I should he@@ al them .
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That many pro@@ ph@@ ets and righ@@ te@@ ous men have desi@@ red to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
when any one he@@ aret@@ h the word of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and under@@ stan@@ de@@ th it not , then co@@ me@@ th the w@@ ic@@ ked one , and cat@@ ch@@ eth away that which was so@@ wn in his heart . this is he which received se@@ ed by the way side .
he also that received se@@ ed among the thor@@ ns is he that he@@ aret@@ h the word ; and the care of this world , and the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful@@ ness of ri@@ ches , ch@@ oke the word , and he bec@@ o@@ me@@ th un@@ fruit@@ ful .
let both grow together until the har@@ v@@ est : and in the time of har@@ v@@ est I will say to the re@@ apers , G@@ ather ye together first the tar@@ es , and bin@@ d them in bun@@ d@@ les to bur@@ n them : but gather the wheat into my bar@@ n .
another par@@ able put he forth un@@ to them , saying , The k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like to a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard se@@ ed , which a man took , and so@@ wed in his field :
which indeed is the least of all se@@ eds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among her@@ bs , and bec@@ o@@ me@@ th a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lo@@ dge in the branches there@@ of .
again , the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like un@@ to treasure hi@@ d in a field ; the which when a man hat@@ h found , he hi@@ de@@ th , and for joy there@@ of go@@ eth and sel@@ le@@ th all that he hat@@ h , and bu@@ yet@@ h that field .
which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
for Her@@ od had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Her@@ odi@@ as ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
and the king was sor@@ ry : nevertheless for the oath 's sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he comman@@ ded it to be given her .
and he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tude to sit down on the gr@@ ass , and took the five lo@@ aves , and the two fis@@ hes , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed , and br@@ ake , and gave the lo@@ aves to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tude .
and when he had sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away , he went up into a mountain apart to pra@@ y : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought un@@ to him all that were dis@@ eased ;
and bes@@ ought him that they might only touch the hem of his gar@@ ment : and as many as touched were made perf@@ ec@@ tly whole .
Y@@ e hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , well did E@@ sa@@ ias pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y of you , saying ,
and J@@ es@@ us depar@@ ted from th@@ ence , and came n@@ igh un@@ to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
In@@ som@@ u@@ ch that the multi@@ tude won@@ dered , when they saw the dum@@ b to speak , the ma@@ imed to be whole , the la@@ me to walk , and the b@@ lin@@ d to see : and they gl@@ ori@@ fied the God of Israel .
and he took the seven lo@@ aves and the fis@@ hes , and gave thanks , and br@@ ake them , and gave to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tude .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven bas@@ kets full .
and in the morning , It will be f@@ oul weather to day : for the sky is red and low@@ ring . O ye hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , ye can dis@@ cer@@ n the face of the sky ; but can ye not dis@@ cer@@ n the signs of the times ?
a w@@ ic@@ ked and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ous generation seek@@ eth after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given un@@ to it , but the sign of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jon@@ as . and he left them , and depar@@ ted .
how is it that ye do not understand that I sp@@ ake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should be@@ w@@ are of the le@@ av@@ en of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and of the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es ?
then understood they how that he b@@ ade them not be@@ w@@ are of the le@@ av@@ en of bread , but of the doc@@ tr@@ ine of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and of the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es .
and I will give un@@ to the@@ e the ke@@ ys of the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d on ear@@ th shall be bound in heav@@ en : and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt loose on ear@@ th shall be lo@@ os@@ ed in heav@@ en .
for the Son of man shall come in the gl@@ ory of his F@@ ather with his an@@ gel@@ s ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
while he yet sp@@ ake , be@@ hold , a bright cl@@ oud over@@ shad@@ owed them : and be@@ hold a voice out of the cl@@ oud , which said , This is my bel@@ ov@@ ed Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
and when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save J@@ es@@ us only .
and as they came down from the mountain , J@@ es@@ us charged them , saying , T@@ ell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen again from the dead .
and when they were come to the multi@@ tude , there came to him a certain man , k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to him , and saying ,
but wh@@ os@@ o shall off@@ end one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his nec@@ k , and that he were dro@@ w@@ ned in the dep@@ th of the sea .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore if TH@@ Y hand or TH@@ Y fo@@ ot off@@ end the@@ e , cut them off , and cast them from the@@ e : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life halt or ma@@ imed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into ever@@ lasting fire .
and if th@@ ine eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from the@@ e : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred she@@ ep , and one of them be gone as@@ tra@@ y , do@@ th he not leave the n@@ in@@ ety and nine , and go@@ eth into the mountains , and seek@@ eth that which is gone as@@ tra@@ y ?
and if so be that he find it , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth more of that she@@ ep , than of the n@@ in@@ ety and nine which went not as@@ tra@@ y .
and if he shall neglec@@ t to hear them , tell it un@@ to the church : but if he neglec@@ t to hear the church , let him be un@@ to the@@ e as an he@@ a@@ then man and a pub@@ lican .
again I say un@@ to you , That if two of you shall agree on ear@@ th as tou@@ ching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my F@@ ather which is in heav@@ en .
but for@@ as@@ much as he had not to pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
then the lor@@ d of that ser@@ vant was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , and lo@@ os@@ ed him , and for@@ gave him the debt .
but the same ser@@ vant went out , and found one of his fel@@ low@@ servants , which owed him an hundred p@@ ence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the thro@@ at , saying , P@@ ay me that th@@ ou ow@@ est .
and his lor@@ d was wro@@ th , and delivered him to the tor@@ ment@@ ors , ti@@ ll he should pay all that was due un@@ to him .
and it came to pass , that when J@@ es@@ us had finished these say@@ ings , he depar@@ ted from Gal@@ il@@ ee , and came into the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea beyond Jordan ;
and I say un@@ to you , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever shall put away his wife , except it be for for@@ nic@@ ation , and shall mar@@ ry another , commit@@ te@@ th ad@@ ul@@ tery : and wh@@ os@@ o marri@@ eth her which is put away do@@ th commit ad@@ ul@@ tery .
for there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were so born from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b : and there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s of men : and there be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which have made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
and again I say un@@ to you , It is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through the eye of a ne@@ ed@@ le , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and every one that hat@@ h for@@ sak@@ en houses , or bre@@ th@@ ren , or s@@ ist@@ ers , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive an hund@@ red@@ fold , and shall inher@@ it ever@@ lasting life .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like un@@ to a man that is an hous@@ ehol@@ der , which went out early in the morning to h@@ ire la@@ bour@@ ers into his v@@ ine@@ yard .
is it not law@@ ful for me to do what I will with mine own ? is th@@ ine eye ev@@ il , because I am good ?
but J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said , Y@@ e know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the c@@ up that I shall drink of , and to be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism that I am b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with ? they say un@@ to him , We are able .
and the multi@@ tu@@ des that went before , and that followed , cri@@ ed , saying , Hos@@ anna to the Son of David : b@@ les@@ sed is he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord ; Hos@@ anna in the highest .
and J@@ es@@ us went into the temp@@ le of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the mon@@ ey@@ chan@@ gers , and the seats of them that sold d@@ ov@@ es ,
for John came un@@ to you in the way of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and ye believed him not : but the public@@ ans and the har@@ lots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , re@@ pen@@ ted not after@@ ward , that ye might believe him .
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , that they might receive the fru@@ its of it .
but when the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the he@@ ir ; come , let us kill him , and let us se@@ ize on his inher@@ it@@ ance .
but when the king heard there@@ of , he was wro@@ th : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those mur@@ der@@ ers , and burned up their city .
so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the w@@ edding was fur@@ n@@ ished with guests .
now there were with us seven bre@@ th@@ ren : and the first , when he had married a wife , dec@@ eased , and , having no issue , left his wife un@@ to his brother :
but as tou@@ ching the resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken un@@ to you by God , saying ,
I am the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
for they bin@@ d heavy bur@@ den@@ s and gri@@ ev@@ ous to be bor@@ ne , and lay them on men 's sho@@ ul@@ ders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fin@@ gers .
and say , If we had been in the days of our fa@@ thers , we would not have been par@@ tak@@ ers with them in the blood of the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , be@@ hold , I send un@@ to you pro@@ ph@@ ets , and wise men , and s@@ cri@@ bes : and some of them ye shall kill and cru@@ ci@@ fy ; and some of them shall ye s@@ cour@@ ge in your syn@@ ago@@ gues , and persec@@ ute them from city to city :
O Jer@@ usalem , Jer@@ usalem , th@@ ou that kil@@ lest the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and st@@ on@@ est them which are sent un@@ to the@@ e , how often would I have gathered TH@@ Y children together , even as a h@@ en gather@@ eth her chic@@ ken@@ s under her w@@ ings , and ye would not !
and J@@ es@@ us went out , and depar@@ ted from the temp@@ le : and his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him for to she@@ w him the buildings of the temp@@ le .
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
for nation shall rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom : and there shall be fam@@ ines , and p@@ esti@@ len@@ ces , and earthquakes , in di@@ vers places .
when ye therefore shall see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , stand in the hol@@ y place , ( wh@@ os@@ o re@@ ade@@ th , let him understand : )
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning co@@ me@@ th out of the east , and sh@@ in@@ eth even un@@ to the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
immediately after the tri@@ bu@@ lation of those days shall the sun be dar@@ ken@@ ed , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heav@@ en , and the powers of the heav@@ ens shall be shaken :
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heav@@ en : and then shall all the tri@@ bes of the ear@@ th mour@@ n , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the cl@@ ou@@ ds of heav@@ en with power and great gl@@ ory .
and he shall send his an@@ gel@@ s with a great sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heav@@ en to the other .
for as in the days that were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k ,
but know this , that if the Go@@ od@@ man of the house had known in what watch the th@@ i@@ ef would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered un@@ to them his goods .
when the Son of man shall come in his gl@@ ory , and all the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s with him , then shall he sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of his gl@@ ory :
for I was an hun@@ g@@ red , and ye gave me meat : I was thir@@ st@@ y , and ye gave me drink : I was a st@@ ran@@ ger , and ye took me in :
nak@@ ed , and ye clo@@ th@@ ed me : I was si@@ ck , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came un@@ to me .
and the King shall answer and say un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , In@@ as@@ much as ye have done it un@@ to one of the least of these my bre@@ th@@ ren , ye have done it un@@ to me .
then assemb@@ led together the chief pri@@ ests , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people , un@@ to the palace of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has ,
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , W@@ her@@ es@@ o@@ ever this g@@ os@@ p@@ el shall be pre@@ ached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hat@@ h done , be told for a memorial of her .
then co@@ me@@ th he to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest : be@@ hold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
and while he yet sp@@ ake , lo , Ju@@ das , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multi@@ tude with s@@ words and st@@ aves , from the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders of the people .
and , be@@ hold , one of them which were with J@@ es@@ us stret@@ ched out his hand , and drew his s@@ word , and struck a ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est 's , and smo@@ te off his e@@ ar .
in that same hour said J@@ es@@ us to the multi@@ tu@@ des , Ar@@ e ye come out as against a th@@ i@@ ef with s@@ words and st@@ aves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temp@@ le , and ye laid no hold on me .
and when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate the governor .
then Ju@@ das , which had bet@@ ray@@ ed him , when he saw that he was condemned , re@@ pen@@ ted himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders ,
and the chief pri@@ ests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not law@@ ful for to put them into the treas@@ ury , because it is the price of blood .
then the soldiers of the governor took J@@ es@@ us into the common hall , and gathered un@@ to him the whole band of soldiers .
and when they had plat@@ ted a cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns , they put it upon his head , and a Re@@ ed in his right hand : and they bo@@ wed the k@@ ne@@ e before him , and mo@@ cked him , saying , ha@@ il , King of the Jews !
and after that they had mo@@ cked him , they took the ro@@ be off from him , and put his own ra@@ im@@ ent on him , and led him away to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and par@@ ted his gar@@ ments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the pro@@ phe@@ t , They par@@ ted my gar@@ ments among them , and upon my ves@@ ture did they cast lots .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay one of them ran , and took a sp@@ un@@ ge , and filled it with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a Re@@ ed , and gave him to drink .
and , be@@ hold , the ve@@ il of the temp@@ le was rent in tw@@ ain from the top to the bottom ; and the ear@@ th did quake , and the ro@@ cks rent ;
now when the centur@@ ion , and they that were with him , watching J@@ es@@ us , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they fear@@ ed greatly , saying , T@@ rul@@ y this was the Son of God .
in the end of the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , as it began to da@@ wn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene and the other Mary to see the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
and , be@@ hold , there was a great earthquake : for the an@@ gel of the Lord des@@ cen@@ ded from heav@@ en , and came and rol@@ led back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ered and said un@@ to the women , Fe@@ ar not ye : for I know that ye seek J@@ es@@ us , which was cru@@ ci@@ fied .
and as they went to tell his dis@@ cip@@ les , be@@ hold , J@@ es@@ us met them , saying , All ha@@ il . and they came and held him by the feet , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
now when they were going , be@@ hold , some of the watch came into the city , and she@@ wed un@@ to the chief pri@@ ests all the things that were done .
teaching them to observe all things wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have comman@@ ded you : and , lo , I am with you al@@ way , even un@@ to the end of the world . A@@ men .
and there went out un@@ to him all the land of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and they of Jer@@ usalem , and were all b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed of him in the river of Jordan , conf@@ essing their sin@@ s .
and John was clo@@ th@@ ed with C@@ ame@@ l 's ha@@ ir , and with a gir@@ dle of a s@@ kin about his lo@@ ins ; and he did eat loc@@ ust@@ s and wild hon@@ ey ;
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay coming up out of the water , he saw the heav@@ ens opened , and the Spiri@@ t like a do@@ ve des@@ cen@@ ding upon him :
now after that John was put in prison , J@@ es@@ us came into Gal@@ il@@ ee , pre@@ aching the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God ,
and when he had gone a little further th@@ ence , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , who also were in the ship men@@ ding their n@@ ets .
and for@@ th@@ with , when they were come out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , they entered into the house of Simon and An@@ drew , with James and John .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought un@@ to him all that were dis@@ eased , and them that were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils .
and there came a le@@ per to him , bes@@ e@@ ec@@ hing him , and k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to him , and saying un@@ to him , If th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t , th@@ ou can@@ st make me clean .
and as soon as he had spoken , immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy depar@@ ted from him , and he was cleans@@ ed .
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay many were gathered together , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he pre@@ ached the word un@@ to them .
and when they could not come n@@ igh un@@ to him for the press , they uncovered the ro@@ of where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy lay .
and it came to pass , that , as J@@ es@@ us sat at meat in his house , many public@@ ans and sin@@ ners sat also together with J@@ es@@ us and his dis@@ cip@@ les : for there were many , and they followed him .
and J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Can the children of the bri@@ de@@ chamber fast , while the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om is with them ? as long as they have the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om with them , they can@@ not fast .
no man also se@@ w@@ eth a piece of new clo@@ th on an old gar@@ ment : else the new piece that filled it up tak@@ eth away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man p@@ ut@@ te@@ th new wine into old bott@@ les : else the new wine do@@ th bur@@ st the bott@@ les , and the wine is sp@@ il@@ led , and the bott@@ les will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bott@@ les .
and it came to pass , that he went through the cor@@ n fields on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les began , as they went , to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of cor@@ n .
how he went into the house of God in the days of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the high pri@@ est , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which is not law@@ ful to eat but for the pri@@ ests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and when he had looked round about on them with an@@ ger , being gri@@ ev@@ ed for the hard@@ ness of their hear@@ ts , he sa@@ ith un@@ to the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand . and he stret@@ ched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and he sp@@ ake to his dis@@ cip@@ les , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multi@@ tude , lest they should th@@ r@@ ong him .
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is bes@@ ide himself .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and sp@@ oil his goods , except he will first bin@@ d the strong man ; and then he will sp@@ oil his house .
and he began again to te@@ ach by the sea side : and there was gathered un@@ to him a great multi@@ tude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multi@@ tude was by the sea on the land .
and it came to pass , as he so@@ wed , some fell by the way side , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air came and dev@@ oured it up .
and some fell on st@@ ony ground , where it had not much ear@@ th ; and immediately it sp@@ ran@@ g up , because it had no dep@@ th of ear@@ th :
and he said un@@ to them , un@@ to you it is given to know the my@@ ster@@ y of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God : but un@@ to them that are without , all these things are done in par@@ ables :
that seeing they may see , and not perce@@ ive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be conver@@ ted , and their sin@@ s should be for@@ given them .
and these are they by the way side , where the word is so@@ wn ; but when they have heard , S@@ atan co@@ me@@ th immediately , and tak@@ eth away the word that was so@@ wn in their hear@@ ts .
and when they had sent away the multi@@ tude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and they came over un@@ to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gad@@ aren@@ es .
because that he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been p@@ lu@@ cked as@@ under by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces : neither could any man t@@ ame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tom@@ bs , cr@@ ying , and cutting himself with stones .
and for@@ th@@ with J@@ es@@ us gave them leave . and the un@@ clean spir@@ its went out , and entered into the sw@@ ine : and the her@@ d ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were ch@@ oked in the sea .
and they that f@@ ed the sw@@ ine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to J@@ es@@ us , and see him that was poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il , and had the Legi@@ on , sitting , and clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they that saw it told them how it be@@ fell to him that was poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il , and also concerning the sw@@ ine .
and when J@@ es@@ us was passed over again by ship un@@ to the other side , much people gathered un@@ to him : and he was n@@ igh un@@ to the sea .
and had suffered many things of many physi@@ cians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bet@@ tered , but rather grew worse ,
and stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay the fo@@ un@@ tain of her blood was dri@@ ed up ; and she felt in her body that she was he@@ aled of that pla@@ gue .
and they la@@ ug@@ hed him to scor@@ n . but when he had put them all out , he tak@@ eth the father and the mother of the dam@@ sel , and them that were with him , and enter@@ eth in where the dam@@ sel was lying .
and he could there do no m@@ igh@@ ty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few si@@ ck folk , and he@@ aled them .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye de@@ part th@@ ence , shake off the d@@ ust under your feet for a testimony against them . Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , It shall be more toler@@ able for So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
and when the daughter of the said Her@@ odi@@ as came in , and dan@@ ced , and pleased Her@@ od and them that sat with him , the king said un@@ to the dam@@ sel , As@@ k of me wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t , and I will give it the@@ e .
and the king was exceeding sor@@ ry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sak@@ es which sat with him , he would not reject her .
and when his dis@@ cip@@ les heard of it , they came and took up his cor@@ p@@ se , and laid it in a tomb .
and the A@@ post@@ les gathered themselves together un@@ to J@@ es@@ us , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had ta@@ ught .
and the people saw them depar@@ ting , and many knew him , and ran af@@ oo@@ t th@@ ither out of all cities , and ou@@ tw@@ ent them , and came together un@@ to him .
and J@@ es@@ us , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion toward them , because they were as she@@ ep not having a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : and he began to te@@ ach them many things .
and when he had taken the five lo@@ aves and the two fis@@ hes , he looked up to heav@@ en , and b@@ les@@ sed , and br@@ ake the lo@@ aves , and gave them to his dis@@ cip@@ les to set before them ; and the two fis@@ hes divided he among them all .
and he went up un@@ to them into the ship ; and the wind ce@@ ased : and they were sor@@ e amaz@@ ed in themselves beyond measure , and won@@ dered .
and when they saw some of his dis@@ cip@@ les eat bread with def@@ iled , that is to say , with un@@ w@@ ash@@ en , hands , they found fault .
for the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , and all the Jews , except they was@@ h their hands of@@ t , eat not , holding the tradition of the el@@ ders .
for lay@@ ing aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the w@@ ashing of po@@ ts and c@@ ups : and many other such like things ye do .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can def@@ ile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that def@@ ile the man .
for from within , out of the heart of men , proceed ev@@ il th@@ ou@@ ghts , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies , for@@ nic@@ ations , murders ,
and from th@@ ence he ar@@ ose , and went into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hi@@ d .
and when she was come to her house , she found the dev@@ il gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
and again , depar@@ ting from the co@@ asts of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , he came un@@ to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , through the mid@@ st of the co@@ asts of Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
and they bring un@@ to him one that was de@@ af , and had an im@@ pedi@@ ment in his speech ; and they bes@@ e@@ ech him to put his hand upon him .
and he comman@@ ded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven lo@@ aves , and gave thanks , and br@@ ake , and gave to his dis@@ cip@@ les to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
so they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven bas@@ kets .
and he took the b@@ lin@@ d man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had sp@@ it on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
and J@@ es@@ us went out , and his dis@@ cip@@ les , into the towns of Ca@@ es@@ area Philip@@ pi : and by the way he asked his dis@@ cip@@ les , saying un@@ to them , whom do men say that I am ?
and he began to te@@ ach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the el@@ ders , and of the chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
but when he had turned about and looked on his dis@@ cip@@ les , he re@@ bu@@ ked Peter , saying , G@@ et the@@ e behind me , S@@ atan : for th@@ ou sav@@ ou@@ rest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
and when he had called the people un@@ to him with his dis@@ cip@@ les also , he said un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will save his life shall lose it ; but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall lose his life for my sake and the g@@ os@@ p@@ el 's , the same shall save it .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , ti@@ ll the Son of man were risen from the dead .
for he ta@@ ught his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said un@@ to them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and he sat down , and called the twelve , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and ser@@ vant of all .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Ch@@ r@@ ist , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall not lose his reward .
and if TH@@ Y hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut it off : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life ma@@ imed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and if TH@@ Y fo@@ ot off@@ end the@@ e , cut it off : it is better for the@@ e to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and if th@@ ine eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out : it is better for the@@ e to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
for every one shall be sal@@ ted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be sal@@ ted with salt .
and he ar@@ ose from th@@ ence , and co@@ me@@ th into the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea by the far@@ ther side of Jordan : and the people resort un@@ to him again ; and , as he was won@@ t , he ta@@ ught them again .
and the dis@@ cip@@ les were ast@@ on@@ ished at his words . but J@@ es@@ us answ@@ er@@ eth again , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in ri@@ ches to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God !
it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through the eye of a ne@@ ed@@ le , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
they said un@@ to him , G@@ rant un@@ to us that we may sit , one on TH@@ Y right hand , and the other on TH@@ Y left hand , in TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
but J@@ es@@ us called them to him , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Y@@ e know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gen@@ ti@@ les exercise l@@ ord@@ ship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
and they went their way , and found the col@@ t tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
and many spread their gar@@ ments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and stra@@ wed them in the way .
and J@@ es@@ us entered into Jer@@ usalem , and into the temp@@ le : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the ev@@ enti@@ de was come , he went out un@@ to B@@ eth@@ any with the twelve .
and seeing a fi@@ g tree af@@ ar off having leaves , he came , if hap@@ ly he might find any thing there@@ on : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of fig@@ s was not yet .
and they come to Jer@@ usalem : and J@@ es@@ us went into the temp@@ le , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the mon@@ ey@@ chan@@ gers , and the seats of them that sold d@@ ov@@ es ;
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say un@@ to this mountain , Be th@@ ou removed , and be th@@ ou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he sa@@ ith shall come to pass ; he shall have wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he sa@@ ith .
and at the season he sent to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men a ser@@ vant , that he might receive from the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
and again he sent un@@ to them another ser@@ vant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away sha@@ me@@ fully handled .
and they sought to lay hold on him , but fear@@ ed the people : for they knew that he had spoken the par@@ able against them : and they left him , and went their way .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? but he , kno@@ wing their hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y temp@@ t ye me ? bring me a pen@@ ny , that I may see it .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering said un@@ to them , ren@@ der to Ca@@ es@@ ar the things that are Ca@@ es@@ ar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . and they mar@@ v@@ elled at him .
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the an@@ gel@@ s which are in heav@@ en .
and as tou@@ ching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Mos@@ es , how in the b@@ ush God sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , I am the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b ?
and th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all TH@@ Y heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , and with all TH@@ Y mind , and with all TH@@ Y strength : this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the sou@@ l , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
and he called un@@ to him his dis@@ cip@@ les , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , That this poor wi@@ dow hat@@ h cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treas@@ ury :
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
for nation shall rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom : and there shall be earthquakes in di@@ vers places , and there shall be fam@@ ines and troub@@ les : these are the begin@@ nings of sor@@ ro@@ ws .
but take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves : for they shall deliver you up to coun@@ cils ; and in the syn@@ ago@@ gues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rul@@ ers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
but when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought be@@ fore@@ hand what ye shall speak , neither do ye pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ate : but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy gh@@ ost .
now the brother shall bet@@ ray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be ha@@ ted of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall en@@ dur@@ e un@@ to the end , the same shall be sav@@ ed .
but when ye shall see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing where it ought not , ( let him that re@@ ade@@ th understand , ) then let them that be in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains :
and then shall he send his an@@ gel@@ s , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the ear@@ th to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of heav@@ en .
for the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and comman@@ ded the Por@@ ter to watch .
after two days was the feast of the pass@@ over , and of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
and being in B@@ eth@@ any in the house of Simon the le@@ per , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an al@@ ab@@ aster box of o@@ in@@ tment of sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard very pre@@ ci@@ ous ; and she br@@ ake the box , and p@@ oured it on his head .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , W@@ her@@ es@@ o@@ ever this g@@ os@@ p@@ el shall be pre@@ ached throughout the whole world , this also that she hat@@ h done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
and wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever he shall go in , say ye to the Go@@ od@@ man of the house , The Mas@@ ter sa@@ ith , W@@ here is the gu@@ est@@ chamber , where I shall eat the pass@@ over with my dis@@ cip@@ les ?
and he took the c@@ up , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all d@@ rank of it .
Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the v@@ ine , until that day that I drink it new in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and he co@@ me@@ th the third time , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; be@@ hold , the Son of man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
and as soon as he was come , he go@@ eth stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay to him , and sa@@ ith , Mas@@ ter , master ; and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and one of them that stood by drew a s@@ word , and smo@@ te a ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his e@@ ar .
and there followed him a certain young man , having a lin@@ en clo@@ th cast about his nak@@ ed body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and Peter followed him af@@ ar off , even into the palace of the high pri@@ est : and he sat with the servants , and war@@ med himself at the fire .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , su@@ rely th@@ ou art one of them : for th@@ ou art a Gal@@ il@@ a@@ ean , and TH@@ Y speech agre@@ eth there@@ to .
and there was one named Bar@@ ab@@ bas , which lay bound with them that had made insur@@ rec@@ tion with him , who had committed murder in the insur@@ rec@@ tion .
and they bring him un@@ to the place gol@@ go@@ th@@ a , which is , being interpreted , The place of a s@@ kul@@ l .
and the super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption of his accus@@ ation was written over , the King of the Jews .
and when the centur@@ ion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cri@@ ed out , and gave up the gh@@ ost , he said , T@@ rul@@ y this man was the Son of God .
and he bought fine lin@@ en , and took him down , and wrapped him in the lin@@ en , and laid him in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re which was he@@ wn out of a rock , and rol@@ led a stone un@@ to the door of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
and when the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath was past , Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , and Mary the mother of James , and Sal@@ ome , had bought swe@@ et sp@@ ices , that they might come and ano@@ int him .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re at the rising of the sun .
and entering into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clo@@ th@@ ed in a long white gar@@ ment ; and they were aff@@ righ@@ ted .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; for they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led and were amaz@@ ed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
after@@ ward he appeared un@@ to the eleven as they sat at meat , and up@@ bra@@ i@@ ded them with their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
so then after the Lord had spoken un@@ to them , he was received up into heav@@ en , and sat on the right hand of God .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ da@@ ea , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the course of A@@ bia : and his wife was of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth .
according to the cust@@ om of the pri@@ est 's office , his lot was to bur@@ n incen@@ se when he went into the temp@@ le of the Lord .
for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , even from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ering said un@@ to him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak un@@ to the@@ e , and to she@@ w the@@ e these glad ti@@ dings .
and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because th@@ ou believ@@ est not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
and when he came out , he could not speak un@@ to them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temp@@ le : for he bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to them , and remained spe@@ ech@@ less .
and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his minist@@ ration were accomplished , he depar@@ ted to his own house .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of sal@@ ut@@ ation this should be .
and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt conce@@ ive in TH@@ Y w@@ om@@ b , and bring forth a son , and s@@ halt call his name J@@ es@@ us .
and the an@@ gel answ@@ ered and said un@@ to her , The Holy gh@@ ost shall come upon the@@ e , and the power of the High@@ est shall over@@ shadow the@@ e : therefore also that hol@@ y thing which shall be born of the@@ e shall be called the Son of God .
and , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y co@@ us@@ in E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth , she hat@@ h also conce@@ ived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called bar@@ ren .
for , lo , as soon as the voice of TH@@ Y sal@@ ut@@ ation so@@ unded in mine e@@ ars , the bab@@ e le@@ ap@@ ed in my w@@ om@@ b for joy .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of his father .
and it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Ca@@ es@@ ar Aug@@ ust@@ us , that all the world should be tax@@ ed .
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ da@@ ea , un@@ to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ; ( because he was of the house and lin@@ e@@ age of David : )
and , lo , the an@@ gel of the Lord came upon them , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord sh@@ one round about them : and they were sor@@ e afraid .
and it came to pass , as the an@@ gel@@ s were gone away from them into heav@@ en , the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds said one to another , Let us now go even un@@ to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hat@@ h made known un@@ to us .
and they came with has@@ te , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the bab@@ e lying in a man@@ ger .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and when the days of her pur@@ ification according to the law of Mos@@ es were accomplished , they brought him to Jer@@ usalem , to present him to the Lord ;
and , be@@ hold , there was a man in Jer@@ usalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out , waiting for the con@@ so@@ lation of Israel : and the Holy gh@@ ost was upon him .
and it was revealed un@@ to him by the Holy gh@@ ost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for mine eyes have seen TH@@ Y sal@@ vation ,
and the child grew , and wa@@ xed strong in spirit , filled with wis@@ dom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temp@@ le , sitting in the mid@@ st of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
now in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar , Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate being governor of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and Her@@ od being te@@ tr@@ arch of Gal@@ il@@ ee , and his brother Philip te@@ tr@@ arch of I@@ tur@@ a@@ ea and of the region of T@@ rac@@ hon@@ itis , and Ly@@ san@@ ias the te@@ tr@@ arch of A@@ bil@@ ene ,
as it is written in the book of the words of E@@ sa@@ ias the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , The voice of one cr@@ ying in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , Pre@@ par@@ e ye the way of the Lord , make his p@@ aths stra@@ ight .
every val@@ ley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the cro@@ oked shall be made stra@@ ight , and the roug@@ h ways shall be made smooth ;
bring forth therefore fru@@ its wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance , and begin not to say within yo@@ ur@@ selves , We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham to our father : for I say un@@ to you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : every tree therefore which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throug@@ h@@ ly pur@@ ge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his gar@@ ner ; but the c@@ haf@@ f he will bur@@ n with fire un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble .
and J@@ es@@ us himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of H@@ eli ,
which was the son of Mat@@ that , which was the son of L@@ evi , which was the son of Mel@@ chi , which was the son of Jan@@ na , which was the son of Joseph ,
which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ ias , which was the son of Am@@ os , which was the son of Na@@ um , which was the son of Es@@ li , which was the son of Nag@@ ge ,
which was the son of M@@ aat@@ h , which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ ias , which was the son of Se@@ me@@ i , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of J@@ uda ,
which was the son of Mel@@ chi , which was the son of Ad@@ di , which was the son of Cos@@ am , which was the son of El@@ mo@@ dam , which was the son of E@@ R ,
which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eli@@ ez@@ er , which was the son of Jor@@ im , which was the son of Mat@@ that , which was the son of L@@ evi ,
which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of J@@ uda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jon@@ an , which was the son of Eli@@ ak@@ im ,
which was the son of M@@ ele@@ a , which was the son of Men@@ an , which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ a , which was the son of Na@@ than , which was the son of David ,
which was the son of J@@ es@@ se , which was the son of Ob@@ ed , which was the son of Bo@@ oz , which was the son of sal@@ mon , which was the son of Na@@ as@@ son ,
which was the son of A@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , which was the son of Ara@@ m , which was the son of Es@@ rom , which was the son of P@@ har@@ es , which was the son of J@@ uda ,
which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an , which was the son of Ar@@ p@@ ha@@ x@@ ad , which was the son of Se@@ m , which was the son of No@@ e , which was the son of La@@ me@@ ch ,
which was the son of M@@ ath@@ us@@ ala , which was the son of E@@ no@@ ch , which was the son of Jar@@ ed , which was the son of Mal@@ ele@@ el , which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an ,
and the dev@@ il , taking him up into an high mountain , she@@ wed un@@ to him all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world in a moment of time .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , G@@ et the@@ e behind me , S@@ atan : for it is written , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt worship the Lord TH@@ Y God , and him only s@@ halt th@@ ou serve .
and he brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and set him on a pin@@ n@@ acle of the temp@@ le , and said un@@ to him , If th@@ ou be the Son of God , cast th@@ y@@ self down from hence :
and J@@ es@@ us returned in the power of the Spiri@@ t into Gal@@ il@@ ee : and there went out a f@@ ame of him through all the region round about .
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the syn@@ ago@@ gue were fas@@ tened on him .
and all they in the syn@@ ago@@ gue , when they heard these things , were filled with wr@@ ath ,
and rose up , and th@@ rust him out of the city , and led him un@@ to the bro@@ w of the hill where@@ on their city was built , that they might cast him down head@@ long .
and he ar@@ ose out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great f@@ ever ; and they bes@@ ought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any si@@ ck with di@@ vers diseases brought them un@@ to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
and when it was day , he depar@@ ted and went into a de@@ sert place : and the people sought him , and came un@@ to him , and stayed him , that he should not de@@ part from them .
and it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gen@@ nes@@ aret ,
and he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and pray@@ ed him that he would th@@ rust out a little from the land . and he sat down , and ta@@ ught the people out of the ship .
and they bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to s@@ ink .
for he was ast@@ on@@ ished , and all that were with him , at the dra@@ ught of the fis@@ hes which they had taken :
and , be@@ hold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a pal@@ sy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multi@@ tude , they went upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and let him down through the ti@@ ling with his cou@@ ch into the mid@@ st before J@@ es@@ us .
and he sp@@ ake also a par@@ able un@@ to them ; No man p@@ ut@@ te@@ th a piece of a new gar@@ ment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new mak@@ eth a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agre@@ eth not with the old .
and it came to pass on the second sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath after the first , that he went through the cor@@ n fields ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les p@@ lu@@ cked the e@@ ars of cor@@ n , and did eat , rub@@ bing them in their hands .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering them said , H@@ ave ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hun@@ g@@ red , and they which were with him ;
how he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the she@@ w@@ bread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not law@@ ful to eat but for the pri@@ ests alone ?
and it came to pass also on another sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , that he entered into the syn@@ ago@@ gue and ta@@ ught : and there was a man whose right hand was with@@ ered .
re@@ jo@@ ice ye in that day , and le@@ ap for joy : for , be@@ hold , your reward is great in heav@@ en : for in the like manner did their fa@@ thers un@@ to the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and un@@ to him that sm@@ ite@@ th the@@ e on the one che@@ ek offer also the other ; and him that tak@@ eth away TH@@ Y clo@@ ke for@@ bid not to take TH@@ Y co@@ at also .
give , and it shall be given un@@ to you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bos@@ om . for with the same measure that ye M@@ ete with@@ al it shall be meas@@ ured to you again .
and why be@@ hol@@ dest th@@ ou the mote that is in TH@@ Y brother 's eye , but perce@@ iv@@ est not the be@@ am that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thor@@ ns men do not gather fig@@ s , nor of a br@@ am@@ ble b@@ ush gather they grap@@ es .
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth that which is good ; and an ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure of his heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth that which is ev@@ il : for of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart his m@@ outh speak@@ eth .
when J@@ es@@ us heard these things , he mar@@ v@@ elled at him , and turned him about , and said un@@ to the people that followed him , I say un@@ to you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the ser@@ vant whole that had been si@@ ck .
now when he came n@@ igh to the gate of the city , be@@ hold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a wi@@ dow : and much people of the city was with her .
this is he , of whom it is written , be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before TH@@ Y face , which shall prepare TH@@ Y way before the@@ e .
for I say un@@ to you , A@@ mon@@ g those that are born of women there is not a greater pro@@ phe@@ t than John the B@@ ap@@ tist : but he that is least in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God is greater than he .
they are like un@@ to children sitting in the market@@ place , and calling one to another , and saying , We have pip@@ ed un@@ to you , and ye have not dan@@ ced ; we have mour@@ ned to you , and ye have not we@@ pt .
and one of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees desi@@ red him that he would eat with him . and he went into the P@@ har@@ is@@ ee 's house , and sat down to meat .
and it came to pass after@@ ward , that he went throughout every city and village , pre@@ aching and she@@ wing the glad ti@@ dings of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God : and the twelve were with him ,
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sp@@ run@@ g up , it with@@ ered away , because it la@@ cked mo@@ ist@@ ure .
those by the way side are they that hear ; then co@@ me@@ th the dev@@ il , and tak@@ eth away the word out of their hear@@ ts , lest they should believe and be sav@@ ed .
they on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temp@@ tation fall away .
and that which fell among thor@@ ns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are ch@@ oked with car@@ es and ri@@ ches and pleas@@ ures of this life , and bring no fruit to perf@@ ection .
no man , when he hat@@ h ligh@@ ted a cand@@ le , cover@@ eth it with a ves@@ sel , or p@@ ut@@ te@@ th it under a bed ; but set@@ te@@ th it on a cand@@ le@@ stick , that they which enter in may see the light .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his dis@@ cip@@ les : and he said un@@ to them , Let us go over un@@ to the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
but as they sa@@ iled he fell as@@ le@@ ep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeop@@ ard@@ y .
and they came to him , and aw@@ oke him , saying , Mas@@ ter , master , we per@@ ish . then he ar@@ ose , and re@@ bu@@ ked the wind and the ra@@ ging of the water : and they ce@@ ased , and there was a calm .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had dev@@ ils long time , and w@@ are no clo@@ th@@ es , neither abo@@ de in any house , but in the tom@@ bs .
then went the dev@@ ils out of the man , and entered into the sw@@ ine : and the her@@ d ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the lake , and were ch@@ oked .
when they that f@@ ed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
then the whole multi@@ tude of the country of the Gad@@ aren@@ es round about bes@@ ought him to de@@ part from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ es@@ us was returned , the people gla@@ dly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
and , be@@ hold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue : and he fell down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and bes@@ ought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hi@@ d , she came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and falling down before him , she declared un@@ to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was he@@ aled immediately .
and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the ma@@ iden .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very d@@ ust from your feet for a testimony against them .
and the A@@ post@@ les , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside priv@@ ately into a de@@ sert place belonging to the city called B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and sp@@ ake un@@ to them of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , and he@@ aled them that had need of he@@ aling .
then he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fis@@ hes , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed them , and br@@ ake , and gave to the dis@@ cip@@ les to set before the multi@@ tude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of frag@@ ments that remained to them twelve bas@@ kets .
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the el@@ ders and chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be sla@@ in , and be raised the third day .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he shall come in his own gl@@ ory , and in his F@@ ather 's , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sle@@ ep : and when they were aw@@ ake , they saw his gl@@ ory , and the two men that stood with him .
and when the voice was past , J@@ es@@ us was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
and as he was yet a coming , the dev@@ il threw him down , and tar@@ e him . and J@@ es@@ us re@@ bu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , and he@@ aled the child , and delivered him again to his father .
and it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly set his face to go to Jer@@ usalem ,
but he turned , and re@@ bu@@ ked them , and said , Y@@ e know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said un@@ to him , Lord , I will follow the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou go@@ est .
Wo@@ e un@@ to the@@ e , Ch@@ or@@ az@@ in ! wo@@ e un@@ to the@@ e , B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida ! for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works had been done in T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago re@@ pen@@ ted , sitting in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th and ashes .
for I tell you , that many pro@@ ph@@ ets and kings have desi@@ red to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
and J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ering said , A certain man went down from Jer@@ usalem to Jer@@ ich@@ o , and fell among th@@ i@@ ev@@ es , which stri@@ pped him of his ra@@ im@@ ent , and wounded him , and depar@@ ted , leaving him half dead .
and likewise a Lev@@ ite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
and went to him , and bound up his wounds , po@@ uring in oil and wine , and set him on his own be@@ ast , and brought him to an In@@ n , and took care of him .
and on the mor@@ row when he depar@@ ted , he took out two p@@ ence , and gave them to the host , and said un@@ to him , T@@ ake care of him ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou sp@@ en@@ dest more , when I come again , I will repay the@@ e .
and he said un@@ to them , When ye pra@@ y , say , Our F@@ ather which art in heav@@ en , H@@ allowed be TH@@ Y name . TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom come . TH@@ Y will be done , as in heav@@ en , so in ear@@ th .
and for@@ give us our sin@@ s ; for we also for@@ give every one that is indebted to us . and lead us not into temp@@ tation ; but deliver us from ev@@ il .
I say un@@ to you , Th@@ ough he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his impor@@ tun@@ ity he will rise and give him as many as he ne@@ ede@@ th .
for every one that ask@@ eth recei@@ vet@@ h ; and he that seek@@ eth fin@@ de@@ th ; and to him that kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h it shall be opened .
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a ser@@ p@@ ent ?
and he was casting out a dev@@ il , and it was dum@@ b . and it came to pass , when the dev@@ il was gone out , the dum@@ b sp@@ ake ; and the people won@@ dered .
when the un@@ clean spirit is gone out of a man , he walk@@ eth through d@@ ry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he sa@@ ith , I will return un@@ to my house wh@@ ence I came out .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth to him seven other spir@@ its more w@@ ic@@ ked than himself ; and they enter in , and d@@ well there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and it came to pass , as he sp@@ ake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed is the w@@ om@@ b that b@@ are the@@ e , and the pap@@ s which th@@ ou h@@ ast suc@@ ked .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when th@@ ine eye is single , TH@@ Y whole body also is full of light ; but when th@@ ine eye is ev@@ il , TH@@ Y body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
if TH@@ Y whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright sh@@ ining of a cand@@ le do@@ th give the@@ e light .
Wo@@ e un@@ to you , s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
and as he said these things un@@ to them , the s@@ cri@@ bes and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees began to urge him ve@@ hem@@ ently , and to prov@@ oke him to speak of many things :
in the mean time , when there were gathered together an in@@ num@@ er@@ able multi@@ tude of people , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that they tro@@ de one upon another , he began to say un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les first of all , be@@ w@@ are ye of the le@@ av@@ en of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , which is hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
therefore wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye have spoken in d@@ ark@@ ness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the e@@ ar in clos@@ ets shall be proclaimed upon the hous@@ et@@ ops .
and I say un@@ to you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be for@@ given him : but un@@ to him that b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ th against the Holy gh@@ ost it shall not be for@@ given .
if then God so clo@@ the the gr@@ ass , which is to day in the field , and to mor@@ row is cast into the ov@@ en ; how much more will he clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
and ye yo@@ ur@@ selves like un@@ to men that wait for their lor@@ d , when he will return from the w@@ edding ; that when he co@@ me@@ th and kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h , they may open un@@ to him immediately .
b@@ les@@ sed are those servants , whom the lor@@ d when he co@@ me@@ th shall find watching : veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , that he shall gir@@ d himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , b@@ les@@ sed are those servants .
and this know , that if the Go@@ od@@ man of the house had known what hour the th@@ i@@ ef would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and that ser@@ vant , which knew his lor@@ d 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stri@@ pes .
the father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and , be@@ hold , there was a woman which had a spirit of in@@ fir@@ mity E@@ igh@@ teen years , and was bo@@ wed together , and could in no wise lift up her@@ self .
the Lord then answ@@ ered him , and said , T@@ ho@@ u hy@@ po@@ cr@@ ite , do@@ th not each one of you on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath loose his o@@ x or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to wat@@ ering ?
it is like a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard se@@ ed , which a man took , and cast into his gar@@ den ; and it grew , and wa@@ xed a great tree ; and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air lo@@ d@@ ged in the branches of it .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
O Jer@@ usalem , Jer@@ usalem , which kil@@ lest the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and st@@ on@@ est them that are sent un@@ to the@@ e ; how often would I have gathered TH@@ Y children together , as a h@@ en do@@ th gather her bro@@ od under her w@@ ings , and ye would not !
be@@ hold , your house is left un@@ to you de@@ so@@ late : and veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , b@@ les@@ sed is he that co@@ me@@ th in the name of the Lord .
and it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief P@@ har@@ is@@ ees to eat bread on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , that they watched him .
and answ@@ ered them , saying , Wh@@ ich of you shall have an ass or an o@@ x fallen into a p@@ it , and will not stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay pull him out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed is he that shall eat bread in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sen@@ de@@ th an am@@ bas@@ sa@@ ge , and desi@@ re@@ th conditions of peace .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill ; but men cast it out . he that hat@@ h e@@ ars to hear , let him hear .
and when she hat@@ h found it , she cal@@ le@@ th her friends and her neighbours together , saying , re@@ jo@@ ice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
and he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and bring hi@@ ther the fat@@ ted cal@@ f , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be mer@@ ry :
it was meet that we should make mer@@ ry , and be glad : for this TH@@ Y brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
and he called him , and said un@@ to him , Ho@@ w is it that I hear this of the@@ e ? give an account of TH@@ Y ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship ; for th@@ ou may@@ est be no longer ste@@ ward .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship , they may receive me into their houses .
and he cri@@ ed and said , F@@ ather Ab@@ ra@@ ham , have mer@@ cy on me , and send Lazar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his fin@@ ger in water , and co@@ ol my ton@@ gue ; for I am tor@@ mented in this fla@@ me .
and bes@@ ide all this , between us and you there is a great gul@@ f fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you can@@ not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from th@@ ence .
and will not rather say un@@ to him , Mak@@ e ready where@@ with I may su@@ p , and gir@@ d th@@ y@@ self , and serve me , ti@@ ll I have e@@ aten and dr@@ un@@ ken ; and after@@ ward th@@ ou s@@ halt eat and drink ?
and when he saw them , he said un@@ to them , G@@ o she@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the pri@@ ests . and it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleans@@ ed .
and he said un@@ to the dis@@ cip@@ les , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , that ligh@@ ten@@ eth out of the one part under heav@@ en , sh@@ in@@ eth un@@ to the other part under heav@@ en ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
and as it was in the days of No@@ e , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
they did eat , they d@@ rank , they married wi@@ ves , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat , they d@@ rank , they bought , they sold , they plan@@ ted , they buil@@ ded ;
in that day , he which shall be upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and his stu@@ ff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
for it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
then he took un@@ to him the twelve , and said un@@ to them , be@@ hold , we go up to Jer@@ usalem , and all things that are written by the pro@@ ph@@ ets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
and it came to pass , that as he was come n@@ igh un@@ to Jer@@ ich@@ o , a certain b@@ lin@@ d man sat by the way side beg@@ ging :
and , be@@ hold , there was a man named Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ e@@ us , which was the chief among the public@@ ans , and he was rich .
and when J@@ es@@ us came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said un@@ to him , Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ e@@ us , make has@@ te , and come down ; for to day I must abide at TH@@ Y house .
and Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ e@@ us stood , and said un@@ to the Lord ; be@@ hold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accus@@ ation , I restore him fo@@ ur@@ fold .
and it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the k@@ ing@@ dom , then he comman@@ ded these servants to be called un@@ to him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
for I fear@@ ed the@@ e , because th@@ ou art an a@@ ust@@ ere man : th@@ ou tak@@ est up that th@@ ou lay@@ ed@@ st not down , and re@@ ap@@ est that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not so@@ w .
saying , If th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st known , even th@@ ou , at least in this TH@@ Y day , the things which belong un@@ to TH@@ Y peace ! but now they are hi@@ d from th@@ ine eyes .
for the days shall come upon the@@ e , that th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall cast a tren@@ ch about the@@ e , and comp@@ ass the@@ e round , and keep the@@ e in on every side ,
and shall lay the@@ e even with the ground , and TH@@ Y children within the@@ e ; and they shall not leave in the@@ e one stone upon another ; because th@@ ou k@@ newest not the time of TH@@ Y vis@@ itation .
and he went into the temp@@ le , and began to cast out them that sold there@@ in , and them that bought ;
and it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he ta@@ ught the people in the temp@@ le , and pre@@ ached the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes came upon him with the el@@ ders ,
then began he to speak to the people this par@@ able ; A certain man plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and let it forth to hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a ser@@ vant to the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men , that they should give him of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard : but the hus@@ b@@ and@@ men beat him , and sent him away empty .
and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they fear@@ ed the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this par@@ able against them .
but he perceived their craf@@ tin@@ ess , and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y temp@@ t ye me ?
but they which shall be accounted wor@@ thy to obtain that world , and the resur@@ rec@@ tion from the dead , neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage :
neither can they die any more : for they are equal un@@ to the an@@ gel@@ s ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resur@@ rec@@ tion .
but when ye shall hear of wars and commo@@ tions , be not ter@@ ri@@ fied : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persec@@ ute you , deliver@@ ing you up to the syn@@ ago@@ gues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rul@@ ers for my name 's sake .
and ye shall be bet@@ ray@@ ed both by parents , and bre@@ th@@ ren , and k@@ ins@@ fol@@ ks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
then let them which are in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the mid@@ st of it de@@ part out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter there@@ into .
but wo@@ e un@@ to them that are with child , and to them that give su@@ ck , in those days ! for there shall be great dist@@ ress in the land , and wr@@ ath upon this people .
and they shall fall by the edge of the s@@ word , and shall be led away cap@@ tive into all nations : and Jer@@ usalem shall be tro@@ dden down of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , until the times of the Gen@@ ti@@ les be fulfilled .
and there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the ear@@ th dist@@ ress of nations , with per@@ p@@ lex@@ ity ; the sea and the waves ro@@ aring ;
men 's hear@@ ts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the ear@@ th : for the powers of heav@@ en shall be shaken .
when they now sho@@ ot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now n@@ igh at hand .
watch ye therefore , and pra@@ y always , that ye may be accounted wor@@ thy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temp@@ le ; and at night he went out , and abo@@ de in the mount that is called the mount of ol@@ ives .
then J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to the chief pri@@ ests , and cap@@ tains of the temp@@ le , and the el@@ ders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a th@@ i@@ ef , with s@@ words and st@@ aves ?
then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high pri@@ est 's house . and Peter followed af@@ ar off .
and when they had kin@@ d@@ led a fire in the mid@@ st of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
and when they had b@@ lin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , who is it that smo@@ te the@@ e ?
and as soon as it was day , the el@@ ders of the people and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
and if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged un@@ to Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who himself also was at Jer@@ usalem at that time .
and when Her@@ od saw J@@ es@@ us , he was exceeding glad : for he was desi@@ ro@@ us to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some mir@@ acle done by him .
and Her@@ od with his men of war set him at n@@ ought , and mo@@ cked him , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in a gor@@ ge@@ ous ro@@ be , and sent him again to P@@ il@@ ate .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cy@@ ren@@ ian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after J@@ es@@ us .
for , be@@ hold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , b@@ les@@ sed are the bar@@ ren , and the w@@ om@@ bs that never b@@ are , and the pap@@ s which never gave su@@ ck .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Cal@@ v@@ ary , there they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and the mal@@ ef@@ actors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , this IS the King of the Jews .
and , be@@ hold , there was a man named Joseph , a coun@@ seller ; and he was a good man , and a just :
( the same had not consen@@ ted to the coun@@ sel and de@@ ed of them ; ) he was of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a city of the Jews : who also himself w@@ aited for the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in lin@@ en , and laid it in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re that was he@@ wn in stone , where@@ in never man before was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , bringing the sp@@ ices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
it was Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , and Jo@@ anna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things un@@ to the A@@ post@@ les .
and it came to pass , that , while they commun@@ ed together and reas@@ oned , J@@ es@@ us himself drew near , and went with them .
and the one of them , whose name was C@@ le@@ op@@ as , answ@@ ering said un@@ to him , Art th@@ ou only a st@@ ran@@ ger in Jer@@ usalem , and h@@ ast not known the things which are come to pass there@@ in these days ?
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and b@@ les@@ sed it , and br@@ ake , and gave to them .
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jer@@ usalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and , be@@ hold , I send the promise of my F@@ ather upon you : but tar@@ ry ye in the city of Jer@@ usalem , until ye be en@@ du@@ ed with power from on high .
and it came to pass , while he b@@ les@@ sed them , he was par@@ ted from them , and carried up into heav@@ en .
but as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
and the Wor@@ d was made f@@ les@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t among us , ( and we be@@ held his gl@@ ory , the gl@@ ory as of the only be@@ gotten of the F@@ ather , ) full of grace and truth .
and I knew him not : but he that sent me to b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze with water , the same said un@@ to me , U@@ p@@ on whom th@@ ou s@@ halt see the Spiri@@ t des@@ cen@@ ding , and remaining on him , the same is he which b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ eth with the Holy gh@@ ost .
and he sa@@ ith un@@ to him , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , Her@@ e@@ after ye shall see heav@@ en open , and the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding upon the Son of man .
after this he went down to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , he , and his mother , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his dis@@ cip@@ les : and they continued there not many days .
and when he had made a s@@ cour@@ ge of small cor@@ ds , he dro@@ ve them all out of the temp@@ le , and the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en ; and p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw the tables ;
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his dis@@ cip@@ les remember@@ ed that he had said this un@@ to them ; and they believed the s@@ crip@@ ture , and the word which J@@ es@@ us had said .
now when he was in Jer@@ usalem at the pass@@ over , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the mir@@ ac@@ les which he did .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , except a man be born of water and of the Spiri@@ t , he can@@ not enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
that which is born of the f@@ les@@ h is f@@ les@@ h ; and that which is born of the Spiri@@ t is spirit .
the wind b@@ low@@ eth where it liste@@ th , and th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound there@@ of , but can@@ st not tell wh@@ ence it co@@ me@@ th , and w@@ hi@@ ther it go@@ eth : so is every one that is born of the Spiri@@ t .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
if I have told you earth@@ ly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heav@@ en@@ ly things ?
and no man hat@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en , but he that came down from heav@@ en , even the Son of man which is in heav@@ en .
he that believ@@ eth on him is not condemned : but he that believ@@ eth not is condemned already , because he hat@@ h not believed in the name of the only be@@ gotten Son of God .
he that hat@@ h the bri@@ de is the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om : but the friend of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , which stan@@ de@@ th and he@@ aret@@ h him , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ eth greatly because of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that co@@ me@@ th from above is above all : he that is of the ear@@ th is earth@@ ly , and speak@@ eth of the ear@@ th : he that co@@ me@@ th from heav@@ en is above all .
then co@@ me@@ th he to a city of Samar@@ ia , which is called Sy@@ cha@@ r , near to the par@@ cel of ground that Jac@@ o@@ b gave to his son Joseph .
but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever drin@@ ket@@ h of the water that I shall give him shall never thir@@ st ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water spr@@ inging up into ever@@ lasting life .
then when he was come into Gal@@ il@@ ee , the Gal@@ il@@ a@@ e@@ ans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jer@@ usalem at the feast : for they also went un@@ to the feast .
when he heard that J@@ es@@ us was come out of Ju@@ da@@ ea into Gal@@ il@@ ee , he went un@@ to him , and bes@@ ought him that he would come down , and he@@ al his son : for he was at the point of death .
J@@ es@@ us sa@@ ith un@@ to him , G@@ o TH@@ Y way ; TH@@ Y son li@@ vet@@ h . and the man believed the word that J@@ es@@ us had spoken un@@ to him , and he went his way .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Th@@ y son li@@ vet@@ h .
now there is at Jer@@ usalem by the she@@ ep market a pool , which is called in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue B@@ eth@@ es@@ da , having five por@@ ches .
in these lay a great multi@@ tude of im@@ po@@ tent folk , of b@@ lin@@ d , halt , with@@ ered , waiting for the moving of the water .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and therefore did the Jews persec@@ ute J@@ es@@ us , and sought to s@@ lay him , because he had done these things on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
then answ@@ ered J@@ es@@ us and said un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he se@@ eth the F@@ ather do : for what things so@@ ever he do@@ eth , these also do@@ eth the Son likewise .
for the F@@ ather lov@@ eth the Son , and she@@ w@@ eth him all things that himself do@@ eth : and he will she@@ w him greater works than these , that ye may mar@@ v@@ el .
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the F@@ ather . he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th not the Son hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th not the F@@ ather which hat@@ h sent him .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that he@@ aret@@ h my word , and believ@@ eth on him that sent me , hat@@ h ever@@ lasting life , and shall not come into condem@@ nation ; but is passed from death un@@ to life .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
mar@@ v@@ el not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , un@@ to the resur@@ rec@@ tion of life ; and they that have done ev@@ il , un@@ to the resur@@ rec@@ tion of dam@@ nation .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the F@@ ather which hat@@ h sent me .
but I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the F@@ ather hat@@ h given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the F@@ ather hat@@ h sent me .
do not think that I will accuse you to the F@@ ather : there is one that accus@@ eth you , even Mos@@ es , in whom ye trust .
and J@@ es@@ us took the lo@@ aves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fis@@ hes as much as they would .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve bas@@ kets with the frag@@ ments of the five bar@@ ley lo@@ aves , which remained over and above un@@ to them that had e@@ aten .
then those men , when they had seen the mir@@ acle that J@@ es@@ us did , said , This is of a truth that pro@@ phe@@ t that should come into the world .
when J@@ es@@ us therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he depar@@ ted again into a mountain himself alone .
so when they had ro@@ wed about five and twenty or thirty fur@@ lon@@ gs , they see J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing n@@ igh un@@ to the ship : and they were afraid .
( H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there came other boats from Ti@@ ber@@ ias n@@ igh un@@ to the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
when the people therefore saw that J@@ es@@ us was not there , neither his dis@@ cip@@ les , they also took shipping , and came to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , seeking for J@@ es@@ us .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered them and said , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e seek me , not because ye saw the mir@@ ac@@ les , but because ye did eat of the lo@@ aves , and were filled .
all that the F@@ ather gi@@ vet@@ h me shall come to me ; and him that co@@ me@@ th to me I will in no wise cast out .
and this is the F@@ ather 's will which hat@@ h sent me , that of all which he hat@@ h given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which se@@ eth the Son , and believ@@ eth on him , may have ever@@ lasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
it is written in the pro@@ ph@@ ets , An@@ d they shall be all ta@@ ught of God . every man therefore that hat@@ h heard , and hat@@ h learned of the F@@ ather , co@@ me@@ th un@@ to me .
I am the living bread which came down from heav@@ en : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my f@@ les@@ h , which I will give for the life of the world .
then J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , except ye eat the f@@ les@@ h of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
it is the spirit that quic@@ ken@@ eth ; the f@@ les@@ h pro@@ fi@@ te@@ th nothing : the words that I speak un@@ to you , they are spirit , and they are life .
for there is no man that do@@ eth any thing in secret , and he himself seek@@ eth to be known openly . if th@@ ou do these things , she@@ w th@@ y@@ self to the world .
he that speak@@ eth of himself seek@@ eth his own gl@@ ory : but he that seek@@ eth his gl@@ ory that sent him , the same is true , and no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in him .
if a man on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day receive circum@@ c@@ ision , that the law of Mos@@ es should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every w@@ hit whole on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
then cri@@ ed J@@ es@@ us in the temp@@ le as he ta@@ ught , saying , Y@@ e both know me , and ye know wh@@ ence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
( but this sp@@ ake he of the Spiri@@ t , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy gh@@ ost was not yet given ; because that J@@ es@@ us was not yet gl@@ ori@@ fied . )
this they said , temp@@ ting him , that they might have to accuse him . but J@@ es@@ us sto@@ op@@ ed down , and with his fin@@ ger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said un@@ to them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning at the el@@ dest , even un@@ to the last : and J@@ es@@ us was left alone , and the woman standing in the mid@@ st .
these words sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us in the treas@@ ury , as he ta@@ ught in the temp@@ le : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hat@@ h told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a li@@ ar like un@@ to you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but J@@ es@@ us hi@@ d himself , and went out of the temp@@ le , going through the mid@@ st of them , and so passed by .
when he had thus spoken , he sp@@ at on the ground , and made cla@@ y of the sp@@ it@@ tle , and he ano@@ in@@ ted the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d man with the cla@@ y ,
but the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been b@@ lin@@ d , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
but by what means he now se@@ eth , we know not ; or who hat@@ h opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
these words sp@@ ake his parents , because they fear@@ ed the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did conf@@ ess that he was Ch@@ r@@ ist , he should be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
the man answ@@ ered and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y her@@ e@@ in is a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous thing , that ye know not from wh@@ ence he is , and yet he hat@@ h opened mine eyes .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that enter@@ eth not by the door into the she@@ ep@@ fold , but clim@@ bet@@ h up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be sav@@ ed , and shall go in and out , and find pas@@ ture .
the th@@ i@@ ef co@@ me@@ th not , but for to ste@@ al , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly .
but he that is an hi@@ re@@ ling , and not the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , whose own the she@@ ep are not , se@@ eth the w@@ ol@@ f coming , and le@@ av@@ eth the she@@ ep , and fle@@ eth : and the w@@ ol@@ f cat@@ ch@@ eth them , and sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth the she@@ ep .
and other she@@ ep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
no man tak@@ eth it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this comman@@ d@@ ment have I received of my F@@ ather .
and I give un@@ to them eter@@ nal life ; and they shall never per@@ ish , neither shall any man p@@ lu@@ ck them out of my hand .
my F@@ ather , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to p@@ lu@@ ck them out of my F@@ ather 's hand .
then Mar@@ th@@ a , as soon as she heard that J@@ es@@ us was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
and when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secre@@ tly , saying , The Mas@@ ter is come , and cal@@ le@@ th for the@@ e .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comfor@@ ted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up has@@ ti@@ ly and went out , followed her , saying , S@@ he go@@ eth un@@ to the grave to we@@ ep there .
when J@@ es@@ us therefore saw her we@@ eping , and the Jews also we@@ eping which came with her , he gro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit , and was troubled ,
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and J@@ es@@ us lifted up his eyes , and said , F@@ ather , I than@@ k the@@ e that th@@ ou h@@ ast heard me .
and the Jews ' pass@@ over was n@@ igh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jer@@ usalem before the pass@@ over , to pur@@ ify themselves .
now both the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had given a comman@@ d@@ ment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should she@@ w it , that they might take him .
then J@@ es@@ us six days before the pass@@ over came to B@@ eth@@ any , where Lazar@@ us was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
then took Mary a po@@ und of o@@ in@@ tment of sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard , very costly , and ano@@ in@@ ted the feet of J@@ es@@ us , and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir : and the house was filled with the od@@ our of the o@@ in@@ tment .
much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for J@@ es@@ us ' sake only , but that they might see Lazar@@ us also , whom he had raised from the dead .
these things understood not his dis@@ cip@@ les at the first : but when J@@ es@@ us was gl@@ ori@@ fied , then remember@@ ed they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things un@@ to him .
the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazar@@ us out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , b@@ are record .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , except a cor@@ n of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abi@@ de@@ th alone : but if it die , it br@@ ing@@ eth forth much fruit .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my ser@@ vant be : if any man serve me , him will my F@@ ather honour .
then J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Y@@ et a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light , lest d@@ ark@@ ness come upon you : for he that walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness know@@ eth not w@@ hi@@ ther he go@@ eth .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things sp@@ ake J@@ es@@ us , and depar@@ ted , and did hide himself from them .
and if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he that rej@@ ec@@ te@@ th me , and recei@@ vet@@ h not my words , hat@@ h one that jud@@ get@@ h him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the F@@ ather which sent me , he gave me a comman@@ d@@ ment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the pass@@ over , when J@@ es@@ us knew that his hour was come that he should de@@ part out of this world un@@ to the F@@ ather , having lov@@ ed his own which were in the world , he lov@@ ed them un@@ to the end .
after that he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th water into a bas@@ on , and began to was@@ h the dis@@ cip@@ les ' feet , and to wi@@ pe them with the tow@@ el where@@ with he was gir@@ ded .
so after he had was@@ hed their feet , and had taken his gar@@ ments , and was set down again , he said un@@ to them , K@@ now ye what I have done to you ?
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , He it is , to whom I shall give a So@@ p , when I have di@@ pped it . and when he had di@@ pped the So@@ p , he gave it to Ju@@ das Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot , the son of Simon .
little children , yet a little while I am with you . Y@@ e shall seek me : and as I said un@@ to the Jews , W@@ hi@@ ther I go , ye can@@ not come ; so now I say to you .
in my F@@ ather 's house are many man@@ sions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you un@@ to myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Bel@@ i@@ ev@@ est th@@ ou not that I am in the F@@ ather , and the F@@ ather in me ? the words that I speak un@@ to you I speak not of myself : but the F@@ ather that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in me , he do@@ eth the works .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that believ@@ eth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go un@@ to my F@@ ather .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the F@@ ather may be gl@@ ori@@ fied in the Son .
he that hat@@ h my comman@@ d@@ ments , and keep@@ eth them , he it is that lov@@ eth me : and he that lov@@ eth me shall be lov@@ ed of my F@@ ather , and I will love him , and will manif@@ est myself to him .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said un@@ to him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my F@@ ather will love him , and we will come un@@ to him , and make our abo@@ de with him .
he that lov@@ eth me not keep@@ eth not my say@@ ings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the F@@ ather 's which sent me .
but the Com@@ for@@ ter , which is the Holy gh@@ ost , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he shall te@@ ach you all things , and bring all things to your re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have said un@@ to you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give un@@ to you : not as the world gi@@ vet@@ h , give I un@@ to you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
Y@@ e have heard how I said un@@ to you , I go away , and come again un@@ to you . if ye lov@@ ed me , ye would re@@ jo@@ ice , because I said , I go un@@ to the F@@ ather : for my F@@ ather is greater than I@@ .
abide in me , and I in you . as the branch can@@ not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the v@@ ine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
I am the v@@ ine , ye are the branches : he that abi@@ de@@ th in me , and I in him , the same br@@ ing@@ eth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done un@@ to you .
these things have I spoken un@@ to you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
hen@@ ce@@ forth I call you not servants ; for the ser@@ vant know@@ eth not what his lor@@ d do@@ eth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my F@@ ather I have made known un@@ to you .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world ha@@ te@@ th you .
remember the word that I said un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d . if they have persec@@ uted me , they will also persec@@ ute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yo@@ urs also .
but all these things will they do un@@ to you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
but when the Com@@ for@@ ter is come , whom I will send un@@ to you from the F@@ ather , even the Spiri@@ t of truth , which proce@@ ede@@ th from the F@@ ather , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not un@@ to you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedi@@ ent for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Com@@ for@@ ter will not come un@@ to you ; but if I de@@ part , I will send him un@@ to you .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it when he , the Spiri@@ t of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will she@@ w you things to come .
all things that the F@@ ather hat@@ h are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall she@@ w it un@@ to you .
a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the F@@ ather .
now J@@ es@@ us knew that they were desi@@ ro@@ us to ask him , and said un@@ to them , D@@ o ye inqu@@ ire among yo@@ ur@@ selves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , That ye shall we@@ ep and la@@ ment , but the world shall re@@ jo@@ ice : and ye shall be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , but your sor@@ row shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in trav@@ ail hat@@ h sor@@ row , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remember@@ eth no more the an@@ gu@@ ish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye shall ask the F@@ ather in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken un@@ to you in Pro@@ ver@@ bs : but the time co@@ me@@ th , when I shall no more speak un@@ to you in Pro@@ ver@@ bs , but I shall she@@ w you pla@@ in@@ ly of the F@@ ather .
at that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not un@@ to you , that I will pra@@ y the F@@ ather for you :
I came forth from the F@@ ather , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the F@@ ather .
be@@ hold , the hour co@@ me@@ th , ye@@ a , is now come , that ye shall be sc@@ at@@ tered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the F@@ ather is with me .
these things I have spoken un@@ to you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tri@@ bu@@ lation : but be of good che@@ er ; I have overcome the world .
I have manif@@ ested TH@@ Y name un@@ to the men which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me out of the world : th@@ ine they were , and th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them me ; and they have kept TH@@ Y word .
for I have given un@@ to them the words which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me ; and they have received them , and have known su@@ rely that I came out from the@@ e , and they have believed that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st send me .
and now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to the@@ e . Holy F@@ ather , keep through th@@ ine own name those whom th@@ ou h@@ ast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
I pra@@ y not that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take them out of the world , but that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest keep them from the ev@@ il .
I in them , and th@@ ou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that th@@ ou h@@ ast sent me , and h@@ ast lov@@ ed them , as th@@ ou h@@ ast lov@@ ed me .
father , I will that they also , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may be@@ hold my gl@@ ory , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given me : for th@@ ou lov@@ ed@@ st me before the foundation of the world .
as soon then as he had said un@@ to them , I am he , they went back@@ ward , and fell to the ground .
then Simon Peter having a s@@ word drew it , and smo@@ te the high pri@@ est 's ser@@ vant , and cut off his right e@@ ar . the ser@@ vant 's name was Mal@@ ch@@ us .
and led him away to Ann@@ as first ; for he was father in law to C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , which was the high pri@@ est that same year .
and Simon Peter followed J@@ es@@ us , and so did another dis@@ cip@@ le : that dis@@ cip@@ le was known un@@ to the high pri@@ est , and went in with J@@ es@@ us into the palace of the high pri@@ est .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other dis@@ cip@@ le , which was known un@@ to the high pri@@ est , and sp@@ ake un@@ to her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of co@@ als ; for it was cold : and they war@@ med themselves : and Peter stood with them , and war@@ med himself .
then led they J@@ es@@ us from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has un@@ to the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be def@@ iled ; but that they might eat the pass@@ over .
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard that saying , he brought J@@ es@@ us forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pav@@ ement , but in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a .
and P@@ il@@ ate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , J@@ es@@ us of NA@@ Z@@ AR@@ E@@ T@@ H the King of the Jews .
this title then read many of the Jews : for the place where J@@ es@@ us was cru@@ ci@@ fied was n@@ igh to the city : and it was written in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , and Greek , and Latin .
now there stood by the cross of J@@ es@@ us his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of C@@ le@@ op@@ has , and Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene .
now there was set a ves@@ sel full of vin@@ eg@@ ar : and they filled a sp@@ un@@ ge with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it upon hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and put it to his m@@ outh .
and there came also Nic@@ o@@ de@@ mu@@ s , which at the first came to J@@ es@@ us by night , and brought a mi@@ x@@ ture of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h and alo@@ es , about an hundred po@@ und weight .
the first day of the week co@@ me@@ th Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene early , when it was yet dark , un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and se@@ eth the stone taken away from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
then she run@@ net@@ h , and co@@ me@@ th to Simon Peter , and to the other dis@@ cip@@ le , whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and we know not where they have laid him .
but Mary stood without at the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re we@@ eping : and as she we@@ pt , she sto@@ op@@ ed down , and looked into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ,
and se@@ eth two an@@ gel@@ s in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of J@@ es@@ us had la@@ in .
and when he had so said , he she@@ wed un@@ to them his hands and his side . then were the dis@@ cip@@ les glad , when they saw the Lord .
therefore that dis@@ cip@@ le whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed sa@@ ith un@@ to Peter , It is the Lord . now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he gir@@ t his Fis@@ her 's co@@ at un@@ to him , ( for he was nak@@ ed , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
and the other dis@@ cip@@ les came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , ) dra@@ gging the net with fis@@ hes .
as soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of co@@ als there , and fish laid there@@ on , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fis@@ hes , and hundred and fif@@ ty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , When th@@ ou w@@ ast young , th@@ ou gir@@ de@@ d@@ st th@@ y@@ self , and walk@@ ed@@ st w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest : but when th@@ ou s@@ halt be old , th@@ ou s@@ halt stretch forth TH@@ Y hands , and another shall gir@@ d the@@ e , and carry the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest not .
and there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , the which , if they should be written every one , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
and , being assemb@@ led together with them , comman@@ ded them that they should not de@@ part from Jer@@ usalem , but wait for the promise of the F@@ ather , which , sa@@ ith he , ye have heard of me .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy gh@@ ost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses un@@ to me both in Jer@@ usalem , and in all Ju@@ da@@ ea , and in Samar@@ ia , and un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the ear@@ th .
and when they were come in , they went up into an up@@ per room , where abo@@ de both Peter , and James , and John , and An@@ drew , Philip , and Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ olome@@ w , and Matthew , James the son of Alp@@ ha@@ e@@ us , and Simon Zel@@ o@@ tes , and Ju@@ das the brother of James .
and it was known un@@ to all the d@@ wel@@ lers at Jer@@ usalem ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch as that field is called in their proper ton@@ gue , A@@ cel@@ d@@ ama , that is to say , The field of blood .
and when the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
and they were all filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , and began to speak with other ton@@ gues , as the Spiri@@ t gave them ut@@ ter@@ ance .
now when this was no@@ ised abroad , the multi@@ tude came together , and were con@@ founded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be sav@@ ed .
Y@@ e men of Israel , hear these words ; J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth , a man approved of God among you by mir@@ ac@@ les and won@@ ders and signs , which God did by him in the mid@@ st of you , as ye yo@@ ur@@ selves also know :
for David speak@@ eth concerning him , I fore@@ saw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
therefore being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his lo@@ ins , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ;
therefore being by the right hand of God ex@@ al@@ ted , and having received of the F@@ ather the promise of the Holy gh@@ ost , he hat@@ h shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
and they knew that it was he which sat for al@@ ms at the Be@@ autiful gate of the temp@@ le : and they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at that which had happened un@@ to him .
and as the la@@ me man which was he@@ aled held Peter and John , all the people ran together un@@ to them in the por@@ ch that is called Solomon 's , greatly won@@ dering .
for Mos@@ es truly said un@@ to the fa@@ thers , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear in all things wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he shall say un@@ to you .
and it shall come to pass , that every sou@@ l , which will not hear that pro@@ phe@@ t , shall be destroyed from among the people .
Ye@@ a , and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise fore@@ told of these days .
Y@@ e are the children of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which God made with our fa@@ thers , saying un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , An@@ d in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the kin@@ dre@@ ds of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
and they laid hands on them , and put them in hold un@@ to the next day : for it was now ev@@ enti@@ de .
and Ann@@ as the high pri@@ est , and C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kin@@ d@@ red of the high pri@@ est , were gathered together at Jer@@ usalem .
now when they saw the bol@@ d@@ ness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were un@@ learned and ignor@@ ant men , they mar@@ v@@ elled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with J@@ es@@ us .
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , th@@ ou art God , which h@@ ast made heav@@ en , and ear@@ th , and the sea , and all that in them is :
and when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were assemb@@ led together ; and they were all filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , and they sp@@ ake the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
but a certain man named An@@ an@@ ias , with Sap@@ ph@@ ira his wife , sold a possession ,
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not kno@@ wing what was done , came in .
then fell she down stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay at his feet , and yi@@ elded up the gh@@ ost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
and by the hands of the A@@ post@@ les were many signs and won@@ ders w@@ rought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in Solomon 's por@@ ch .
there came also a multi@@ tude out of the cities round about un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , bringing si@@ ck fol@@ ks , and them which were v@@ ex@@ ed with un@@ clean spir@@ its : and they were he@@ aled every one .
then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they fear@@ ed the people , lest they should have been st@@ oned .
and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the Holy gh@@ ost , whom God hat@@ h given to them that obe@@ y him .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the A@@ post@@ les , and beaten them , they comman@@ ded that they should not speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
and the word of God increased ; and the number of the dis@@ cip@@ les multi@@ p@@ lied in Jer@@ usalem greatly ; and a great company of the pri@@ ests were obe@@ di@@ ent to the faith .
then came he out of the land of the Chal@@ da@@ e@@ ans , and d@@ wel@@ t in Char@@ ran : and from th@@ ence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , where@@ in ye now d@@ well .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bon@@ da@@ ge will I judge , said God : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
and were carried over into Sy@@ ch@@ em , and laid in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re that Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Em@@ m@@ or the father of Sy@@ ch@@ em .
I have seen , I have seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send the@@ e into Egypt .
this Mos@@ es whom they refused , saying , Wh@@ o made the@@ e a ru@@ ler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ru@@ ler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the an@@ gel which appeared to him in the b@@ ush .
he brought them out , after that he had she@@ wed won@@ ders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years .
this is that Mos@@ es , which said un@@ to the children of Israel , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear .
saying un@@ to Aaron , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds to go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
Ye@@ a , ye took up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of M@@ olo@@ ch , and the star of your go@@ d Rem@@ ph@@ an , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Bab@@ yl@@ on .
our fa@@ thers had the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , as he had appointed , speaking un@@ to Mos@@ es , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
but he , being full of the Holy gh@@ ost , looked up ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly into heav@@ en , and saw the gl@@ ory of God , and J@@ es@@ us standing on the right hand of God ,
then they cri@@ ed out with a l@@ oud voice , and stopped their e@@ ars , and ran upon him with one accord ,
and Sa@@ ul was con@@ sent@@ ing un@@ to his death . and at that time there was a great persec@@ ution against the church which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and they were all sc@@ at@@ tered abroad throughout the regions of Ju@@ da@@ ea and Samar@@ ia , except the A@@ post@@ les .
for un@@ clean spir@@ its , cr@@ ying with l@@ oud voice , came out of many that were poss@@ essed with them : and many taken with pal@@ sies , and that were la@@ me , were he@@ aled .
now when the A@@ post@@ les which were at Jer@@ usalem heard that Samar@@ ia had received the word of God , they sent un@@ to them Peter and John :
and they , when they had testified and pre@@ ached the word of the Lord , returned to Jer@@ usalem , and pre@@ ached the g@@ os@@ p@@ el in many villages of the Samar@@ it@@ ans .
the place of the s@@ crip@@ ture which he read was this , He was led as a she@@ ep to the sla@@ ughter ; and like a lam@@ b dum@@ b before his s@@ hear@@ er , so opened he not his m@@ outh :
and he comman@@ ded the char@@ i@@ ot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch ; and he b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed him .
and when they were come up out of the water , the Spiri@@ t of the Lord caught away Philip , that the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch saw him no more : and he went on his way re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
and he tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling and ast@@ on@@ ished said , Lord , what w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou have me to do ? and the Lord said un@@ to him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told the@@ e what th@@ ou must do .
and Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose from the ear@@ th ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and when Sa@@ ul was come to Jer@@ usalem , he as@@ say@@ ed to join himself to the dis@@ cip@@ les : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a dis@@ cip@@ le .
and he sp@@ ake bol@@ dly in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and disputed against the Gre@@ cians : but they went about to s@@ lay him .
then had the churches rest throughout all Ju@@ da@@ ea and Gal@@ il@@ ee and Samar@@ ia , and were edi@@ fied ; and walk@@ ing in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfor@@ t of the Holy gh@@ ost , were multi@@ p@@ lied .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the sa@@ ints which d@@ wel@@ t at Ly@@ d@@ da .
and there he found a certain man named A@@ en@@ e@@ as , which had kept his bed eight years , and was si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was si@@ ck , and died : whom when they had was@@ hed , they laid her in an up@@ per chamber .
and for@@ as@@ much as Ly@@ d@@ da was n@@ igh to J@@ op@@ pa , and the dis@@ cip@@ les had heard that Peter was there , they sent un@@ to him two men , desi@@ ring him that he would not delay to come to them .
he lo@@ d@@ get@@ h with one Simon a tan@@ ner , whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell the@@ e what th@@ ou ou@@ gh@@ test to do .
and when the an@@ gel which sp@@ ake un@@ to Cor@@ neli@@ us was depar@@ ted , he called two of his household servants , and a dev@@ out soldier of them that w@@ aited on him continu@@ ally ;
on the mor@@ row , as they went on their journey , and drew n@@ igh un@@ to the city , Peter went up upon the hous@@ et@@ op to pra@@ y about the sixth hour :
and he became very hun@@ gry , and would have e@@ aten : but while they made ready , he fell into a tr@@ ance ,
and saw heav@@ en opened , and a certain ves@@ sel des@@ cen@@ ding un@@ to him , as it had been a great she@@ et k@@ n@@ it at the four cor@@ ners , and let down to the ear@@ th :
now while Peter doub@@ ted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , be@@ hold , the men which were sent from Cor@@ neli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent un@@ to him from Cor@@ neli@@ us ; and said , be@@ hold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause where@@ fore ye are come ?
and as Peter was coming in , Cor@@ neli@@ us met him , and fell down at his feet , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
send therefore to J@@ op@@ pa , and call hi@@ ther Simon , whose sur@@ name is Peter ; he is lo@@ d@@ ged in the house of one Simon a tan@@ ner by the sea side : who , when he co@@ me@@ th , shall speak un@@ to the@@ e .
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jer@@ usalem ; whom they sle@@ w and han@@ ged on a tree :
not to all the people , but un@@ to witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
and he comman@@ ded us to pre@@ ach un@@ to the people , and to testify that it is he which was or@@ da@@ ined of God to be the Judge of quick and dead .
and they of the circum@@ c@@ ision which believed were ast@@ on@@ ished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gen@@ ti@@ les also was p@@ oured out the gift of the Holy gh@@ ost .
upon the which when I had fas@@ tened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fo@@ ur@@ fo@@ oted be@@ asts of the ear@@ th , and wild be@@ asts , and cre@@ eping things , and fo@@ w@@ ls of the air .
now they which were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad upon the persec@@ ution that ar@@ ose about Stephen travelled as far as P@@ hen@@ ice , and Cyprus , and Anti@@ o@@ ch , pre@@ aching the word to none but un@@ to the Jews only .
then ti@@ dings of these things came un@@ to the e@@ ars of the church which was in Jer@@ usalem : and they sent forth Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , that he should go as far as Anti@@ o@@ ch .
and there stood up one of them named Ag@@ ab@@ us , and sig@@ ni@@ fied by the spirit that there should be great de@@ ar@@ th throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Clau@@ di@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar .
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four qu@@ ater@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; inten@@ ding after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
and he went out , and followed him ; and w@@ ist not that it was true which was done by the an@@ gel ; but thought he saw a vision .
and when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose sur@@ name was Mark ; where many were gathered together pray@@ ing .
and when Her@@ od had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the ke@@ epers , and comman@@ ded that they should be put to death . and he went down from Ju@@ da@@ ea to Ca@@ es@@ area , and there abo@@ de .
and upon a set day Her@@ od , ar@@ ray@@ ed in royal appar@@ el , sat upon his th@@ r@@ one , and made an oration un@@ to them .
now there were in the church that was at Anti@@ o@@ ch certain pro@@ ph@@ ets and teachers ; as Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , and Simeon that was called N@@ ig@@ er , and Lu@@ ci@@ us of Cy@@ ren@@ e , and Man@@ a@@ en , which had been brought up with Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch , and Sa@@ ul .
and when they were at S@@ alam@@ is , they pre@@ ached the word of God in the syn@@ ago@@ gues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
and when they had gone through the is@@ le un@@ to Pap@@ ho@@ s , they found a certain sor@@ cer@@ er , a false pro@@ phe@@ t , a J@@ ew , whose name was Bar @@@ -@@ @ J@@ es@@ us :
but when they depar@@ ted from Per@@ ga , they came to Anti@@ o@@ ch in P@@ is@@ idi@@ a , and went into the syn@@ ago@@ gue on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , and sat down .
and after@@ ward they desi@@ red a king : and God gave un@@ to them Sa@@ ul the son of C@@ IS , a man of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , by the space of for@@ ty years .
and as John fulfilled his course , he said , whom think ye that I am ? I am not he . but , be@@ hold , there co@@ me@@ th one after me , whose sho@@ es of his feet I am not wor@@ thy to loose .
for they that d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem , and their rul@@ ers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which are read every sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
but when the Jews saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , they were filled with en@@ v@@ y , and sp@@ ake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contra@@ dic@@ ting and b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ing .
for so hat@@ h the Lord comman@@ ded us , saying , I have set the@@ e to be a light of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be for sal@@ vation un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
and it came to pass in I@@ con@@ ium , that they went both together into the syn@@ ago@@ gue of the Jews , and so sp@@ ake , that a great multi@@ tude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed .
and when there was an assault made both of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and also of the Jews with their rul@@ ers , to use them desp@@ ite@@ fully , and to stone them ,
and there sat a certain man at Ly@@ str@@ a , im@@ po@@ tent in his feet , being a crip@@ ple from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , who never had walked :
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Ly@@ ca@@ on@@ ia , The go@@ ds are come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it , as the dis@@ cip@@ les stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he depar@@ ted with Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as to Der@@ be .
and when they had or@@ da@@ ined them el@@ ders in every church , and had pray@@ ed with fas@@ ting , they commen@@ ded them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
and when they were come , and had gathered the church together , they re@@ hear@@ sed all that God had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith un@@ to the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
when therefore Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as had no small dis@@ sen@@ sion and disp@@ ut@@ ation with them , they determined that Paul and Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , and certain other of them , should go up to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders about this question .
and when they were come to Jer@@ usalem , they were received of the church , and of the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
now therefore why temp@@ t ye God , to put a yok@@ e upon the nec@@ k of the dis@@ cip@@ les , which neither our fa@@ thers nor we were able to bear ?
For@@ as@@ much as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , sub@@ ver@@ ting your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , Y@@ e must be circum@@ c@@ ised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such comman@@ d@@ ment :
then came he to Der@@ be and Ly@@ str@@ a : and , be@@ hold , a certain dis@@ cip@@ le was there , named Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , the son of a certain woman , which was a Je@@ w@@ ess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circum@@ c@@ ised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
and as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decre@@ es for to keep , that were or@@ da@@ ined of the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders which were at Jer@@ usalem .
and on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath we went out of the city by a river side , where pray@@ er was won@@ t to be made ; and we sat down , and sp@@ ake un@@ to the women which res@@ or@@ ted th@@ ither .
and when her mas@@ ters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Sil@@ as , and drew them into the market@@ place un@@ to the rul@@ ers ,
who , having received such a charge , th@@ rust them into the in@@ ner prison , and made their feet fast in the sto@@ cks .
and su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one 's bands were lo@@ os@@ ed .
and the keep@@ er of the prison aw@@ ak@@ ing out of his sle@@ ep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his s@@ word , and would have killed himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had been fled .
but when the Jews of Thessalon@@ ica had knowledge that the word of God was pre@@ ached of Paul at Ber@@ ea , they came th@@ ither also , and s@@ tir@@ red up the people .
now while Paul w@@ aited for them at Athens , his spirit was s@@ tir@@ red in him , when he saw the city wh@@ ol@@ ly given to i@@ do@@ la@@ try .
( for all the Ath@@ en@@ ians and st@@ ran@@ gers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
for as I passed by , and be@@ held your dev@@ o@@ tions , I found an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignor@@ antly worship , him declare I un@@ to you .
and hat@@ h made of one blood all nations of men for to d@@ well on all the face of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h determined the times before appointed , and the bo@@ unds of their habi@@ tation ;
that they should seek the Lord , if hap@@ ly they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
For@@ as@@ much then as we are the off@@ spring of God , we ought not to think that the God@@ head is like un@@ to gold , or silver , or stone , Gra@@ ven by art and man 's device .
because he hat@@ h appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by that man whom he hat@@ h or@@ da@@ ined ; where@@ of he hat@@ h given assur@@ ance un@@ to all men , in that he hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
and he depar@@ ted th@@ ence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named J@@ ust@@ us , one that wor@@ shi@@ pped God , whose house joined hard to the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
and Cris@@ p@@ us , the chief ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Cor@@ in@@ th@@ ians hearing believed , and were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
and when Gal@@ li@@ o was the deputy of A@@ cha@@ ia , the Jews made insur@@ rec@@ tion with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
then all the Greeks took S@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , the chief ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and Gal@@ li@@ o car@@ ed for none of those things .
but b@@ ade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that co@@ me@@ th in Jer@@ usalem : but I will return again un@@ to you , if God will . and he sa@@ iled from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
and after he had spent some time there , he depar@@ ted , and went over all the country of Gal@@ ati@@ a and Ph@@ ry@@ g@@ ia in order , strengthening all the dis@@ cip@@ les .
this man was instruc@@ ted in the way of the Lord ; and being fer@@ v@@ ent in the spirit , he sp@@ ake and ta@@ ught dil@@ ig@@ ently the things of the Lord , kno@@ wing only the b@@ ap@@ tism of John .
and he began to speak bol@@ dly in the syn@@ ago@@ gue : whom when A@@ qu@@ ila and P@@ ris@@ cil@@ la had heard , they took him un@@ to them , and ex@@ po@@ unded un@@ to him the way of God more perf@@ ec@@ tly .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which d@@ wel@@ t in Asia heard the word of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , both Jews and Greeks .
many of them also which used cur@@ ious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fif@@ ty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul pur@@ posed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , to go to Jer@@ usalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that minist@@ ered un@@ to him , Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us and Er@@ as@@ tus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
and the whole city was filled with conf@@ usion : and having caught G@@ ai@@ us and Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , men of Macedonia , Paul 's compan@@ ions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent un@@ to him , desi@@ ring him that he would not ad@@ venture himself into the theatre .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore if Demetri@@ us , and the craf@@ ts@@ men which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them imple@@ ad one another .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's u@@ pro@@ ar , there being no cause where@@ by we may give an account of this con@@ course .
when he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and e@@ aten , and talked a long while , even ti@@ ll break of day , so he depar@@ ted .
and we sa@@ iled th@@ ence , and came the next day over against Chi@@ os ; and the next day we arrived at Sam@@ os , and tar@@ ried at Tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ um ; and the next day we came to Mil@@ et@@ us .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he has@@ ted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jer@@ usalem the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
and when they were come to him , he said un@@ to them , Y@@ e know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all se@@ as@@ ons ,
serving the Lord with all hum@@ il@@ ity of mind , and with many te@@ ars , and temp@@ tations , which be@@ fell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable un@@ to you , but have she@@ wed you , and have ta@@ ught you public@@ k@@ ly , and from house to house ,
and now , be@@ hold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone pre@@ aching the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , shall see my face no more .
for I know this , that after my depar@@ ting shall gri@@ ev@@ ous w@@ ol@@ ves enter in among you , not spar@@ ing the flock .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a stra@@ ight course un@@ to Co@@ os , and the day following un@@ to R@@ ho@@ des , and from th@@ ence un@@ to Pat@@ ara :
now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sa@@ iled into Syria , and lan@@ ded at T@@ y@@ re : for there the ship was to un@@ la@@ de her burden .
and when we had accomplished those days , we depar@@ ted and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wi@@ ves and children , ti@@ ll we were out of the city : and we k@@ ne@@ eled down on the shore , and pray@@ ed .
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company depar@@ ted , and came un@@ to Ca@@ es@@ area : and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , which was one of the seven ; and abo@@ de with him .
and when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , bes@@ ought him not to go up to Jer@@ usalem .
there went with us also certain of the dis@@ cip@@ les of Ca@@ es@@ area , and brought with them one M@@ n@@ ason of Cyprus , an old dis@@ cip@@ le , with whom we should lo@@ dge .
and when they heard it , they gl@@ ori@@ fied the Lord , and said un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u se@@ est , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are which believe ; and they are all z@@ e@@ al@@ ous of the law :
what is it therefore ? the multi@@ tude must needs come together : for they will hear that th@@ ou art come .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temp@@ le , s@@ tir@@ red up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
and all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temp@@ le : and for@@ th@@ with the doors were shut .
and as they went about to kill him , ti@@ dings came un@@ to the chief captain of the band , that all Jer@@ usalem was in an u@@ pro@@ ar .
who immediately took soldiers and centur@@ ions , and ran down un@@ to them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
and some cri@@ ed one thing , some another , among the multi@@ tude : and when he could not know the certain@@ ty for the t@@ um@@ ult , he comman@@ ded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the st@@ airs , so it was , that he was bor@@ ne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the st@@ airs , and bec@@ kon@@ ed with the hand un@@ to the people . and when there was made a great sil@@ ence , he sp@@ ake un@@ to them in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come n@@ igh un@@ to Dam@@ as@@ cus about noon , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ one from heav@@ en a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that sp@@ ake to me .
and when I could not see for the gl@@ ory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and when the blood of TH@@ Y m@@ art@@ y@@ r Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and con@@ sent@@ ing un@@ to his death , and kept the ra@@ im@@ ent of them that sle@@ w him .
and they gave him audience un@@ to this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , away with such a fellow from the ear@@ th : for it is not fit that he should live .
then stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay they depar@@ ted from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
and when he had so said , there ar@@ ose a dis@@ sen@@ sion between the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and the Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es : and the multi@@ tude was divided .
and when there ar@@ ose a great dis@@ sen@@ sion , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prison@@ er called me un@@ to him , and pray@@ ed me to bring this young man un@@ to the@@ e , who hat@@ h something to say un@@ to the@@ e .
so the chief captain then let the young man de@@ part , and charged him , Se@@ e th@@ ou tell no man that th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed these things to me .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and res@@ cu@@ ed him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay to the@@ e , and gave comman@@ d@@ ment to his acc@@ users also to say before the@@ e what they had against him . farewell .
who , when they came to Ca@@ es@@ area , and delivered the ep@@ ist@@ le to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , that I be not further te@@ di@@ ous un@@ to the@@ e , I pra@@ y the@@ e that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest hear us of TH@@ Y cle@@ men@@ cy a few words .
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to him to speak , answ@@ ered , For@@ as@@ much as I know that th@@ ou h@@ ast been of many years a judge un@@ to this nation , I do the more che@@ er@@ fully answer for myself :
or else let these same here say , if they have found any ev@@ il doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
and when F@@ eli@@ x heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he def@@ er@@ red them , and said , When Ly@@ si@@ as the chief captain shall come down , I will know the ut@@ ter@@ most of your matter .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : where@@ fore he sent for him the of@@ ten@@ er , and commun@@ ed with him .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jer@@ usalem stood round about , and laid many and gri@@ ev@@ ous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
therefore , when they were come hi@@ ther , without any delay on the mor@@ row I sat on the judgment seat , and comman@@ ded the man to be brought forth .
and on the mor@@ row , when Agri@@ p@@ pa was come , and Bern@@ ice , with great pom@@ p , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief cap@@ tains , and principal men of the city , at F@@ es@@ tus ' comman@@ d@@ ment Paul was brought forth .
which thing I also did in Jer@@ usalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at mid@@ day , O king , I saw in the way a light from heav@@ en , above the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the sun , sh@@ ining round about me and them which jour@@ ne@@ yed with me .
and when we were all fallen to the ear@@ th , I heard a voice speaking un@@ to me , and saying in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue , Sa@@ ul , Sa@@ ul , why persec@@ u@@ test th@@ ou me ? it is hard for the@@ e to kick against the pri@@ cks .
but rise , and stand upon TH@@ Y feet : for I have appeared un@@ to the@@ e for this purpose , to make the@@ e a minister and a witness both of these things which th@@ ou h@@ ast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear un@@ to the@@ e ;
but she@@ wed first un@@ to them of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and at Jer@@ usalem , and throughout all the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and then to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that they should rep@@ ent and turn to God , and do works meet for rep@@ ent@@ ance .
for the king know@@ eth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persu@@ aded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a cor@@ ner .
and when it was determined that we should sa@@ il into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners un@@ to one named Jul@@ i@@ us , a centur@@ ion of Aug@@ ust@@ us ' band .
and entering into a ship of Ad@@ ram@@ y@@ tti@@ um , we launched , meaning to sa@@ il by the co@@ asts of Asia ; one Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thessalon@@ ica , being with us .
and when we had sa@@ iled over the sea of Cil@@ ic@@ ia and P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , we came to My@@ ra , a city of Ly@@ cia .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small temp@@ est lay on us , all hope that we should be sav@@ ed was then taken away .
but after long abst@@ in@@ ence Paul stood forth in the mid@@ st of them , and said , Sir@@ s , ye should have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to me , and not have lo@@ os@@ ed from Cre@@ te , and to have gained this harm and loss .
and now I ex@@ h@@ ort you to be of good che@@ er : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the ship@@ men deemed that they drew near to some country ;
and as the ship@@ men were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under col@@ our as though they would have cast an@@ ch@@ ors out of the fo@@ res@@ hip ,
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
and when they had e@@ aten enough , they ligh@@ tened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain cre@@ ek with a shore , into the which they were min@@ ded , if it were possible , to th@@ rust in the ship .
and when they had taken up the an@@ ch@@ ors , they committed themselves un@@ to the sea , and lo@@ os@@ ed the ru@@ d@@ der bands , and ho@@ ised up the main@@ sa@@ il to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship ag@@ round ; and the fore@@ part st@@ uck fast , and remained un@@ mov@@ eable , but the hin@@ der part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and the bar@@ bar@@ ous people she@@ wed us no little kin@@ d@@ ness : for they kin@@ d@@ led a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bun@@ dle of sti@@ cks , and laid them on the fire , there came a vi@@ per out of the heat , and fas@@ tened on his hand .
and when the bar@@ bar@@ ians saw the ven@@ om@@ ous be@@ ast han@@ g on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a mur@@ der@@ er , whom , though he hat@@ h escaped the sea , yet ven@@ ge@@ ance suffer@@ eth not to live .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay si@@ ck of a f@@ ever and of a blo@@ ody f@@ lu@@ x : to whom Paul entered in , and pray@@ ed , and laid his hands on him , and he@@ aled him .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were he@@ aled :
and from th@@ ence we f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass , and came to R@@ he@@ gi@@ um : and after one day the south wind ble@@ w , and we came the next day to Pu@@ te@@ ol@@ i :
and from th@@ ence , when the bre@@ th@@ ren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Ap@@ pi@@ i@@ forum , and The three ta@@ ver@@ ns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to d@@ well by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
for the heart of this people is wa@@ xed gross , and their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and understand with their heart , and should be conver@@ ted , and I should he@@ al them .
I am deb@@ tor both to the Greeks , and to the bar@@ bar@@ ians ; both to the wise , and to the un@@ wise .
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist : for it is the power of God un@@ to sal@@ vation to every one that believ@@ eth ; to the J@@ ew first , and also to the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eter@@ nal power and God@@ head ; so that they are without exc@@ use :
because that , when they knew God , they gl@@ ori@@ fied him not as God , neither were than@@ k@@ ful ; but became v@@ ain in their imag@@ inations , and their fo@@ ol@@ ish heart was dar@@ ken@@ ed .
and changed the gl@@ ory of the un@@ cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble God into an image made like to cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble man , and to birds , and fo@@ ur@@ fo@@ oted be@@ asts , and cre@@ eping things .
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not conven@@ i@@ ent ;
B@@ ack@@ bi@@ ters , hat@@ ers of God , desp@@ ite@@ ful , proud , bo@@ asters , invent@@ ors of ev@@ il things , dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent to parents ,
who kno@@ wing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are wor@@ thy of death , not only do the same , but have pleas@@ ure in them that do them .
but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thin@@ k@@ est th@@ ou this , O man , that jud@@ gest them which do such things , and do@@ est the same , that th@@ ou s@@ halt escape the judgment of God ?
for as many as have sin@@ ned without law shall also per@@ ish without law : and as many as have sin@@ ned in the law shall be jud@@ ged by the law ;
( for not the hear@@ ers of the law are just before God , but the do@@ ers of the law shall be justified .
for when the Gen@@ ti@@ les , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law un@@ to themselves :
now we know that what things so@@ ever the law sa@@ ith , it sa@@ ith to them who are under the law : that every m@@ outh may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
and the father of circum@@ c@@ ision to them who are not of the circum@@ c@@ ision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which he had being yet un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised .
for the promise , that he should be the he@@ ir of the world , was not to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , or to his se@@ ed , through the law , but through the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of faith .
for if they which are of the law be he@@ ir@@ s , faith is made vo@@ id , and the promise made of none effect :
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ a 's w@@ om@@ b :
now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imp@@ uted to him ;
and hope mak@@ eth not as@@ ha@@ med ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hear@@ ts by the Holy gh@@ ost which is given un@@ to us .
for if , when we were enem@@ ies , we were reconc@@ iled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconc@@ iled , we shall be sav@@ ed by his life .
nevertheless death re@@ ig@@ ned from A@@ dam to Mos@@ es , even over them that had not sin@@ ned after the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of A@@ dam 's trans@@ gres@@ sion , who is the figure of him that was to come .
therefore as by the off@@ ence of one judgment came upon all men to condem@@ nation ; even so by the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of one the free gift came upon all men un@@ to justi@@ fication of life .
therefore we are buried with him by b@@ ap@@ tism into death : that like as Ch@@ r@@ ist was raised up from the dead by the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to sin : but yield yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness un@@ to God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obe@@ yed from the heart that form of doc@@ tr@@ ine which was delivered you .
know ye not , bre@@ th@@ ren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hat@@ h domin@@ ion over a man as long as he li@@ vet@@ h ?
for the woman which hat@@ h an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he li@@ vet@@ h ; but if the husband be dead , she is lo@@ os@@ ed from the law of her husband .
for that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I h@@ ate , that do I@@ .
for I know that in me ( that is , in my f@@ les@@ h , ) d@@ wel@@ le@@ th no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
for the good that I would I do not : but the ev@@ il which I would not , that I do .
now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in me .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to them which are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who walk not after the f@@ les@@ h , but after the Spiri@@ t .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the f@@ les@@ h , God sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of s@@ inf@@ ul f@@ les@@ h , and for sin , condemned sin in the f@@ les@@ h :
for they that are after the f@@ les@@ h do mind the things of the f@@ les@@ h ; but they that are after the Spiri@@ t the things of the Spiri@@ t .
but ye are not in the f@@ les@@ h , but in the Spiri@@ t , if so be that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ well in you . now if any man have not the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is none of his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him that raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ well in you , he that raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist from the dead shall also quic@@ ken your mort@@ al bodies by his Spiri@@ t that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in you .
for if ye live after the f@@ les@@ h , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spiri@@ t do mor@@ ti@@ fy the de@@ eds of the body , ye shall live .
for as many as are led by the Spiri@@ t of God , they are the sons of God .
and if children , then he@@ ir@@ s ; he@@ ir@@ s of God , and joint @@@ -@@ @ he@@ ir@@ s with Ch@@ r@@ ist ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also gl@@ ori@@ fied together .
for I rec@@ k@@ on that the suffer@@ ings of this present time are not wor@@ thy to be compared with the gl@@ ory which shall be revealed in us .
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of the Spiri@@ t , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to w@@ it , the re@@ dem@@ ption of our body .
for we are sav@@ ed by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man se@@ eth , why do@@ th he yet hope for ?
but if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
moreover whom he did pre@@ dest@@ in@@ ate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also gl@@ ori@@ fied .
who is he that condem@@ net@@ h ? it is Ch@@ r@@ ist that died , ye@@ a rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for us .
that is , They which are the children of the f@@ les@@ h , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the se@@ ed .
for he sa@@ ith to Mos@@ es , I will have mer@@ cy on whom I will have mer@@ cy , and I will have comp@@ as@@ sion on whom I will have comp@@ as@@ sion .
for the s@@ crip@@ ture sa@@ ith un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , E@@ ven for this same purpose have I raised the@@ e up , that I might she@@ w my power in the@@ e , and that my name might be declared throughout all the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God .
for he will finish the work , and cut it short in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the ear@@ th .
what shall we say then ? that the Gen@@ ti@@ les , which followed not after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , have at@@ tained to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , even the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness which is of faith .
for they being ignor@@ ant of God 's righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and going about to establish their own righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , have not submitted themselves un@@ to the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of God .
that if th@@ ou s@@ halt conf@@ ess with TH@@ Y m@@ outh the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and s@@ halt believe in th@@ ine heart that God hat@@ h raised him from the dead , th@@ ou s@@ halt be sav@@ ed .
for there is no difference between the J@@ ew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich un@@ to all that call upon him .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a pre@@ acher ?
and how shall they pre@@ ach , except they be sent ? as it is written , Ho@@ w beautiful are the feet of them that pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of peace , and bring glad ti@@ dings of good things !
but E@@ sa@@ ias is very b@@ old , and sa@@ ith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manif@@ est un@@ to them that asked not after me .
but what sa@@ ith the answer of God un@@ to him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bo@@ wed the k@@ ne@@ e to the image of Ba@@ al .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
now if the fall of them be the ri@@ ches of the world , and the dimin@@ ishing of them the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les ; how much more their ful@@ ness ?
if by any means I may prov@@ oke to em@@ ulation them which are my f@@ les@@ h , and might save some of them .
for if the casting away of them be the reconc@@ iling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
for if th@@ ou w@@ ert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and w@@ ert gra@@ ff@@ ed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be gra@@ ff@@ ed into their own olive tree ?
for I would not , bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye should be ignor@@ ant of this my@@ ster@@ y , lest ye should be wise in your own conce@@ its ; that b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness in part is happened to Israel , until the ful@@ ness of the Gen@@ ti@@ les be come in .
and be not con@@ formed to this world : but be ye transformed by the rene@@ wing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
be of the same mind one toward another . mind not high things , but con@@ des@@ cen@@ d to men of low estate . be not wise in your own conce@@ its .
therefore if th@@ ine enemy hunger , fe@@ ed him ; if he thir@@ st , give him drink : for in so doing th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ ap co@@ als of fire on his head .
for rul@@ ers are not a terror to good works , but to the ev@@ il . Wil@@ t th@@ ou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and th@@ ou s@@ halt have praise of the same :
the night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of d@@ ark@@ ness , and let us put on the arm@@ our of light .
but put ye on the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make not provision for the f@@ les@@ h , to fulfil the lu@@ sts there@@ of .
he that regar@@ de@@ th the day , regar@@ de@@ th it un@@ to the Lord ; and he that regar@@ de@@ th not the day , to the Lord he do@@ th not regard it . he that e@@ ate@@ th , e@@ ate@@ th to the Lord , for he gi@@ vet@@ h God thanks ; and he that e@@ ate@@ th not , to the Lord he e@@ ate@@ th not , and gi@@ vet@@ h God thanks .
for whether we live , we live un@@ to the Lord ; and whether we die , we die un@@ to the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Ch@@ r@@ ist both died , and rose , and revi@@ ved , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
but why dost th@@ ou judge TH@@ Y brother ? or why dost th@@ ou set at n@@ ought TH@@ Y brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
I know , and am persu@@ aded by the Lord J@@ es@@ us , that there is nothing un@@ clean of itself : but to him that es@@ te@@ eme@@ th any thing to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
it is good neither to eat f@@ les@@ h , nor to drink wine , nor any thing where@@ by TH@@ Y brother stumb@@ le@@ th , or is off@@ ended , or is made weak .
nevertheless , bre@@ th@@ ren , I have written the more bol@@ dly un@@ to you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
it hat@@ h pleased them veril@@ y ; and their deb@@ tors they are . for if the Gen@@ ti@@ les have been made par@@ tak@@ ers of their spir@@ itual things , their duty is also to minister un@@ to them in car@@ nal things .
and I am sure that , when I come un@@ to you , I shall come in the ful@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , for the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake , and for the love of the Spiri@@ t , that ye strive together with me in your pray@@ ers to God for me ;
that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Ju@@ da@@ ea ; and that my service which I have for Jer@@ usalem may be accepted of the sa@@ ints ;
that ye receive her in the Lord , as bec@@ o@@ me@@ th sa@@ ints , and that ye assist her in wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever business she hat@@ h need of you : for she hat@@ h been a succ@@ ou@@ rer of many , and of myself also .
sal@@ ute Phil@@ olo@@ gu@@ s , and Jul@@ ia , Ner@@ e@@ us , and his sister , and Olymp@@ as , and all the sa@@ ints which are with them .
for they that are such serve not our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but their own bel@@ ly ; and by good words and fair spe@@ eches dec@@ e@@ ive the hear@@ ts of the simple .
for your obe@@ di@@ ence is come abroad un@@ to all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise un@@ to that which is good , and simple concerning ev@@ il .
but now is made manif@@ est , and by the s@@ crip@@ tures of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the ever@@ lasting God , made known to all nations for the obe@@ di@@ ence of faith :
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , by the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perf@@ ec@@ tly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it hat@@ h been declared un@@ to me of you , my bre@@ th@@ ren , by them which are of the house of Ch@@ lo@@ e , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
for Ch@@ r@@ ist sent me not to b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze , but to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el : not with wis@@ dom of words , lest the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist should be made of none effect .
for the pre@@ aching of the cross is to them that per@@ ish fo@@ ol@@ ishness ; but un@@ to us which are sav@@ ed it is the power of God .
but God hat@@ h chosen the fo@@ ol@@ ish things of the world to con@@ found the wise ; and God hat@@ h chosen the weak things of the world to con@@ found the things which are m@@ igh@@ ty ;
and base things of the world , and things which are desp@@ ised , hat@@ h God chosen , ye@@ a , and things which are not , to bring to n@@ ought things that are :
and I , bre@@ th@@ ren , when I came to you , came not with exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of speech or of wis@@ dom , declaring un@@ to you the testimony of God .
for what man know@@ eth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God know@@ eth no man , but the Spiri@@ t of God .
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
but the natural man recei@@ vet@@ h not the things of the Spiri@@ t of God : for they are fo@@ ol@@ ishness un@@ to him : neither can he know them , because they are spir@@ itu@@ ally dis@@ cer@@ ned .
now he that plan@@ te@@ th and he that water@@ eth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
according to the grace of God which is given un@@ to me , as a wise mas@@ ter@@ buil@@ der , I have laid the foundation , and another buil@@ de@@ th there@@ on . but let every man take heed how he buil@@ de@@ th there@@ upon .
every man 's work shall be made manif@@ est : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
if any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be sav@@ ed ; yet so as by fire .
whether Paul , or A@@ pol@@ los , or C@@ ep@@ has , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yo@@ urs ;
let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and ste@@ wards of the my@@ ster@@ ies of God .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged of you , or of man 's judgment : ye@@ a , I judge not mine own self .
for who mak@@ eth the@@ e to differ from another ? and what h@@ ast th@@ ou that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not receive ? now if th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st receive it , why dost th@@ ou gl@@ ory , as if th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st not received it ?
now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have re@@ ig@@ ned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are pu@@ ff@@ ed up , but the power .
it is reported com@@ mon@@ ly that there is for@@ nic@@ ation among you , and such for@@ nic@@ ation as is not so much as named among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that one should have his father 's wife .
and ye are pu@@ ff@@ ed up , and have not rather mour@@ ned , that he that hat@@ h done this de@@ ed might be taken away from among you .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old le@@ av@@ en , neither with the le@@ av@@ en of mal@@ ice and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ; but with the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread of sinc@@ erity and truth .
yet not altogether with the for@@ nic@@ ators of this world , or with the c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous , or ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers , or with i@@ do@@ la@@ ters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the sa@@ ints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be jud@@ ged by you , are ye un@@ wor@@ thy to judge the smal@@ lest matters ?
I speak to your sh@@ ame . is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his bre@@ th@@ ren ?
now therefore there is ut@@ ter@@ ly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yo@@ ur@@ selves to be def@@ ra@@ u@@ ded ?
and such were some of you : but ye are was@@ hed , but ye are sanc@@ ti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and by the Spiri@@ t of our God .
and God hat@@ h both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
know ye not that your bodies are the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? shall I then take the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make them the members of an har@@ lot ? God for@@ bid .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temp@@ le of the Holy gh@@ ost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
for ye are bought with a price : therefore g@@ lor@@ ify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's .
the wife hat@@ h not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hat@@ h not power of his own body , but the wife .
Def@@ ra@@ ud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yo@@ ur@@ selves to fas@@ ting and pray@@ er ; and come together again , that S@@ atan temp@@ t you not for your in@@ contin@@ ency .
for I would that all men were even as I myself . but every man hat@@ h his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
but and if she de@@ part , let her remain un@@ married , or be reconc@@ iled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hat@@ h a wife that believ@@ eth not , and she be pleased to d@@ well with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hat@@ h an husband that believ@@ eth not , and if he be pleased to d@@ well with her , let her not leave him .
but if the un@@ believ@@ ing de@@ part , let him de@@ part . a brother or a sister is not under bon@@ da@@ ge in such cases : but God hat@@ h called us to peace .
for what know@@ est th@@ ou , O wife , whether th@@ ou s@@ halt save TH@@ Y husband ? or how know@@ est th@@ ou , O man , whether th@@ ou s@@ halt save TH@@ Y wife ?
art th@@ ou called being a ser@@ vant ? care not for it : but if th@@ ou may@@ est be made free , use it rather .
for he that is called in the Lord , being a ser@@ vant , is the Lord 's Fre@@ eman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's ser@@ vant .
I sup@@ pose therefore that this is good for the present dist@@ ress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
art th@@ ou bound un@@ to a wife ? seek not to be lo@@ os@@ ed . art th@@ ou lo@@ os@@ ed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but I would have you without car@@ eful@@ ness . he that is un@@ married c@@ aret@@ h for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may ple@@ ase the Lord :
and this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a sn@@ are upon you , but for that which is co@@ mely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without dist@@ rac@@ tion .
but if any man think that he beha@@ vet@@ h himself un@@ co@@ mely toward his vir@@ gin , if she pass the f@@ lower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sin@@ net@@ h not : let them mar@@ ry .
nevertheless he that stan@@ de@@ th ste@@ d@@ fast in his heart , having no necess@@ ity , but hat@@ h power over his own will , and hat@@ h so decre@@ ed in his heart that he will keep his vir@@ gin , do@@ eth well .
so then he that gi@@ vet@@ h her in marriage do@@ eth well ; but he that gi@@ vet@@ h her not in marriage do@@ eth better .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband li@@ vet@@ h ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liber@@ ty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
but meat commen@@ de@@ th us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
if I be not an A@@ pos@@ tle un@@ to others , yet doub@@ t@@ less I am to you : for the se@@ al of mine ap@@ ost@@ le@@ ship are ye in the Lord .
who go@@ eth a war@@ fare any time at his own charges ? who plan@@ te@@ th a v@@ ine@@ yard , and e@@ ate@@ th not of the fruit there@@ of ? or who fe@@ ede@@ th a flock , and e@@ ate@@ th not of the milk of the flock ?
do ye not know that they which minister about hol@@ y things live of the things of the temp@@ le ? and they which wait at the al@@ ter are par@@ tak@@ ers with the al@@ ter ?
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done un@@ to me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my g@@ lor@@ ying vo@@ id .
what is my reward then ? Ver@@ ily that , when I pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , I may make the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , that I abuse not my power in the g@@ os@@ p@@ el .
and un@@ to the Jews I became as a J@@ ew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Ch@@ r@@ ist , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subj@@ ection : lest that by any means , when I have pre@@ ached to others , I myself should be a cas@@ ta@@ way .
moreover , bre@@ th@@ ren , I would not that ye should be ignor@@ ant , how that all our fa@@ thers were under the cl@@ oud , and all passed through the sea ;
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is it not the commun@@ ion of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is it not the commun@@ ion of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
but I say , that the things which the Gen@@ ti@@ les sacrifice , they sacrifice to dev@@ ils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fel@@ low@@ ship with dev@@ ils .
Y@@ e can@@ not drink the c@@ up of the Lord , and the c@@ up of dev@@ ils : ye can@@ not be par@@ tak@@ ers of the Lord 's table , and of the table of dev@@ ils .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be dis@@ posed to go ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is set before you , eat , asking no question for con@@ science sake .
but if any man say un@@ to you , This is offered in sacrifice un@@ to id@@ ols , eat not for his sake that she@@ wed it , and for con@@ science sake : for the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of :
for if I by grace be a par@@ tak@@ er , why am I ev@@ il spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
now I praise you , bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ord@@ inan@@ ces , as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know , that the head of every man is Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Ch@@ r@@ ist is God .
for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shor@@ n : but if it be a sh@@ ame for a woman to be shor@@ n or sha@@ ven , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , for@@ as@@ much as he is the image and gl@@ ory of God : but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
now in this that I declare un@@ to you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
when ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's Sup@@ per .
after the same manner also he took the c@@ up , when he had sup@@ ped , saying , This c@@ up is the new test@@ am@@ ent in my blood : this do ye , as of@@ t as ye drink it , in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of me .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that c@@ up .
but when we are jud@@ ged , we are ch@@ as@@ tened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together un@@ to condem@@ nation . and the rest will I set in order when I come .
for as the body is one , and hat@@ h many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and those members of the body , which we think to be less honour@@ able , upon these we bes@@ to@@ w more ab@@ und@@ ant honour ; and our un@@ co@@ mely parts have more ab@@ und@@ ant co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess .
and though I have the gift of pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and understand all my@@ ster@@ ies , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
charity never fail@@ eth : but whether there be pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ ies , they shall fail ; whether there be ton@@ gues , they shall ce@@ ase ; whether there be knowledge , it shall van@@ ish away .
when I was a child , I sp@@ ake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
for he that speak@@ eth in an unknown ton@@ gue speak@@ eth not un@@ to men , but un@@ to God : for no man under@@ stan@@ de@@ th him ; ho@@ w@@ be@@ it in the spirit he speak@@ eth my@@ ster@@ ies .
I would that ye all sp@@ ake with ton@@ gues , but rather that ye pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied : for greater is he that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth than he that speak@@ eth with ton@@ gues , except he interpre@@ t , that the church may receive edi@@ fying .
now , bre@@ th@@ ren , if I come un@@ to you speaking with ton@@ gues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by reve@@ lation , or by knowledge , or by pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying , or by doc@@ tr@@ ine ?
so likewise ye , except ye ut@@ ter by the ton@@ gue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signific@@ ation .
therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be un@@ to him that speak@@ eth a bar@@ bar@@ ian , and he that speak@@ eth shall be a bar@@ bar@@ ian un@@ to me .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
else when th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ less with the spirit , how shall he that occup@@ i@@ eth the room of the un@@ learned say A@@ men at TH@@ Y giving of thanks , seeing he under@@ stan@@ de@@ th not what th@@ ou say@@ est ?
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might te@@ ach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown ton@@ gue .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ton@@ gues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying ser@@ vet@@ h not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
and thus are the secre@@ ts of his heart made manif@@ est ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
if any man speak in an unknown ton@@ gue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpre@@ t .
let your women keep sil@@ ence in the churches : for it is not per@@ mitted un@@ to them to speak ; but they are comman@@ ded to be under obe@@ di@@ ence , as also sa@@ ith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their hus@@ bands at home : for it is a sh@@ ame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write un@@ to you are the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord .
after that , he was seen of above five hundred bre@@ th@@ ren at once ; of whom the greater part remain un@@ to this present , but some are fallen as@@ le@@ ep .
for I am the least of the A@@ post@@ les , that am not meet to be called an A@@ pos@@ tle , because I persec@@ uted the church of God .
now if Ch@@ r@@ ist be pre@@ ached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead ?
and if Ch@@ r@@ ist be not risen , then is our pre@@ aching v@@ ain , and your faith is also v@@ ain .
Ye@@ a , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
then co@@ me@@ th the end , when he shall have delivered up the k@@ ing@@ dom to God , even the F@@ ather ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
and that which th@@ ou so@@ west , th@@ ou so@@ west not that body that shall be , but b@@ are gra@@ in , it may chance of wheat , or of some other gra@@ in :
there are also cele@@ sti@@ al bodies , and bodies ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al : but the gl@@ ory of the cele@@ sti@@ al is one , and the gl@@ ory of the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al is another .
there is one gl@@ ory of the sun , and another gl@@ ory of the moon , and another gl@@ ory of the stars : for one star differ@@ eth from another star in gl@@ ory .
so when this cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble shall have put on incor@@ ruption , and this mort@@ al shall have put on im@@ mortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , De@@ ath is sw@@ allowed up in victory .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hat@@ h prosp@@ ered him , that there be no gather@@ ings when I come .
let no man therefore desp@@ ise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come un@@ to me : for I look for him with the bre@@ th@@ ren .
as tou@@ ching our brother A@@ pol@@ los , I greatly desi@@ red him to come un@@ to you with the bre@@ th@@ ren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have conven@@ i@@ ent time .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist by the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , un@@ to the church of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints which are in all A@@ cha@@ ia :
who comfor@@ te@@ th us in all our tri@@ bu@@ lation , that we may be able to comfor@@ t them which are in any trouble , by the comfor@@ t where@@ with we ourselves are comfor@@ ted of God .
and whether we be aff@@ lic@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation , which is effec@@ tual in the en@@ during of the same suffer@@ ings which we also suffer : or whether we be comfor@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation .
and our hope of you is ste@@ d@@ fast , kno@@ wing , that as ye are par@@ tak@@ ers of the suffer@@ ings , so shall ye be also of the con@@ so@@ lation .
for we would not , bre@@ th@@ ren , have you ignor@@ ant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that we desp@@ aired even of life :
moreover I call God for a record upon my sou@@ l , that to spar@@ e you I came not as yet un@@ to Cor@@ inth .
for if I make you sor@@ ry , who is he then that mak@@ eth me glad , but the same which is made sor@@ ry by me ?
and I wrote this same un@@ to you , lest , when I came , I should have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
for out of much aff@@ li@@ ction and an@@ gu@@ ish of heart I wrote un@@ to you with many te@@ ars ; not that ye should be gri@@ ev@@ ed , but that ye might know the love which I have more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly un@@ to you .
so that contr@@ ar@@ i@@ wise ye ought rather to for@@ give him , and comfor@@ t him , lest perhaps such a one should be sw@@ allowed up with over@@ much sor@@ row .
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obe@@ di@@ ent in all things .
to whom ye for@@ give any thing , I for@@ give also : for if I for@@ gave any thing , to whom I for@@ gave it , for your sak@@ es for@@ gave I it in the person of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
to the one we are the sav@@ our of death un@@ to death ; and to the other the sav@@ our of life un@@ to life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
For@@ as@@ much as ye are manif@@ est@@ ly declared to be the ep@@ ist@@ le of Ch@@ r@@ ist minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fle@@ sh@@ y tables of the heart .
and not as Mos@@ es , which put a v@@ ail over his face , that the children of Israel could not ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly look to the end of that which is abolished :
but have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of dis@@ hon@@ es@@ ty , not walk@@ ing in craf@@ tin@@ ess , nor handling the word of God dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; but by manif@@ est@@ ation of the truth commen@@ ding ourselves to every man 's con@@ science in the sight of God .
in whom the go@@ d of this world hat@@ h b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of them which believe not , lest the light of the g@@ lor@@ ious g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should sh@@ ine un@@ to them .
always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , that the life also of J@@ es@@ us might be made manif@@ est in our body .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al ; but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for in this we gro@@ an , ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly desi@@ ring to be clo@@ th@@ ed upon with our house which is from heav@@ en :
we are confident , I say , and willing rather to be ab@@ sent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hat@@ h done , whether it be good or bad .
for we commen@@ d not ourselves again un@@ to you , but give you occasion to gl@@ ory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which gl@@ ory in appearance , and not in heart .
therefore if any man be in Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is a new cre@@ ature : old things are passed away ; be@@ hold , all things are become new .
to w@@ it , that God was in Ch@@ r@@ ist , reconc@@ iling the world un@@ to himself , not imp@@ ut@@ ing their t@@ res@@ passes un@@ to them ; and hat@@ h committed un@@ to us the word of reconciliation .
now then we are ambassadors for Ch@@ r@@ ist , as though God did bes@@ e@@ ech you by us : we pra@@ y you in Ch@@ r@@ ist 's stead , be ye reconc@@ iled to God .
( for he sa@@ ith , I have heard the@@ e in a time accepted , and in the day of sal@@ vation have I succ@@ oured the@@ e : be@@ hold , now is the accepted time ; be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation . )
great is my bol@@ d@@ ness of speech toward you , great is my g@@ lor@@ ying of you : I am filled with comfor@@ t , I am exceeding jo@@ y@@ ful in all our tri@@ bu@@ lation .
for , when we were come into Macedonia , our f@@ les@@ h had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were figh@@ t@@ ings , within were fears .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , though I wrote un@@ to you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear un@@ to you .
for if I have bo@@ asted any thing to him of you , I am not as@@ ha@@ med ; but as we sp@@ ake all things to you in truth , even so our bo@@ asting , which I made before Tit@@ us , is found a truth .
pray@@ ing us with much in@@ treaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fel@@ low@@ ship of the minist@@ ering to the sa@@ ints .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and un@@ to us by the will of God .
for ye know the grace of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that , though he was rich , yet for your sak@@ es he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
and her@@ e@@ in I give my advice : for this is expedi@@ ent for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
for if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hat@@ h , and not according to that he hat@@ h not .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have of@@ ten@@ times proved dil@@ ig@@ ent in many things , but now much more dil@@ ig@@ ent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
whether any do inqu@@ ire of Tit@@ us , he is my partner and fel@@ lo@@ whel@@ per concerning you : or our bre@@ th@@ ren be inqu@@ ired of , they are the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the churches , and the gl@@ ory of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she@@ w ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our bo@@ asting on your behalf .
yet have I sent the bre@@ th@@ ren , lest our bo@@ asting of you should be in v@@ ain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
but this I say , He which so@@ w@@ eth spar@@ ingly shall re@@ ap also spar@@ ingly ; and he which so@@ w@@ eth boun@@ ti@@ fully shall re@@ ap also boun@@ ti@@ fully .
now he that minist@@ er@@ eth se@@ ed to the so@@ wer both minister bread for your food , and multi@@ ply your se@@ ed so@@ wn , and increase the fru@@ its of your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; )
do ye look on things after the ou@@ tw@@ ard appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , even so are we Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
for though I should bo@@ ast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hat@@ h given us for edi@@ fication , and not for your destruction , I should not be as@@ ha@@ med :
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are ab@@ sent , such will we be also in de@@ ed when we are present .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compar@@ e ourselves with some that commen@@ d themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and compar@@ ing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not un@@ to you : for we are come as far as to you also in pre@@ aching the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
not bo@@ asting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's la@@ bour@@ s ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be en@@ lar@@ ged by you according to our rule ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly ,
to pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el in the regions beyond you , and not to bo@@ ast in another man 's line of things made ready to our hand .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the ser@@ p@@ ent be@@ gu@@ iled Eve through his sub@@ til@@ ty , so your min@@ ds should be cor@@ rupted from the simp@@ lic@@ ity that is in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
have I committed an off@@ ence in ab@@ asing myself that ye might be ex@@ al@@ ted , because I have pre@@ ached to you the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God freely ?
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that where@@ in they gl@@ ory , they may be found even as we .
for ye suffer , if a man bring you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if a man dev@@ our you , if a man take of you , if a man ex@@ alt himself , if a man sm@@ ite you on the face .
in jour@@ ne@@ y@@ ings often , in per@@ ils of waters , in per@@ ils of rob@@ bers , in per@@ ils by mine own country@@ men , in per@@ ils by the he@@ a@@ then , in per@@ ils in the city , in per@@ ils in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in per@@ ils in the sea , in per@@ ils among false bre@@ th@@ ren ;
in Dam@@ as@@ cus the governor under A@@ ret@@ as the king kept the city of the Dam@@ as@@ cen@@ es with a gar@@ ris@@ on , desi@@ ro@@ us to apprehend me :
for though I would desire to gl@@ ory , I shall not be a fo@@ ol ; for I will say the truth : but now I for@@ bear , lest any man should think of me above that which he se@@ eth me to be , or that he he@@ aret@@ h of me .
and lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure through the ab@@ und@@ ance of the reve@@ lations , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , the mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to bu@@ ff@@ et me , lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure .
and he said un@@ to me , My grace is sufficient for the@@ e : for my strength is made perfect in weak@@ ness . most gla@@ dly therefore will I rather gl@@ ory in my in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities , that the power of Ch@@ r@@ ist may rest upon me .
for what is it where@@ in ye were in@@ fer@@ ior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not bur@@ den@@ some to you ? for@@ give me this wrong .
for though he was cru@@ ci@@ fied through weak@@ ness , yet he li@@ vet@@ h by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
examine yo@@ ur@@ selves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is in you , except ye be re@@ prob@@ ates ?
for we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perf@@ ection .
but though we , or an an@@ gel from heav@@ en , pre@@ ach any other g@@ os@@ p@@ el un@@ to you than that which we have pre@@ ached un@@ to you , let him be accur@@ sed .
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persec@@ uted the church of God , and was@@ ted it :
but of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they were , it mak@@ eth no matter to me : God accep@@ te@@ th no man 's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
but if , while we seek to be justified by Ch@@ r@@ ist , we ourselves also are found sin@@ ners , is therefore Ch@@ r@@ ist the minister of sin ? God for@@ bid .
O fo@@ ol@@ ish Gal@@ ati@@ ans , who hat@@ h be@@ wit@@ ched you , that ye should not obe@@ y the truth , before whose eyes J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist hat@@ h been ev@@ id@@ ently set forth , cru@@ ci@@ fied among you ?
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the cur@@ se : for it is written , Cur@@ sed is every one that continu@@ eth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
and this I say , that the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , that was confirmed before of God in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , can@@ not dis@@ annul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God for@@ bid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , veril@@ y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness should have been by the law .
now I say , That the he@@ ir , as long as he is a child , differ@@ eth nothing from a ser@@ vant , though he be lor@@ d of all ;
where is then the b@@ les@@ s@@ edn@@ ess ye sp@@ ake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have p@@ lu@@ cked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
Ch@@ r@@ ist is become of no effect un@@ to you , wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise min@@ ded : but he that troub@@ le@@ th you shall bear his judgment , wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever he be .
for the f@@ les@@ h lus@@ te@@ th against the Spiri@@ t , and the Spiri@@ t against the f@@ les@@ h : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye can@@ not do the things that ye would .
for he that so@@ w@@ eth to his f@@ les@@ h shall of the f@@ les@@ h re@@ ap corruption ; but he that so@@ w@@ eth to the Spiri@@ t shall of the Spiri@@ t re@@ ap life ever@@ lasting .
and let us not be we@@ ary in well doing : for in due season we shall re@@ ap , if we fa@@ int not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good un@@ to all men , especially un@@ to them who are of the household of faith .
as many as desire to make a fair she@@ w in the f@@ les@@ h , they con@@ strain you to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; only lest they should suffer persec@@ ution for the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mer@@ cy , and upon the Israel of God .
according as he hat@@ h chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be hol@@ y and without blame before him in love :
that in the dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ation of the ful@@ ness of times he might gather together in one all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , both which are in heav@@ en , and which are on ear@@ th ; even in him :
in whom also we have obtained an inher@@ it@@ ance , being pre@@ dest@@ inated according to the purpose of him who wor@@ ket@@ h all things after the coun@@ sel of his own will :
in whom ye also tr@@ usted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of your sal@@ vation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that hol@@ y Spiri@@ t of promise ,
that at that time ye were without Ch@@ r@@ ist , being ali@@ ens from the com@@ mon@@ wealth of Israel , and st@@ ran@@ gers from the c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
which in other ages was not made known un@@ to the sons of men , as it is now revealed un@@ to his hol@@ y A@@ post@@ les and pro@@ ph@@ ets by the Spiri@@ t ;
W@@ her@@ e@@ of I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given un@@ to me by the effec@@ tual working of his power .
ti@@ ll we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , un@@ to a perfect man , un@@ to the measure of the stat@@ ure of the ful@@ ness of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
that we hen@@ ce@@ forth be no more children , tos@@ sed to and f@@ ro , and carried about with every wind of doc@@ tr@@ ine , by the sle@@ ight of men , and c@@ un@@ ning craf@@ tin@@ ess , where@@ by they lie in wait to dec@@ e@@ ive ;
from whom the whole body f@@ it@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint supp@@ li@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body un@@ to the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
having the understanding dar@@ ken@@ ed , being ali@@ en@@ ated from the life of God through the ignor@@ ance that is in them , because of the b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness of their heart :
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your m@@ outh , but that which is good to the use of edi@@ fying , that it may minister grace un@@ to the hear@@ ers .
but all things that are re@@ proved are made manif@@ est by the light : for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever do@@ th make manif@@ est is light .
for the husband is the head of the wife , even as Ch@@ r@@ ist is the head of the church : and he is the sa@@ vi@@ our of the body .
servants , be obe@@ di@@ ent to them that are your mas@@ ters according to the f@@ les@@ h , with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , in sing@@ len@@ ess of your heart , as un@@ to Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
put on the whole arm@@ our of God , that ye may be able to stand against the w@@ il@@ es of the dev@@ il .
for we wrest@@ le not against f@@ les@@ h and blood , but against princip@@ alities , against powers , against the rul@@ ers of the d@@ ark@@ ness of this world , against spir@@ itual w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in high places .
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , T@@ y@@ chic@@ us , a bel@@ ov@@ ed brother and fa@@ ith@@ ful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
whom I have sent un@@ to you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfor@@ t your hear@@ ts .
being confident of this very thing , that he which hat@@ h begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
but I would ye should understand , bre@@ th@@ ren , that the things which happened un@@ to me have fallen out rather un@@ to the further@@ ance of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el ;
for I know that this shall turn to my sal@@ vation through your pray@@ er , and the supply of the Spiri@@ t of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ,
but if I live in the f@@ les@@ h , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wo@@ t not .
but I trust in the Lord J@@ es@@ us to send Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us shortly un@@ to you , that I also may be of good comfor@@ t , when I know your state .
him therefore I hope to send present@@ ly , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
for he lon@@ ged after you all , and was full of heav@@ iness , because that ye had heard that he had been si@@ ck .
for indeed he was si@@ ck n@@ igh un@@ to death : but God had mer@@ cy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sor@@ row upon sor@@ row .
though I might also have confidence in the f@@ les@@ h . if any other man thin@@ ket@@ h that he hat@@ h where@@ of he might trust in the f@@ les@@ h , I more :
not as though I had already at@@ tained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
nevertheless , where@@ to we have already at@@ tained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even we@@ eping , that they are the enem@@ ies of the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
who shall change our v@@ ile body , that it may be fas@@ hi@@ oned like un@@ to his g@@ lor@@ ious body , according to the working where@@ by he is able even to sub@@ due all things un@@ to himself .
finally , bre@@ th@@ ren , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are true , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are honest , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are just , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are p@@ ure , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are lov@@ ely , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are of good report ; if there be any vir@@ tu@@ e , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
but I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hat@@ h flo@@ ur@@ ished again ; where@@ in ye were also careful , but ye la@@ cked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever state I am , there@@ with to be content .
since we heard of your faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , and of the love which ye have to all the sa@@ ints ,
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not ce@@ ase to pra@@ y for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wis@@ dom and spir@@ itual understanding ;
who hat@@ h delivered us from the power of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hat@@ h translated us into the k@@ ing@@ dom of his de@@ ar Son :
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconc@@ ile all things un@@ to himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in ear@@ th , or things in heav@@ en .
who now re@@ jo@@ ice in my suffer@@ ings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of Ch@@ r@@ ist in my f@@ les@@ h for his body 's sake , which is the church :
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at La@@ odi@@ cea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the f@@ les@@ h ;
for though I be ab@@ sent in the f@@ les@@ h , yet am I with you in the spirit , jo@@ ying and be@@ holding your order , and the ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ness of your faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
in whom also ye are circum@@ c@@ ised with the circum@@ c@@ ision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sin@@ s of the f@@ les@@ h by the circum@@ c@@ ision of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
buried with him in b@@ ap@@ tism , where@@ in also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
Blo@@ t@@ ting out the hand@@ writing of ord@@ inan@@ ces that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , n@@ ailing it to his cross ;
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an hol@@ y@@ day , or of the new moon , or of the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath days :
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ye do in word or de@@ ed , do all in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , giving thanks to God and the F@@ ather by him .
but he that do@@ eth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hat@@ h done : and there is no respect of persons .
for I bear him record , that he hat@@ h a great z@@ e@@ al for you , and them that are in La@@ odi@@ cea , and them in H@@ i@@ er@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
and when this ep@@ ist@@ le is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the La@@ odi@@ ce@@ ans ; and that ye likewise read the ep@@ ist@@ le from La@@ odi@@ cea .
Paul , and Sil@@ van@@ us , and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , un@@ to the church of the Thessalon@@ ians which is in God the F@@ ather and in the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist : grace be un@@ to you , and peace , from God our F@@ ather , and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for our g@@ os@@ p@@ el came not un@@ to you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy gh@@ ost , and in much assur@@ ance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
for from you so@@ unded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith to God @@@ -@@ @ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , even so we speak ; not as ple@@ asing men , but God , which tri@@ eth our hear@@ ts .
nor of men sought we gl@@ ory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been bur@@ den@@ some , as the A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
so being aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately desi@@ ro@@ us of you , we were willing to have im@@ par@@ ted un@@ to you , not the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God only , but also our own so@@ ul@@ s , because ye were de@@ ar un@@ to us .
for ye remember , bre@@ th@@ ren , our labour and trav@@ ail : for la@@ bour@@ ing night and day , because we would not be char@@ ge@@ able un@@ to any of you , we pre@@ ached un@@ to you the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God .
for what is our hope , or joy , or cro@@ wn of re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist at his coming ?
for veril@@ y , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tri@@ bu@@ lation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
but I would not have you to be ignor@@ ant , bre@@ th@@ ren , concerning them which are as@@ le@@ ep , that ye sor@@ row not , even as others which have no hope .
for this we say un@@ to you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain un@@ to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are as@@ le@@ ep .
for the Lord himself shall des@@ cen@@ d from heav@@ en with a sh@@ out , with the voice of the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , and with the tr@@ um@@ p of God : and the dead in Ch@@ r@@ ist shall rise first :
Y@@ e are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of d@@ ark@@ ness .
but let us , who are of the day , be so@@ ber , putting on the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of faith and love ; and for an hel@@ met , the hope of sal@@ vation .
we are bound to than@@ k God always for you , bre@@ th@@ ren , as it is meet , because that your faith grow@@ eth exce@@ ed@@ ingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other ab@@ oun@@ de@@ th ;
which is a manif@@ est to@@ ken of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God , that ye may be counted wor@@ thy of the k@@ ing@@ dom of God , for which ye also suffer :
let no man dec@@ e@@ ive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of per@@ di@@ tion ;
and then shall that W@@ ic@@ ked be revealed , whom the Lord shall consum@@ e with the spirit of his m@@ outh , and shall destroy with the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of his coming :
finally , bre@@ th@@ ren , pra@@ y for us , that the word of the Lord may have free course , and be gl@@ ori@@ fied , even as it is with you :
and we have confidence in the Lord tou@@ ching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
and the Lord direct your hear@@ ts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now we command you , bre@@ th@@ ren , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother that walk@@ eth dis@@ or@@ derly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for n@@ ought ; but w@@ rought with labour and trav@@ ail night and day , that we might not be char@@ ge@@ able to any of you :
and if any man obe@@ y not our word by this ep@@ ist@@ le , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be as@@ ha@@ med .
and I than@@ k Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us our Lord , who hat@@ h enabled me , for that he counted me fa@@ ith@@ ful , putting me into the ministry ;
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it for this cause I obtained mer@@ cy , that in me first J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist might she@@ w forth all long@@ suffering , for a pat@@ tern to them which should her@@ e@@ after believe on him to life ever@@ lasting .
W@@ her@@ e@@ un@@ to I am or@@ da@@ ined a pre@@ acher , and an A@@ pos@@ tle , ( I speak the truth in Ch@@ r@@ ist , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les in faith and ver@@ ity .
but I suffer not a woman to te@@ ach , nor to us@@ ur@@ p authority over the man , but to be in sil@@ ence .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
for they that have used the office of a de@@ ac@@ on well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great bol@@ d@@ ness in the faith which is in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
if th@@ ou put the bre@@ th@@ ren in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of these things , th@@ ou s@@ halt be a good minister of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , no@@ ur@@ ished up in the words of faith and of good doc@@ tr@@ ine , where@@ un@@ to th@@ ou h@@ ast at@@ tained .
for bo@@ dil@@ y exercise pro@@ fi@@ te@@ th little : but go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess is profitable un@@ to all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
let no man desp@@ ise TH@@ Y youth ; but be th@@ ou an example of the beli@@ ever@@ s , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in p@@ urity .
re@@ bu@@ ke not an el@@ der , but in@@ treat him as a father ; and the younger men as bre@@ th@@ ren ;
but if any provide not for his own , and spec@@ ially for those of his own house , he hat@@ h denied the faith , and is worse than an in@@ fi@@ del .
I charge the@@ e before God , and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and the elect an@@ gel@@ s , that th@@ ou observe these things without prefer@@ ring one before another , doing nothing by parti@@ ality .
I than@@ k God , whom I serve from my fore@@ fa@@ thers with p@@ ure con@@ science , that without ce@@ asing I have re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of the@@ e in my pray@@ ers night and day ;
when I call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the un@@ fe@@ ig@@ ned faith that is in the@@ e , which d@@ wel@@ t first in TH@@ Y grand@@ mother Lo@@ is , and TH@@ Y mother E@@ un@@ ice ; and I am persu@@ aded that in the@@ e also .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I put the@@ e in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance that th@@ ou stir up the gift of God , which is in the@@ e by the putting on of my hands .
be not th@@ ou therefore as@@ ha@@ med of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prison@@ er : but be th@@ ou par@@ tak@@ er of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el according to the power of God ;
and the things that th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit th@@ ou to fa@@ ith@@ ful men , who shall be able to te@@ ach others also .
no man that war@@ re@@ th ent@@ ang@@ le@@ th himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may ple@@ ase him who hat@@ h chosen him to be a soldier .
of these things put them in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the sub@@ ver@@ ting of the hear@@ ers .
tra@@ itors , head@@ y , high@@ min@@ ded , lov@@ ers of pleas@@ ures more than lov@@ ers of God ;
and they shall turn away their e@@ ars from the truth , and shall be turned un@@ to f@@ ables .
the clo@@ ke that I left at Tro@@ as with Car@@ p@@ us , when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st , bring with the@@ e , and the books , but especially the par@@ ch@@ ments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men for@@ so@@ ok me : I pra@@ y God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every ev@@ il work , and will preserve me un@@ to his heav@@ en@@ ly k@@ ing@@ dom : to whom be gl@@ ory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
to Tit@@ us , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mer@@ cy , and peace , from God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Sav@@ i@@ our .
for this cause left I the@@ e in Cre@@ te , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest set in order the things that are wan@@ ting , and or@@ da@@ in el@@ ders in every city , as I had appointed the@@ e :
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : al@@ be@@ it I do not say to the@@ e how th@@ ou ow@@ est un@@ to me even th@@ ine own self besides .
H@@ ath in these last days spoken un@@ to us by his Son , whom he hat@@ h appointed he@@ ir of all things , by whom also he made the wor@@ l@@ ds ;
therefore we ought to give the more ear@@ n@@ est heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them sli@@ p .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see J@@ es@@ us , who was made a little lower than the an@@ gel@@ s for the suffering of death , crow@@ ned with gl@@ ory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should tas@@ te death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons un@@ to gl@@ ory , to make the captain of their sal@@ vation perfect through suffer@@ ings .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore in all things it beh@@ ov@@ ed him to be made like un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that he might be a mer@@ ci@@ ful and fa@@ ith@@ ful high pri@@ est in things per@@ taining to God , to make reconciliation for the sin@@ s of the people .
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for un@@ to us was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached , as well as un@@ to them : but the word pre@@ ached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for we which have believed do enter into rest , as he said , As I have sworn in my wr@@ ath , if they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
for the word of God is quick , and powerful , and shar@@ per than any t@@ wo@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word , pi@@ er@@ cing even to the dividing as@@ under of sou@@ l and spirit , and of the join@@ ts and mar@@ row , and is a dis@@ cer@@ ner of the th@@ ou@@ ghts and inten@@ ts of the heart .
neither is there any cre@@ ature that is not manif@@ est in his sight : but all things are nak@@ ed and opened un@@ to the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
seeing then that we have a great high pri@@ est , that is passed into the heav@@ ens , J@@ es@@ us the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
for we have not an high pri@@ est which can@@ not be touched with the feeling of our in@@ fir@@ m@@ ities ; but was in all points temp@@ ted like as we are , yet without sin .
who can have comp@@ as@@ sion on the ignor@@ ant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is comp@@ ass@@ ed with in@@ fir@@ mity .
but strong meat belon@@ get@@ h to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their sen@@ ses exerc@@ ised to dis@@ cer@@ n both good and ev@@ il .
for the ear@@ th which drin@@ ket@@ h in the rain that co@@ me@@ th of@@ t upon it , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth her@@ bs meet for them by whom it is d@@ ressed , recei@@ vet@@ h b@@ les@@ sing from God :
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have she@@ wed toward his name , in that ye have minist@@ ered to the sa@@ ints , and do minister .
and veril@@ y they that are of the sons of L@@ evi , who receive the office of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , have a comman@@ d@@ ment to take ti@@ th@@ es of the people according to the law , that is , of their bre@@ th@@ ren , though they come out of the lo@@ ins of Ab@@ ra@@ ham :
( for those pri@@ ests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said un@@ to him , The Lord sw@@ are and will not rep@@ ent , T@@ ho@@ u art a pri@@ est for ever after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ is@@ ede@@ c : )
for finding fault with them , he sa@@ ith , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , when I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h :
for this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hear@@ ts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and they shall not te@@ ach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , K@@ now the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
for there was a tab@@ ern@@ acle made ; the first , where@@ in was the cand@@ le@@ stick , and the table , and the she@@ w@@ bread ; which is called the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
which had the golden cen@@ ser , and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant over@@ laid round about with gold , where@@ in was the golden po@@ t that had man@@ na , and Aaron 's ro@@ d that bud@@ ded , and the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
the Holy gh@@ ost this sig@@ ni@@ fying , that the way into the hol@@ iest of all was not yet made manif@@ est , while as the first tab@@ ern@@ acle was yet standing :
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as per@@ taining to the con@@ science ;
neither by the blood of go@@ ats and cal@@ ves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the hol@@ y place , having obtained eter@@ nal re@@ dem@@ ption for us .
for if the blood of bul@@ ls and of go@@ ats , and the ashes of an he@@ if@@ er sp@@ rin@@ k@@ ling the un@@ clean , sanc@@ ti@@ fi@@ eth to the pur@@ ifying of the f@@ les@@ h :
for when Mos@@ es had spoken every prec@@ ep@@ t to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of cal@@ ves and of go@@ ats , with water , and scar@@ let wo@@ ol , and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led both the book , and all the people ,
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es which they offered year by year continu@@ ally make the com@@ ers there@@ un@@ to perfect .
this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with them after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hear@@ ts , and in their min@@ ds will I write them ;
not for@@ sak@@ ing the assemb@@ ling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but ex@@ hor@@ ting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
for ye had comp@@ as@@ sion of me in my bonds , and took jo@@ y@@ fully the sp@@ o@@ iling of your goods , kno@@ wing in yo@@ ur@@ selves that ye have in heav@@ en a better and an en@@ during sub@@ stance .
but we are not of them who draw back un@@ to per@@ di@@ tion ; but of them that believe to the saving of the sou@@ l .
through faith we understand that the wor@@ l@@ ds were fra@@ med by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
but without faith it is impossible to ple@@ ase him : for he that co@@ me@@ th to God must believe that he is , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of them that dil@@ ig@@ ently seek him .
by faith Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance , obe@@ yed ; and he went out , not kno@@ wing w@@ hi@@ ther he went .
by faith he so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of promise , as in a st@@ range country , d@@ wel@@ ling in tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les with I@@ sa@@ ac and Jac@@ o@@ b , the he@@ ir@@ s with him of the same promise :
therefore sp@@ ran@@ g there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multi@@ tude , and as the s@@ and which is by the sea shore in@@ num@@ er@@ able .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them af@@ ar off , and were persu@@ aded of them , and embrac@@ ed them , and conf@@ essed that they were st@@ ran@@ gers and pil@@ gri@@ ms on the ear@@ th .
and truly , if they had been min@@ d@@ ful of that country from wh@@ ence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
by faith Jac@@ o@@ b , when he was a dying , b@@ les@@ sed both the sons of Joseph ; and wor@@ shi@@ pped , le@@ an@@ ing upon the top of his staff .
by faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the depar@@ ting of the children of Israel ; and gave comman@@ d@@ ment concerning his b@@ ones .
by faith Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hi@@ d three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
by faith Mos@@ es , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ;
by faith he for@@ so@@ ok Egypt , not fearing the wr@@ ath of the king : for he en@@ du@@ red , as seeing him who is in@@ visible .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of B@@ arak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ a@@ e ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the pro@@ ph@@ ets :
Qu@@ en@@ ched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the s@@ word , out of weak@@ ness were made strong , wa@@ xed val@@ i@@ ant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the ali@@ ens .
( of whom the world was not wor@@ thy : ) they w@@ and@@ ered in de@@ ser@@ ts , and in mountains , and in den@@ s and c@@ aves of the ear@@ th .
looking un@@ to J@@ es@@ us the author and fin@@ is@@ her of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising the sh@@ ame , and is set down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore lift up the hands which han@@ g down , and the fe@@ e@@ ble k@@ ne@@ es ;
( for they could not en@@ dur@@ e that which was comman@@ ded , An@@ d if so much as a be@@ ast touch the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned , or th@@ rust through with a d@@ art :
and this word , Y@@ et once more , sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ eth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which can@@ not be shaken may remain .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken un@@ to you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
be not carried about with di@@ vers and st@@ range doc@@ tr@@ ines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with me@@ ats , which have not pro@@ fi@@ ted them that have been occupied there@@ in .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord J@@ es@@ us , that great she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of the she@@ ep , through the blood of the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
if any of you lack wis@@ dom , let him ask of God , that gi@@ vet@@ h to all men liber@@ ally , and up@@ bra@@ ide@@ th not ; and it shall be given him .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man that en@@ du@@ re@@ th temp@@ tation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the cro@@ wn of life , which the Lord hat@@ h promised to them that love him .
but every man is temp@@ ted , when he is drawn away of his own l@@ ust , and en@@ ticed .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and co@@ me@@ th down from the F@@ ather of lights , with whom is no vari@@ ab@@ len@@ ess , neither shadow of turning .
for if any be a hear@@ er of the word , and not a do@@ er , he is like un@@ to a man be@@ holding his natural face in a glass :
but wh@@ os@@ o lo@@ ok@@ eth into the perfect law of liber@@ ty , and continu@@ eth there@@ in , he being not a F@@ org@@ et@@ ful hear@@ er , but a do@@ er of the work , this man shall be b@@ les@@ sed in his de@@ ed .
if any man among you seem to be religious , and bri@@ d@@ le@@ th not his ton@@ gue , but dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h his own heart , this man 's religion is v@@ ain .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be jud@@ ged by the law of liber@@ ty .
for in many things we off@@ end all . if any man off@@ end not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bri@@ dle the whole body .
be@@ hold , we put bi@@ ts in the hor@@ ses ' m@@ ou@@ ths , that they may obe@@ y us ; and we turn about their whole body .
and the ton@@ gue is a fire , a world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : so is the ton@@ gue among our members , that it def@@ il@@ eth the whole body , and set@@ te@@ th on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
for every kind of be@@ asts , and of birds , and of Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and of things in the sea , is ta@@ med , and hat@@ h been ta@@ med of man@@ kind :
Y@@ e ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is en@@ mity with God ? wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
speak not ev@@ il one of another , bre@@ th@@ ren . he that speak@@ eth ev@@ il of his brother , and jud@@ get@@ h his brother , speak@@ eth ev@@ il of the law , and jud@@ get@@ h the law : but if th@@ ou judge the law , th@@ ou art not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
your gold and silver is can@@ kered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your f@@ les@@ h as it were fire . Y@@ e have he@@ ap@@ ed treasure together for the last days .
be@@ hold , the h@@ ire of the la@@ bour@@ ers who have re@@ ap@@ ed down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , cri@@ eth : and the cri@@ es of them which have re@@ ap@@ ed are entered into the e@@ ars of the Lord of sa@@ ba@@ o@@ th .
Y@@ e have lived in pleas@@ ure on the ear@@ th , and been wan@@ ton ; ye have no@@ ur@@ ished your hear@@ ts , as in a day of sla@@ ughter .
be patient therefore , bre@@ th@@ ren , un@@ to the coming of the Lord . be@@ hold , the hus@@ b@@ and@@ man w@@ ai@@ te@@ th for the pre@@ ci@@ ous fruit of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
take , my bre@@ th@@ ren , the pro@@ ph@@ ets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering aff@@ li@@ ction , and of patience .
be@@ hold , we count them happy which en@@ dur@@ e . Y@@ e have heard of the patience of Jo@@ b , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very p@@ iti@@ ful , and of tender mer@@ cy .
is any si@@ ck among you ? let him call for the el@@ ders of the church ; and let them pra@@ y over him , ano@@ in@@ ting him with oil in the name of the Lord :
and the pray@@ er of faith shall save the si@@ ck , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sin@@ s , they shall be for@@ given him .
Eli@@ as was a man subject to like pas@@ sions as we are , and he pray@@ ed ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly that it might not rain : and it ra@@ ined not on the ear@@ th by the space of three years and six months .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore gir@@ d up the lo@@ ins of your mind , be so@@ ber , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought un@@ to you at the reve@@ lation of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him gl@@ ory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing ye have pur@@ ified your so@@ ul@@ s in obe@@ ying the truth through the Spiri@@ t un@@ to un@@ fe@@ ig@@ ned love of the bre@@ th@@ ren , see that ye love one another with a p@@ ure heart fer@@ v@@ ently :
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , an hol@@ y nation , a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people ; that ye should she@@ w forth the pra@@ ises of him who hat@@ h called you out of d@@ ark@@ ness into his mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous light :
for so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to sil@@ ence the ignor@@ ance of fo@@ ol@@ ish men :
for what gl@@ ory is it , if , when ye be bu@@ ffe@@ ted for your fa@@ ults , ye shall take it pati@@ ently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it pati@@ ently , this is acceptable with God .
who his own self b@@ are our sin@@ s in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sin@@ s , should live un@@ to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : by whose stri@@ pes ye were he@@ aled .
whose ad@@ or@@ ning let it not be that ou@@ tw@@ ard ad@@ or@@ ning of pla@@ iting the ha@@ ir , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of appar@@ el ;
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble , even the or@@ nament of a me@@ ek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
for after this manner in the old time the hol@@ y women also , who tr@@ usted in God , ad@@ or@@ ned themselves , being in subj@@ ection un@@ to their own hus@@ bands :
for the eyes of the Lord are over the righ@@ te@@ ous , and his e@@ ars are open un@@ to their pray@@ ers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do ev@@ il .
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask@@ eth you a reason of the hope that is in you with me@@ ek@@ ness and fear :
For@@ as@@ much then as Ch@@ r@@ ist hat@@ h suffered for us in the f@@ les@@ h , arm yo@@ ur@@ selves likewise with the same mind : for he that hat@@ h suffered in the f@@ les@@ h hat@@ h ce@@ ased from sin ;
for for this cause was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached also to them that are dead , that they might be jud@@ ged according to men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live according to God in the spirit .
but re@@ jo@@ ice , in@@ as@@ much as ye are par@@ tak@@ ers of Ch@@ r@@ ist 's suffer@@ ings ; that , when his gl@@ ory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
if ye be re@@ pro@@ ached for the name of Ch@@ r@@ ist , happy are ye ; for the spirit of gl@@ ory and of God res@@ te@@ th upon you : on their part he is ev@@ il spoken of , but on your part he is gl@@ ori@@ fied .
but let none of you suffer as a mur@@ der@@ er , or as a th@@ i@@ ef , or as an ev@@ il@@ do@@ er , or as a bus@@ y@@ body in other men 's matters .
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obe@@ y not the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of God ?
likewise , ye younger , submit yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the el@@ der . Ye@@ a , all of you be subject one to another , and be clo@@ th@@ ed with hum@@ il@@ ity : for God res@@ iste@@ th the proud , and gi@@ vet@@ h grace to the hum@@ ble .
but the God of all grace , who hat@@ h called us un@@ to his eter@@ nal gl@@ ory by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , st@@ ab@@ lish , strengthen , settle you .
for if these things be in you , and ab@@ ound , they make you that ye shall neither be bar@@ ren nor un@@ fruit@@ ful in the knowledge of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but he that la@@ c@@ ket@@ h these things is b@@ lin@@ d , and can@@ not see af@@ ar off , and hat@@ h forgotten that he was p@@ urged from his old sin@@ s .
Ye@@ a , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tab@@ ern@@ acle , to stir you up by putting you in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance ;
for we have not followed c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly dev@@ ised f@@ ables , when we made known un@@ to you the power and coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
for if God spar@@ ed not the an@@ gel@@ s that sin@@ ned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into cha@@ ins of d@@ ark@@ ness , to be reserved un@@ to judgment ;
and turning the cities of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an en@@ samp@@ le un@@ to those that after should live un@@ go@@ dly ;
and shall receive the reward of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , as they that count it pleas@@ ure to riot in the day time . spots they are and ble@@ mis@@ hes , spor@@ ting themselves with their own dec@@ e@@ iv@@ ings while they feast with you ;
having eyes full of ad@@ ul@@ tery , and that can@@ not ce@@ ase from sin ; be@@ guil@@ ing unstable so@@ ul@@ s : an heart they have exerc@@ ised with c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous practices ; Cur@@ sed children :
which have for@@ sak@@ en the right way , and are gone as@@ tra@@ y , following the way of Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Bos@@ or , who lov@@ ed the wages of un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ;
for when they speak great s@@ wel@@ ling words of van@@ ity , they al@@ l@@ ure through the lu@@ sts of the f@@ les@@ h , through much wan@@ ton@@ ness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in er@@ ror .
while they promise them liber@@ ty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bon@@ da@@ ge .
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led there@@ in , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
that ye may be min@@ d@@ ful of the words which were spoken before by the hol@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of the comman@@ d@@ ment of us the A@@ post@@ les of the Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our :
for this they will@@ ingly are ignor@@ ant of , that by the word of God the heav@@ ens were of old , and the ear@@ th standing out of the water and in the water :
but the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved un@@ to fire against the day of judgment and per@@ di@@ tion of un@@ go@@ dly men .
but , bel@@ ov@@ ed , be not ignor@@ ant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the Lord is not S@@ lack concerning his promise , as some men count sla@@ ck@@ ness ; but is long@@ suffering to us @@@ -@@ @ ward , not willing that any should per@@ ish , but that all should come to rep@@ ent@@ ance .
and account that the long@@ suffering of our Lord is sal@@ vation ; even as our bel@@ ov@@ ed brother Paul also according to the wis@@ dom given un@@ to him hat@@ h written un@@ to you ;
Y@@ e therefore , bel@@ ov@@ ed , seeing ye know these things before , be@@ w@@ are lest ye also , being led away with the er@@ ror of the w@@ ic@@ ked , fall from your own ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ness .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Wor@@ d of life ;
( for the life was manif@@ ested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and she@@ w un@@ to you that eter@@ nal life , which was with the F@@ ather , and was manif@@ ested un@@ to us ; )
that which we have seen and heard declare we un@@ to you , that ye also may have fel@@ low@@ ship with us : and truly our fel@@ low@@ ship is with the F@@ ather , and with his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare un@@ to you , that God is light , and in him is no d@@ ark@@ ness at all .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fel@@ low@@ ship one with another , and the blood of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist his Son cleans@@ eth us from all sin .
my little children , these things write I un@@ to you , that ye sin not . and if any man sin , we have an advocate with the F@@ ather , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist the righ@@ te@@ ous :
but he that ha@@ te@@ th his brother is in d@@ ark@@ ness , and walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness , and know@@ eth not w@@ hi@@ ther he go@@ eth , because that d@@ ark@@ ness hat@@ h b@@ lin@@ ded his eyes .
I write un@@ to you , fa@@ thers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write un@@ to you , young men , because ye have overcome the w@@ ic@@ ked one . I write un@@ to you , little children , because ye have known the F@@ ather .
I have written un@@ to you , fa@@ thers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written un@@ to you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abi@@ de@@ th in you , and ye have overcome the w@@ ic@@ ked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the F@@ ather is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , and the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the F@@ ather , but is of the world .
they went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manif@@ est that they were not all of us .
I have not written un@@ to you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever den@@ i@@ eth the Son , the same hat@@ h not the F@@ ather : ( but ) he that acknowled@@ get@@ h the Son hat@@ h the F@@ ather also .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be as@@ ha@@ med before him at his coming .
bel@@ ov@@ ed , now are we the sons of God , and it do@@ th not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
he that commit@@ te@@ th sin is of the dev@@ il ; for the dev@@ il sin@@ net@@ h from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manif@@ ested , that he might destroy the works of the dev@@ il .
in this the children of God are manif@@ est , and the children of the dev@@ il : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth not righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is not of God , neither he that lov@@ eth not his brother .
we know that we have passed from death un@@ to life , because we love the bre@@ th@@ ren . he that lov@@ eth not his brother abi@@ de@@ th in death .
Her@@ e@@ by perce@@ ive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the bre@@ th@@ ren .
but wh@@ os@@ o hat@@ h this world 's good , and se@@ eth his brother have need , and shut@@ te@@ th up his bo@@ wel@@ s of comp@@ as@@ sion from him , how d@@ wel@@ le@@ th the love of God in him ?
and this is his comman@@ d@@ ment , That we should believe on the name of his Son J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and love one another , as he gave us comman@@ d@@ ment .
and every spirit that conf@@ ess@@ eth not that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is come in the f@@ les@@ h is not of God : and this is that spirit of anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , where@@ of ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
Y@@ e are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
we are of God : he that know@@ eth God he@@ aret@@ h us ; he that is not of God he@@ aret@@ h not us . Her@@ e@@ by know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of er@@ ror .
in this was manif@@ ested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only be@@ gotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
and we have known and believed the love that God hat@@ h to us . God is love ; and he that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in love d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in God , and God in him .
if a man say , I love God , and ha@@ te@@ th his brother , he is a li@@ ar : for he that lov@@ eth not his brother whom he hat@@ h seen , how can he love God whom he hat@@ h not seen ?
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever believ@@ eth that J@@ es@@ us is the Ch@@ r@@ ist is born of God : and every one that lov@@ eth him that beg@@ at lov@@ eth him also that is be@@ gotten of him .
this is he that came by water and blood , even J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ; not by water only , but by water and blood . and it is the Spiri@@ t that be@@ aret@@ h witness , because the Spiri@@ t is truth .
he that believ@@ eth on the Son of God hat@@ h the witness in himself : he that believ@@ eth not God hat@@ h made him a li@@ ar ; because he believ@@ eth not the record that God gave of his Son .
these things have I written un@@ to you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eter@@ nal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
and this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he he@@ aret@@ h us :
and if we know that he hear us , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever we ask , we know that we have the peti@@ tions that we desi@@ red of him .
grace be with you , mer@@ cy , and peace , from God the F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Son of the F@@ ather , in truth and love .
and this is love , that we walk after his comman@@ d@@ ments . this is the comman@@ d@@ ment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
look to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that we lose not those things which we have w@@ rought , but that we receive a full reward .
if there come any un@@ to you , and bring not this doc@@ tr@@ ine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
having many things to write un@@ to you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come un@@ to you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
for I re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed greatly , when the bre@@ th@@ ren came and testified of the truth that is in the@@ e , even as th@@ ou walk@@ est in the truth .
which have bor@@ ne witness of TH@@ Y charity before the church : whom if th@@ ou bring forward on their journey after a go@@ dly sort , th@@ ou s@@ halt do well :
Ju@@ de , the ser@@ vant of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and brother of James , to them that are sanc@@ ti@@ fied by God the F@@ ather , and preserved in J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and called :
I will therefore put you in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having sav@@ ed the people out of the land of Egypt , after@@ ward destroyed them that believed not .
the reve@@ lation of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , which God gave un@@ to him , to she@@ w un@@ to his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and sig@@ ni@@ fied it by his an@@ gel un@@ to his ser@@ vant John :
who b@@ are record of the word of God , and of the testimony of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and of all things that he saw .
b@@ les@@ sed is he that re@@ ade@@ th , and they that hear the words of this pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and keep those things which are written there@@ in : for the time is at hand .
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his m@@ outh went a sharp t@@ wo@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word : and his coun@@ tenance was as the sun sh@@ in@@ eth in his strength .
and when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . and he laid his right hand upon me , saying un@@ to me , Fe@@ ar not ; I am the first and the last :
I am he that li@@ vet@@ h , and was dead ; and , be@@ hold , I am alive for ever@@ more , A@@ men ; and have the ke@@ ys of hell and of death .
the my@@ ster@@ y of the seven stars which th@@ ou sa@@ west in my right hand , and the seven golden cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks . the seven stars are the an@@ gel@@ s of the seven churches : and the seven cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks which th@@ ou sa@@ west are the seven churches .
un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church of E@@ ph@@ es@@ us write ; These things sa@@ ith he that hol@@ de@@ th the seven stars in his right hand , who walk@@ eth in the mid@@ st of the seven golden cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks ;
I know TH@@ Y works , and TH@@ Y labour , and TH@@ Y patience , and how th@@ ou can@@ st not bear them which are ev@@ il : and th@@ ou h@@ ast tried them which say they are A@@ post@@ les , and are not , and h@@ ast found them li@@ ars :
remember therefore from wh@@ ence th@@ ou art fallen , and rep@@ ent , and do the first works ; or else I will come un@@ to the@@ e quickly , and will remove TH@@ Y cand@@ le@@ stick out of his place , except th@@ ou rep@@ ent .
he that hat@@ h an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t sa@@ ith un@@ to the churches ; To him that over@@ co@@ me@@ th will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the mid@@ st of the par@@ ad@@ ise of God .
I know TH@@ Y works , and tri@@ bu@@ lation , and poverty , ( but th@@ ou art rich ) and I know the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write ; These things sa@@ ith the Son of God , who hat@@ h his eyes like un@@ to a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like fine br@@ ass ;
I know TH@@ Y works , and charity , and service , and faith , and TH@@ Y patience , and TH@@ Y works ; and the last to be more than the first .
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which sear@@ ch@@ eth the re@@ ins and hear@@ ts : and I will give un@@ to every one of you according to your works .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Sar@@ dis write ; These things sa@@ ith he that hat@@ h the seven spir@@ its of God , and the seven stars ; I know TH@@ Y works , that th@@ ou h@@ ast a name that th@@ ou li@@ v@@ est , and art dead .
he that over@@ co@@ me@@ th , the same shall be clo@@ th@@ ed in white ra@@ im@@ ent ; and I will not blo@@ t out his name out of the book of life , but I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
and to the an@@ gel of the church in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a write ; These things sa@@ ith he that is hol@@ y , he that is true , he that hat@@ h the key of David , he that open@@ eth , and no man shut@@ te@@ th ; and shut@@ te@@ th , and no man open@@ eth ;
I know TH@@ Y works : be@@ hold , I have set before the@@ e an open door , and no man can shut it : for th@@ ou h@@ ast a little strength , and h@@ ast kept my word , and h@@ ast not denied my name .
be@@ hold , I will make them of the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; be@@ hold , I will make them to come and worship before TH@@ Y feet , and to know that I have lov@@ ed the@@ e .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep the@@ e from the hour of temp@@ tation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that d@@ well upon the ear@@ th .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church of the La@@ odi@@ ce@@ ans write ; These things sa@@ ith the A@@ men , the fa@@ ith@@ ful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
because th@@ ou say@@ est , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and know@@ est not that th@@ ou art w@@ ret@@ ched , and mis@@ er@@ able , and poor , and b@@ lin@@ d , and nak@@ ed :
be@@ hold , I stand at the door , and kno@@ ck : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will su@@ p with him , and he with me .
to him that over@@ co@@ me@@ th will I grant to sit with me in my th@@ r@@ one , even as I also over@@ came , and am set down with my F@@ ather in his th@@ r@@ one .
and he that sat was to look upon like a j@@ as@@ per and a s@@ ard@@ ine stone : and there was a ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w round about the th@@ r@@ one , in sight like un@@ to an Emer@@ ald .
and round about the th@@ r@@ one were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty el@@ ders sitting , clo@@ th@@ ed in white ra@@ im@@ ent ; and they had on their heads crow@@ ns of gold .
and before the th@@ r@@ one there was a sea of glass like un@@ to cr@@ y@@ st@@ al : and in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one , and round about the th@@ r@@ one , were four be@@ asts full of eyes before and behind .
and the first be@@ ast was like a lion , and the second be@@ ast like a cal@@ f , and the third be@@ ast had a face as a man , and the fourth be@@ ast was like a flying e@@ ag@@ le .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the th@@ r@@ one a book written within and on the back@@ side , sealed with seven se@@ als .
and I be@@ held , and , lo , in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one and of the four be@@ asts , and in the mid@@ st of the el@@ ders , stood a lam@@ b as it had been sla@@ in , having seven hor@@ ns and seven eyes , which are the seven spir@@ its of God sent forth into all the ear@@ th .
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the th@@ r@@ one .
and when he had taken the book , the four be@@ asts and four and twenty el@@ ders fell down before the lam@@ b , having every one of them har@@ ps , and golden vi@@ als full of o@@ do@@ urs , which are the pray@@ ers of sa@@ ints .
and I be@@ held , and I heard the voice of many an@@ gel@@ s round about the th@@ r@@ one and the be@@ asts and the el@@ ders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
and I saw , and be@@ hold a white hor@@ se : and he that sat on him had a bo@@ w ; and a cro@@ wn was given un@@ to him : and he went forth conqu@@ ering , and to conqu@@ er .
and when he had opened the third se@@ al , I heard the third be@@ ast say , C@@ ome and see . and I be@@ held , and lo a black hor@@ se ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balan@@ ces in his hand .
and when he had opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of them that were sla@@ in for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and the kings of the ear@@ th , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief cap@@ tains , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men , and every bon@@ d@@ man , and every free man , hi@@ d themselves in the den@@ s and in the ro@@ cks of the mountains ;
and after these things I saw four an@@ gel@@ s standing on the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , holding the four winds of the ear@@ th , that the wind should not blow on the ear@@ th , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
and I saw another an@@ gel as@@ cen@@ ding from the east , having the se@@ al of the living God : and he cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice to the four an@@ gel@@ s , to whom it was given to hurt the ear@@ th and the sea ,
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and for@@ ty and four thousand of all the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
of the tri@@ be of J@@ uda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tri@@ be of As@@ er were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of N@@ ep@@ thal@@ im were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Man@@ ass@@ es were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tri@@ be of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of L@@ evi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tri@@ be of Z@@ ab@@ ul@@ on were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tri@@ be of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and all the an@@ gel@@ s stood round about the th@@ r@@ one , and about the el@@ ders and the four be@@ asts , and fell before the th@@ r@@ one on their faces , and wor@@ shi@@ pped God ,
and I said un@@ to him , S@@ ir , th@@ ou know@@ est . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tri@@ bu@@ lation , and have was@@ hed their rob@@ es , and made them white in the blood of the lam@@ b .
for the lam@@ b which is in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one shall fe@@ ed them , and shall lead them un@@ to living fo@@ un@@ tains of waters : and God shall wi@@ pe away all te@@ ars from their eyes .
and the smoke of the incen@@ se , which came with the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints , as@@ cen@@ ded up before God out of the an@@ gel 's hand .
and the an@@ gel took the cen@@ ser , and filled it with fire of the alt@@ ar , and cast it into the ear@@ th : and there were voices , and th@@ under@@ ings , and ligh@@ t@@ nings , and an earthquake .
the first an@@ gel so@@ unded , and there followed ha@@ il and fire min@@ g@@ led with blood , and they were cast upon the ear@@ th : and the third part of trees was bur@@ n@@ t up , and all green gr@@ ass was bur@@ n@@ t up .
and the third part of the cre@@ atures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the third an@@ gel so@@ unded , and there fell a great star from heav@@ en , burning as it were a lam@@ p , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fo@@ un@@ tains of waters ;
and the name of the star is called Wor@@ m@@ wood : and the third part of the waters became wor@@ m@@ wood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
and he opened the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it ; and there ar@@ ose a smoke out of the p@@ it , as the smoke of a great fur@@ n@@ ace ; and the sun and the air were dar@@ ken@@ ed by reason of the smoke of the p@@ it .
and there came out of the smoke loc@@ ust@@ s upon the ear@@ th : and un@@ to them was given power , as the S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions of the ear@@ th have power .
and it was comman@@ ded them that they should not hurt the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the se@@ al of God in their fore@@ heads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tor@@ mented five months : and their tor@@ ment was as the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ p@@ ion , when he stri@@ ket@@ h a man .
and in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
and the shap@@ es of the loc@@ ust@@ s were like un@@ to hor@@ ses prepared un@@ to battle ; and on their heads were as it were crow@@ ns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had ha@@ ir as the ha@@ ir of women , and their te@@ eth were as the te@@ eth of li@@ ons .
and they had bre@@ ast@@ plates , as it were bre@@ ast@@ plates of iron ; and the sound of their w@@ ings was as the sound of char@@ i@@ ots of many hor@@ ses running to battle .
and they had a king over them , which is the an@@ gel of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it , whose name in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue is Ab@@ add@@ on , but in the Greek ton@@ gue hat@@ h his name A@@ poll@@ yon .
and the number of the army of the hor@@ se@@ men were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
and thus I saw the hor@@ ses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having bre@@ ast@@ plates of fire , and of j@@ ac@@ inth , and bri@@ m@@ stone : and the heads of the hor@@ ses were as the heads of li@@ ons ; and out of their m@@ ou@@ ths issued fire and smoke and bri@@ m@@ stone .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the bri@@ m@@ stone , which issued out of their m@@ ou@@ ths .
for their power is in their m@@ outh , and in their ta@@ ils : for their ta@@ ils were like un@@ to Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
and I saw another m@@ igh@@ ty an@@ gel come down from heav@@ en , clo@@ th@@ ed with a cl@@ oud : and a ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pil@@ lars of fire :
and when the seven th@@ unders had ut@@ tered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heav@@ en saying un@@ to me , Se@@ al up those things which the seven th@@ unders ut@@ tered , and write them not .
but in the days of the voice of the seventh an@@ gel , when he shall begin to sound , the my@@ ster@@ y of God should be finished , as he hat@@ h declared to his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
and the voice which I heard from heav@@ en sp@@ ake un@@ to me again , and said , G@@ o and take the little book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel which stan@@ de@@ th upon the sea and upon the ear@@ th .
and I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my m@@ outh swe@@ et as hon@@ ey : and as soon as I had e@@ aten it , my bel@@ ly was bitter .
and there was given me a Re@@ ed like un@@ to a ro@@ d : and the an@@ gel stood , saying , R@@ ise , and measure the temp@@ le of God , and the alt@@ ar , and them that worship there@@ in .
but the court which is without the temp@@ le leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given un@@ to the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and the hol@@ y city shall they tre@@ ad under fo@@ ot for@@ ty and two months .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proce@@ ede@@ th out of their m@@ outh , and dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th their enem@@ ies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the be@@ ast that as@@ cen@@ de@@ th out of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and they of the people and kin@@ dre@@ ds and ton@@ gues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
and they that d@@ well upon the ear@@ th shall re@@ jo@@ ice over them , and make mer@@ ry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two pro@@ ph@@ ets tor@@ mented them that d@@ wel@@ t on the ear@@ th .
and after three days and an half the Spiri@@ t of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were sla@@ in of men seven thousand : and the re@@ mn@@ ant were aff@@ righ@@ ted , and gave gl@@ ory to the God of heav@@ en .
and the seventh an@@ gel so@@ unded ; and there were great voices in heav@@ en , saying , The k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of this world are become the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of our Lord , and of his Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and his ta@@ il drew the third part of the stars of heav@@ en , and did cast them to the ear@@ th : and the dra@@ g@@ on stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to dev@@ our her child as soon as it was born .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a ro@@ d of iron : and her child was caught up un@@ to God , and to his th@@ r@@ one .
and the woman fled into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , where she hat@@ h a place prepared of God , that they should fe@@ ed her there a thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core days .
and the great dra@@ g@@ on was cast out , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , called the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , which dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h the whole world : he was cast out into the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were cast out with him .
and they over@@ came him by the blood of the lam@@ b , and by the word of their testimony ; and they lov@@ ed not their lives un@@ to the death .
and when the dra@@ g@@ on saw that he was cast un@@ to the ear@@ th , he persec@@ uted the woman which brought forth the man child .
and to the woman were given two w@@ ings of a great e@@ ag@@ le , that she might fly into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , into her place , where she is no@@ ur@@ ished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the ser@@ p@@ ent .
and the ser@@ p@@ ent cast out of his m@@ outh water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
and the ear@@ th helped the woman , and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed up the flood which the dra@@ g@@ on cast out of his m@@ outh .
and the dra@@ g@@ on was wro@@ th with the woman , and went to make war with the re@@ mn@@ ant of her se@@ ed , which keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of God , and have the testimony of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
and I stood upon the s@@ and of the sea , and saw a be@@ ast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten hor@@ ns , and upon his hor@@ ns ten crow@@ ns , and upon his heads the name of b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y .
and the be@@ ast which I saw was like un@@ to a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his m@@ outh as the m@@ outh of a lion : and the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the dra@@ g@@ on which gave power un@@ to the be@@ ast : and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the be@@ ast , saying , Wh@@ o is like un@@ to the be@@ ast ? who is able to make war with him ?
and all that d@@ well upon the ear@@ th shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the lam@@ b sla@@ in from the foundation of the world .
he that le@@ ade@@ th into cap@@ tivity shall go into cap@@ tivity : he that kil@@ le@@ th with the s@@ word must be killed with the s@@ word . here is the patience and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
and he exerc@@ is@@ eth all the power of the first be@@ ast before him , and ca@@ us@@ eth the ear@@ th and them which d@@ well there@@ in to worship the first be@@ ast , whose deadly wo@@ und was he@@ aled .
and he do@@ eth great won@@ ders , so that he mak@@ eth fire come down from heav@@ en on the ear@@ th in the sight of men ,
and he had power to give life un@@ to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the be@@ ast should be killed .
and he ca@@ us@@ eth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their fore@@ heads :
here is wis@@ dom . let him that hat@@ h understanding count the number of the be@@ ast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Si@@ x hundred thre@@ es@@ core and six .
and I looked , and , lo , a lam@@ b stood on the mount S@@ ion , and with him an hundred for@@ ty and four thousand , having his F@@ ather 's name written in their fore@@ heads .
and I heard a voice from heav@@ en , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great Th@@ under : and I heard the voice of har@@ pers har@@ ping with their har@@ ps :
and in their m@@ outh was found no gu@@ ile : for they are without fault before the th@@ r@@ one of God .
and the smoke of their tor@@ ment as@@ cen@@ de@@ th up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever recei@@ vet@@ h the mark of his name .
and I looked , and be@@ hold a white cl@@ oud , and upon the cl@@ oud one sat like un@@ to the Son of man , having on his head a golden cro@@ wn , and in his hand a sharp si@@ ck@@ le .
and another an@@ gel came out of the temp@@ le , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice to him that sat on the cl@@ oud , th@@ rust in TH@@ Y si@@ ck@@ le , and re@@ ap : for the time is come for the@@ e to re@@ ap ; for the har@@ v@@ est of the ear@@ th is ri@@ pe .
and the win@@ e@@ press was tro@@ dden without the city , and blood came out of the win@@ e@@ press , even un@@ to the hor@@ se bri@@ d@@ les , by the space of a thousand and six hundred fur@@ lon@@ gs .
and I saw as it were a sea of glass min@@ g@@ led with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the be@@ ast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the har@@ ps of God .
and after that I looked , and , be@@ hold , the temp@@ le of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony in heav@@ en was opened :
and the seven an@@ gel@@ s came out of the temp@@ le , having the seven plagu@@ es , clo@@ th@@ ed in p@@ ure and white lin@@ en , and having their bre@@ asts gir@@ ded with golden gir@@ d@@ les .
and the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temp@@ le , ti@@ ll the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s were fulfilled .
and the first went , and p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the ear@@ th ; and there fell a no@@ is@@ ome and gri@@ ev@@ ous sor@@ e upon the men which had the mark of the be@@ ast , and upon them which wor@@ shi@@ pped his image .
and the second an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living sou@@ l died in the sea .
and I heard the an@@ gel of the waters say , T@@ ho@@ u art righ@@ te@@ ous , O Lord , which art , and w@@ ast , and s@@ halt be , because th@@ ou h@@ ast jud@@ ged thus .
and the fourth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the sun ; and power was given un@@ to him to scor@@ ch men with fire .
and men were scor@@ ched with great heat , and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the name of God , which hat@@ h power over these plagu@@ es : and they re@@ pen@@ ted not to give him gl@@ ory .
and the fifth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the seat of the be@@ ast ; and his k@@ ing@@ dom was full of d@@ ark@@ ness ; and they gn@@ a@@ wed their ton@@ gues for p@@ ain ,
and the sixth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the great river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates ; and the water there@@ of was dri@@ ed up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three un@@ clean spir@@ its like fro@@ gs come out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t .
for they are the spir@@ its of dev@@ ils , working mir@@ ac@@ les , which go forth un@@ to the kings of the ear@@ th and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
and the seventh an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temp@@ le of heav@@ en , from the th@@ r@@ one , saying , It is done .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Bab@@ yl@@ on came in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance before God , to give un@@ to her the c@@ up of the wine of the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath .
and there came one of the seven an@@ gel@@ s which had the seven vi@@ als , and talked with me , saying un@@ to me , C@@ ome hi@@ ther ; I will she@@ w un@@ to the@@ e the judgment of the great wh@@ ore that sit@@ te@@ th upon many waters :
with whom the kings of the ear@@ th have committed for@@ nic@@ ation , and the inhabitants of the ear@@ th have been made dr@@ un@@ k with the wine of her for@@ nic@@ ation .
and upon her fore@@ head was a name written , my@@ ster@@ y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ L@@ O@@ N the great , the mother of H@@ AR@@ L@@ O@@ T@@ S and AB@@ O@@ MI@@ NAT@@ I@@ O@@ NS of the Earth .
and I saw the woman dr@@ un@@ ken with the blood of the sa@@ ints , and with the blood of the m@@ art@@ yr@@ s of J@@ es@@ us : and when I saw her , I won@@ dered with great ad@@ mir@@ ation .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he co@@ me@@ th , he must continue a short space .
and the ten hor@@ ns which th@@ ou sa@@ west are ten kings , which have received no k@@ ing@@ dom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the be@@ ast .
and the ten hor@@ ns which th@@ ou sa@@ west upon the be@@ ast , these shall h@@ ate the wh@@ ore , and shall make her de@@ so@@ late and nak@@ ed , and shall eat her f@@ les@@ h , and bur@@ n her with fire .
and he cri@@ ed m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly with a strong voice , saying , Bab@@ yl@@ on the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habi@@ tation of dev@@ ils , and the hold of every f@@ oul spirit , and a c@@ age of every un@@ clean and ha@@ te@@ ful bird .
for all nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her for@@ nic@@ ation , and the kings of the ear@@ th have committed for@@ nic@@ ation with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th are wa@@ xed rich through the ab@@ und@@ ance of her de@@ lic@@ acies .
and the kings of the ear@@ th , who have committed for@@ nic@@ ation and lived deli@@ ci@@ ously with her , shall be@@ wa@@ il her , and la@@ ment for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
and a m@@ igh@@ ty an@@ gel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Th@@ us with violence shall that great city Bab@@ yl@@ on be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and the light of a cand@@ le shall sh@@ ine no more at all in the@@ e ; and the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and of the bri@@ de shall be heard no more at all in the@@ e : for TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts were the great men of the ear@@ th ; for by TH@@ Y sor@@ cer@@ ies were all nations dec@@ e@@ ived .
and in her was found the blood of pro@@ ph@@ ets , and of sa@@ ints , and of all that were sla@@ in upon the ear@@ th .
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments : for he hat@@ h jud@@ ged the great wh@@ ore , which did corrupt the ear@@ th with her for@@ nic@@ ation , and hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand .
let us be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the lam@@ b is come , and his wife hat@@ h made her@@ self ready .
and to her was granted that she should be ar@@ ray@@ ed in fine lin@@ en , clean and white : for the fine lin@@ en is the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of sa@@ ints .
his eyes were as a fla@@ me of fire , and on his head were many crow@@ ns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
and I saw the be@@ ast , and the kings of the ear@@ th , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the hor@@ se , and against his army .
and the re@@ mn@@ ant were sla@@ in with the s@@ word of him that sat upon the hor@@ se , which s@@ word proce@@ eded out of his m@@ outh : and all the fo@@ w@@ ls were filled with their f@@ les@@ h .
and he laid hold on the dra@@ g@@ on , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , which is the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , and bound him a thousand years ,
b@@ les@@ sed and hol@@ y is he that hat@@ h part in the first resur@@ rec@@ tion : on such the second death hat@@ h no power , but they shall be pri@@ ests of God and of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and shall go out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four quarters of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
and they went up on the b@@ read@@ th of the ear@@ th , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the camp of the sa@@ ints about , and the bel@@ ov@@ ed city : and fire came down from God out of heav@@ en , and dev@@ oured them .
and the dev@@ il that dec@@ e@@ ived them was cast into the lake of fire and bri@@ m@@ stone , where the be@@ ast and the false pro@@ phe@@ t are , and shall be tor@@ mented day and night for ever and ever .
and I saw a great white th@@ r@@ one , and him that sat on it , from whose face the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were jud@@ ged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were jud@@ ged every man according to their works .
and God shall wi@@ pe away all te@@ ars from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sor@@ row , nor cr@@ ying , neither shall there be any more p@@ ain : for the former things are passed away .
and there came un@@ to me one of the seven an@@ gel@@ s which had the seven vi@@ als full of the seven last plagu@@ es , and talked with me , saying , C@@ ome hi@@ ther , I will she@@ w the@@ e the bri@@ de , the lam@@ b 's wife .
and had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve an@@ gel@@ s , and names written there@@ on , which are the names of the twelve tri@@ bes of the children of Israel :
and the city li@@ eth fo@@ ur@@ square , and the length is as large as the b@@ read@@ th : and he meas@@ ured the city with the Re@@ ed , twelve thousand fur@@ lon@@ gs . the length and the b@@ read@@ th and the he@@ ight of it are equal .
and he meas@@ ured the wall there@@ of , an hundred and for@@ ty and four cu@@ bi@@ ts , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the an@@ gel .
and the building of the wall of it was of j@@ as@@ per : and the city was p@@ ure gold , like un@@ to clear glass .
and the twelve gates were twelve pe@@ ar@@ ls ; every several gate was of one pe@@ ar@@ l : and the street of the city was p@@ ure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to sh@@ ine in it : for the gl@@ ory of God did ligh@@ ten it , and the lam@@ b is the light there@@ of .
and the nations of them which are sav@@ ed shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the ear@@ th do bring their gl@@ ory and honour into it .
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
and he she@@ wed me a p@@ ure river of water of life , clear as cr@@ y@@ st@@ al , proce@@ eding out of the th@@ r@@ one of God and of the lam@@ b .
and there shall be no more cur@@ se : but the th@@ r@@ one of God and of the lam@@ b shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel which she@@ wed me these things .
he that is un@@ just , let him be un@@ just still : and he which is fil@@ thy , let him be fil@@ thy still : and he that is righ@@ te@@ ous , let him be righ@@ te@@ ous still : and he that is hol@@ y , let him be hol@@ y still .
and , be@@ hold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
b@@ les@@ sed are they that do his comman@@ d@@ ments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
for I testify un@@ to every man that he@@ aret@@ h the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of this book , If any man shall add un@@ to these things , God shall add un@@ to him the plagu@@ es that are written in this book :
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the hol@@ y city , and from the things which are written in this book .
