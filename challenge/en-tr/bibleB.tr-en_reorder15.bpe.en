and the ear@@ th brought forth gr@@ ass , and her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed after his kind , and the tree yi@@ el@@ ding fruit , whose se@@ ed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God created great wh@@ al@@ es , and every living cre@@ ature that mov@@ eth , which the waters brought forth ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , after their kind , and every w@@ ing@@ ed fo@@ w@@ l after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made the be@@ ast of the ear@@ th after his kind , and c@@ attle after their kind , and every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and over the c@@ attle , and over all the ear@@ th , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
and God b@@ les@@ sed them , and God said un@@ to them , Be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply , and rep@@ len@@ ish the ear@@ th , and sub@@ due it : and have domin@@ ion over the fish of the sea , and over the fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and over every living thing that mov@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
and God said , be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b bearing se@@ ed , which is upon the face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every be@@ ast of the ear@@ th , and to every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , and to every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , where@@ in there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for meat : and it was so .
these are the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens ,
and every plant of the field before it was in the ear@@ th , and every her@@ b of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the ear@@ th , and there was not a man to ti@@ ll the ground .
and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleas@@ ant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the mid@@ st of the gar@@ den , and the tree of knowledge of good and ev@@ il .
and they heard the voice of the Lord God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day : and A@@ dam and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of the Lord God am@@ on@@ g@@ st the trees of the gar@@ den .
in the swe@@ at of TH@@ Y face s@@ halt th@@ ou eat bread , ti@@ ll th@@ ou return un@@ to the ground ; for out of it w@@ ast th@@ ou taken : for d@@ ust th@@ ou art , and un@@ to d@@ ust s@@ halt th@@ ou return .
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den Cher@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and a f@@ laming s@@ word which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast driven me out this day from the face of the ear@@ th ; and from TH@@ Y face shall I be hi@@ d ; and I shall be a fugitive and a v@@ ag@@ ab@@ ond in the ear@@ th ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that fin@@ de@@ th me shall s@@ lay me .
and it came to pass , when men began to multi@@ ply on the face of the ear@@ th , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were born un@@ to them ,
that the sons of God saw the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wi@@ ves of all which they chose .
and the Lord said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ear@@ th ; both man , and be@@ ast , and the cre@@ eping thing , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air ; for it re@@ pen@@ te@@ th me that I have made them .
and this is the fashion which th@@ ou s@@ halt make it of : the length of the Ar@@ k shall be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , the b@@ read@@ th of it fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of it thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
a window s@@ halt th@@ ou make to the Ar@@ k , and in a cu@@ bit s@@ halt th@@ ou finish it above ; and the door of the Ar@@ k s@@ halt th@@ ou set in the side there@@ of ; with lower , second , and third stories s@@ halt th@@ ou make it .
and , be@@ hold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h , where@@ in is the bre@@ ath of life , from under heav@@ en ; and every thing that is in the ear@@ th shall die .
but with the@@ e will I establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt come into the Ar@@ k , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y wife , and TH@@ Y sons ' wi@@ ves with the@@ e .
and of every living thing of all f@@ les@@ h , two of every sort s@@ halt th@@ ou bring into the Ar@@ k , to keep them alive with the@@ e ; they shall be male and female .
of fo@@ w@@ ls after their kind , and of c@@ attle after their kind , of every cre@@ eping thing of the ear@@ th after his kind , two of every sort shall come un@@ to the@@ e , to keep them alive .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the ear@@ th for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights ; and every living sub@@ stance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and No@@ ah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wi@@ ves with him , into the Ar@@ k , because of the waters of the flood .
in the six hund@@ red@@ th year of No@@ ah 's life , in the second month , the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , the same day were all the fo@@ un@@ tains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heav@@ en were opened .
in the sel@@ f@@ same day entered No@@ ah , and S@@ hem , and ham , and Jap@@ het@@ h , the sons of No@@ ah , and No@@ ah 's wife , and the three wi@@ ves of his sons with them , into the Ar@@ k ;
they , and every be@@ ast after his kind , and all the c@@ attle after their kind , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th after his kind , and every fo@@ w@@ l after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and the flood was for@@ ty days upon the ear@@ th ; and the waters increased , and b@@ are up the Ar@@ k , and it was lift up above the ear@@ th .
and God remember@@ ed No@@ ah , and every living thing , and all the c@@ attle that was with him in the Ar@@ k : and God made a wind to pass over the ear@@ th , and the waters ass@@ w@@ aged ;
and the waters decreased continu@@ ally until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and the do@@ ve came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her m@@ outh was an olive le@@ af p@@ lu@@ ck@@ t off : so No@@ ah knew that the waters were ab@@ ated from off the ear@@ th .
and it came to pass in the six hund@@ red@@ th and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dri@@ ed up from off the ear@@ th : and No@@ ah removed the covering of the Ar@@ k , and looked , and , be@@ hold , the face of the ground was d@@ ry .
bring forth with the@@ e every living thing that is with the@@ e , of all f@@ les@@ h , both of fo@@ w@@ l , and of c@@ attle , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th ; that they may bre@@ ed ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly in the ear@@ th , and be fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ ply upon the ear@@ th .
and the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you shall be upon every be@@ ast of the ear@@ th , and upon every fo@@ w@@ l of the air , upon all that mov@@ eth upon the ear@@ th , and upon all the fis@@ hes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
and su@@ rely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every be@@ ast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you ; neither shall all f@@ les@@ h be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the ear@@ th .
and I will remember my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which is between me and you and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all f@@ les@@ h .
and the bo@@ w shall be in the cl@@ oud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between God and every living cre@@ ature of all f@@ les@@ h that is upon the ear@@ th .
and S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it upon both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , and went back@@ ward , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father ; and their faces were back@@ ward , and they saw not their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from S@@ id@@ on , as th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st to Ger@@ ar , un@@ to Gaza ; as th@@ ou go@@ est , un@@ to So@@ dom , and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ im , even un@@ to L@@ as@@ ha .
and it came to pass , as they jour@@ ne@@ yed from the east , that they found a pla@@ in in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar ; and they d@@ wel@@ t there .
and they said , G@@ o to , let us build us a city and a to@@ wer , whose top may reach un@@ to heav@@ en ; and let us make us a name , lest we be sc@@ at@@ tered abroad upon the face of the whole ear@@ th .
and the Lord said , be@@ hold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be re@@ strained from them , which they have imag@@ ined to do .
so the Lord sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad from th@@ ence upon the face of all the ear@@ th : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Bab@@ el ; because the Lord did there con@@ found the language of all the ear@@ th : and from th@@ ence did the Lord sc@@ at@@ ter them abroad upon the face of all the ear@@ th .
and Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took them wi@@ ves : the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai ; and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an , the father of Mil@@ ca@@ h , and the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
and Ter@@ ah took Ab@@ ram his son , and lot the son of Har@@ an his son 's son , and Sar@@ ai his daughter in law , his son Ab@@ ram 's wife ; and they went forth with them from U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and they came un@@ to Har@@ an , and d@@ wel@@ t there .
and Ab@@ ram took Sar@@ ai his wife , and lot his brother 's son , and all their sub@@ stance that they had gathered , and the so@@ ul@@ s that they had gotten in Har@@ an ; and they went forth to go into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and into the land of Can@@ a@@ an they came .
and he removed from th@@ ence un@@ to a mountain on the east of Be@@ the@@ l , and pit@@ ched his tent , having Be@@ the@@ l on the west , and H@@ ai on the east : and there he buil@@ ded an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord , and called upon the name of the Lord .
and there was a fam@@ ine in the land : and Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; for the fam@@ ine was gri@@ ev@@ ous in the land .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said un@@ to Sar@@ ai his wife , be@@ hold now , I know that th@@ ou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall see the@@ e , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save the@@ e alive .
why sa@@ id@@ st th@@ ou , S@@ he is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore be@@ hold TH@@ Y wife , take her , and go TH@@ Y way .
and there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's c@@ attle and the her@@ d@@ men of lot 's c@@ attle : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite d@@ wel@@ led then in the land .
is not the whole land before the@@ e ? separate th@@ y@@ self , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from me : if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if th@@ ou de@@ part to the right hand , then I will go to the left .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Ab@@ ram the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the pla@@ in of Mam@@ re the Am@@ or@@ ite , brother of E@@ sch@@ ol , and brother of An@@ er : and these were conf@@ eder@@ ate with Ab@@ ram .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smo@@ te them , and pursu@@ ed them un@@ to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
and the king of So@@ dom went out to meet him after his return from the sla@@ ughter of Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer , and of the kings that were with him , at the val@@ ley of Sha@@ ve@@ h , which is the king 's D@@ ale .
and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came un@@ to him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine he@@ ir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bo@@ wel@@ s shall be th@@ ine he@@ ir .
and Sar@@ ai Ab@@ ram 's wife took Hag@@ ar her ma@@ id the Egyptian , after Ab@@ ram had d@@ wel@@ t ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to her husband Ab@@ ram to be his wife .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to her , be@@ hold , th@@ ou art with child , and s@@ halt bear a son , and s@@ halt call his name I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el ; because the Lord hat@@ h heard TH@@ Y aff@@ li@@ ction .
and I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the@@ e and TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e in their generations for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , to be a God un@@ to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e .
and as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard the@@ e : be@@ hold , I have b@@ les@@ sed him , and will make him fruit@@ ful , and will multi@@ ply him exce@@ ed@@ ingly ; twelve pr@@ inces shall he be@@ get , and I will make him a great nation .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's house ; and circum@@ c@@ ised the f@@ les@@ h of their fo@@ res@@ kin in the sel@@ f@@ same day , as God had said un@@ to him .
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bo@@ wed himself toward the ground ,
and there came two an@@ gel@@ s to So@@ dom at even ; and lot sat in the gate of So@@ dom : and lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bo@@ wed himself with his face toward the ground ;
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of So@@ dom , comp@@ ass@@ ed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and while he lin@@ gered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; the Lord being mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
be@@ hold now , TH@@ Y ser@@ vant hat@@ h found grace in TH@@ Y sight , and th@@ ou h@@ ast mag@@ ni@@ fied TH@@ Y mer@@ cy , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to me in saving my life ; and I can@@ not escape to the mountain , lest some ev@@ il take me , and I die :
and he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the mid@@ st of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which lot d@@ wel@@ t .
and lot went up out of Zo@@ ar , and d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters with him ; for he fear@@ ed to d@@ well in Zo@@ ar : and he d@@ wel@@ t in a cave , he and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the fir@@ st@@ born went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger ar@@ ose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
and it came to pass , when God caused me to w@@ ander from my father 's house , that I said un@@ to her , This is TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness which th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w un@@ to me ; at every place w@@ hi@@ ther we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
and God said un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , Let it not be gri@@ ev@@ ous in TH@@ Y sight because of the la@@ d , and because of TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ woman ; in all that Sar@@ ah hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , he@@ arken un@@ to her voice ; for in I@@ sa@@ ac shall TH@@ Y se@@ ed be called .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bo@@ w@@ shot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and we@@ pt .
thus they made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant at Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : then A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and P@@ hic@@ hol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham rose up early in the morning , and s@@ add@@ led his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and cla@@ ve the wood for the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and rose up , and went un@@ to the place of which God had told him .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham built an alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar upon the wood .
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold behind him a ram caught in a th@@ ic@@ ket by his hor@@ ns : and Ab@@ ra@@ ham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering in the stead of his son .
that in b@@ les@@ sing I will b@@ less the@@ e , and in multi@@ plying I will multi@@ ply TH@@ Y se@@ ed as the stars of the heav@@ en , and as the s@@ and which is upon the sea shore ; and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies ;
and he commun@@ ed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and in@@ treat for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
that he may give me the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which he hat@@ h , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place am@@ on@@ g@@ st you .
and E@@ ph@@ ron d@@ wel@@ t among the children of H@@ eth : and E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
and Ab@@ ra@@ ham hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ron ; and Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , current money with the mer@@ chan@@ t .
and after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re : the same is He@@ br@@ on in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and I will make the@@ e swe@@ ar by the Lord , the God of heav@@ en , and the God of the ear@@ th , that th@@ ou s@@ halt not take a wife un@@ to my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I d@@ well :
and the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls of the ca@@ me@@ ls of his master , and depar@@ ted ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , un@@ to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and he made his ca@@ me@@ ls to k@@ ne@@ el down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel , son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher upon her sho@@ ul@@ der .
and the dam@@ sel was very fair to look upon , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
and it came to pass , as the ca@@ me@@ ls had done drinking , that the man took a golden ear@@ ring of half a sh@@ ek@@ el weight , and two brac@@ ele@@ ts for her hands of ten sh@@ ek@@ els weight of gold ;
and he said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , who hat@@ h not left de@@ stitute my master of his mer@@ cy and his truth : I being in the way , the Lord led me to the house of my master 's bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he said un@@ to me , The Lord , before whom I walk , will send his an@@ gel with the@@ e , and prosp@@ er TH@@ Y way ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt take a wife for my son of my kin@@ d@@ red , and of my father 's house :
be@@ hold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the vir@@ gin co@@ me@@ th forth to draw water , and I say to her , Gi@@ ve me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , a little water of TH@@ Y pit@@ cher to drink ;
and I bo@@ wed down my head , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord , and b@@ les@@ sed the Lord God of my master Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter un@@ to his son .
and it came to pass , that , when Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's ser@@ vant heard their words , he wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord , bo@@ wing himself to the ear@@ th .
and the ser@@ vant brought forth je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother pre@@ ci@@ ous things .
and I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the ev@@ enti@@ de : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , the ca@@ me@@ ls were coming .
but un@@ to the sons of the conc@@ ub@@ ines , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham had , Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave gifts , and sent them away from I@@ sa@@ ac his son , while he yet lived , eas@@ tw@@ ard , un@@ to the east country .
and his sons I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ;
now these are the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham :
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ a@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ ed@@ ar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
and these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the gh@@ ost and died ; and was gathered un@@ to his people .
So@@ jour@@ n in this land , and I will be with the@@ e , and will b@@ less the@@ e ; for un@@ to the@@ e , and un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sw@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham TH@@ Y father ;
and I will make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to multi@@ ply as the stars of heav@@ en , and will give un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed all these countries ; and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , be@@ hold , I@@ sa@@ ac was spor@@ ting with Re@@ bek@@ ah his wife .
for all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them , and filled them with ear@@ th .
and I@@ sa@@ ac dig@@ ged again the wel@@ ls of water , which they had dig@@ ged in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father ; for the phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them after the death of Ab@@ ra@@ ham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
and it came to pass , that when I@@ sa@@ ac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called E@@ sa@@ u his el@@ dest son , and said un@@ to him , My son : and he said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , here am I@@ .
go now to the flock , and f@@ et@@ ch me from th@@ ence two good kids of the go@@ ats ; and I will make them sav@@ our@@ y meat for TH@@ Y father , such as he lov@@ eth :
and he said , Br@@ ing it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my sou@@ l may b@@ less the@@ e . and he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he d@@ rank .
and he came near , and k@@ is@@ sed him : and he s@@ mel@@ led the s@@ me@@ ll of his ra@@ im@@ ent , and b@@ les@@ sed him , and said , Se@@ e , the s@@ me@@ ll of my son is as the s@@ me@@ ll of a field which the Lord hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed :
and it came to pass , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b was yet scar@@ ce gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
and by TH@@ Y s@@ word s@@ halt th@@ ou live , and s@@ halt serve TH@@ Y brother ; and it shall come to pass when th@@ ou s@@ halt have the domin@@ ion , that th@@ ou s@@ halt break his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k .
and these words of E@@ sa@@ u her el@@ der son were told to Re@@ bek@@ ah : and she sent and called Jac@@ o@@ b her younger son , and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y brother E@@ sa@@ u , as tou@@ ching the@@ e , do@@ th comfor@@ t himself , pur@@ posing to kill the@@ e .
and he ligh@@ ted upon a certain place , and tar@@ ried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pil@@ lows , and lay down in that place to sle@@ ep .
and he dre@@ amed , and be@@ hold a la@@ d@@ der set up on the ear@@ th , and the top of it reached to heav@@ en : and be@@ hold the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on it .
and TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall be as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and th@@ ou s@@ halt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in the@@ e and in TH@@ Y se@@ ed shall all the families of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed .
and , be@@ hold , I am with the@@ e , and will keep the@@ e in all places w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , and will bring the@@ e again into this land ; for I will not leave the@@ e , until I have done that which I have spoken to the@@ e of .
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pil@@ lows , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil upon the top of it .
and Jac@@ o@@ b vowed a vo@@ w , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and ra@@ im@@ ent to put on ,
and he looked , and be@@ hold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three f@@ loc@@ ks of she@@ ep lying by it ; for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ loc@@ ks : and a great stone was upon the well 's m@@ outh .
and th@@ ither were all the f@@ loc@@ ks gathered : and they rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the she@@ ep , and put the stone again upon the well 's m@@ outh in his place .
and it came to pass , when Jac@@ o@@ b saw R@@ ach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , and the she@@ ep of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , that Jac@@ o@@ b went near , and rol@@ led the stone from the well 's m@@ outh , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Lab@@ an heard the ti@@ dings of Jac@@ o@@ b his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embrac@@ ed him , and k@@ is@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Lab@@ an all these things .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in un@@ to her .
and it came to pass , when R@@ ach@@ el had born Joseph , that Jac@@ o@@ b said un@@ to Lab@@ an , S@@ end me away , that I may go un@@ to mine own place , and to my country .
I will pass through all TH@@ Y flock to day , removing from th@@ ence all the spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted c@@ attle , and all the bro@@ wn c@@ attle among the she@@ ep , and the spot@@ ted and spec@@ k@@ led among the go@@ ats : and of such shall be my h@@ ire .
and he removed that day the he go@@ ats that were r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked and spot@@ ted , and all the she go@@ ats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spot@@ ted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the bro@@ wn among the she@@ ep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and he set the ro@@ ds which he had pil@@ led before the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering t@@ rough@@ s when the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink , that they should conce@@ ive when they came to drink .
and Jac@@ o@@ b did separate the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , and all the bro@@ wn in the flock of Lab@@ an ; and he put his own f@@ loc@@ ks by themselves , and put them not un@@ to Lab@@ an 's c@@ attle .
and it came to pass , wh@@ en@@ so@@ ever the stronger c@@ attle did conce@@ ive , that Jac@@ o@@ b laid the ro@@ ds before the eyes of the c@@ attle in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conce@@ ive among the ro@@ ds .
and it came to pass at the time that the c@@ attle conce@@ ived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , be@@ hold , the r@@ ams which le@@ ap@@ ed upon the c@@ attle were r@@ ing@@ str@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gr@@ is@@ led .
and he carried away all his c@@ attle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the c@@ attle of his getting , which he had gotten in P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , for to go to I@@ sa@@ ac his father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , and into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the two ma@@ id@@ servants ' ten@@ ts ; but he found them not . then went he out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
that which was torn of be@@ asts I brought not un@@ to the@@ e ; I b@@ are the loss of it ; of my hand di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
and early in the morning Lab@@ an rose up , and k@@ is@@ sed his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and b@@ les@@ sed them : and Lab@@ an depar@@ ted , and returned un@@ to his place .
I am not wor@@ thy of the least of all the mer@@ cies , and of all the truth , which th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed un@@ to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of E@@ sa@@ u : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and when he saw that he prev@@ ailed not against him , he touched the hol@@ low of his th@@ igh ; and the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sin@@ ew which sh@@ rank , which is upon the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , un@@ to this day : because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew that sh@@ rank .
and Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children un@@ to Le@@ ah , and un@@ to R@@ ach@@ el , and un@@ to the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
let my lor@@ d , I pra@@ y the@@ e , pass over before his ser@@ vant : and I will lead on sof@@ tly , according as the c@@ attle that go@@ eth before me and the children be able to en@@ dur@@ e , until I come un@@ to my lor@@ d un@@ to Se@@ ir .
and Jac@@ o@@ b came to S@@ hal@@ em , a city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from P@@ adan @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am ; and pit@@ ched his tent before the city .
and he bought a par@@ cel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for an hundred pieces of money .
and when Sh@@ ec@@ hem the son of Ham@@ or the H@@ iv@@ ite , pr@@ ince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and def@@ iled her .
then will we give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to you , and we will take your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to us , and we will d@@ well with you , and we will become one people .
and the young man def@@ er@@ red not to do the thing , because he had de@@ light in Jac@@ o@@ b 's daughter : and he was more honour@@ able than all the house of his father .
and un@@ to Ham@@ or and un@@ to Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son hear@@ ken@@ ed all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circum@@ c@@ ised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and they sle@@ w Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went out .
they took their she@@ ep , and their ox@@ en , and their ass@@ es , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an alt@@ ar un@@ to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b all the st@@ range go@@ ds which were in their hand , and all their ear@@ r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars ; and Jac@@ o@@ b hi@@ d them under the o@@ ak which was by Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , that is , Be@@ the@@ l , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an alt@@ ar , and called the place El @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ el : because there God appeared un@@ to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
and Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he talked with him , even a pil@@ lar of stone : and he p@@ oured a drink offering there@@ on , and he p@@ oured oil there@@ on .
and E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves , and his sons , and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and all the persons of his house , and his c@@ attle , and all his be@@ asts , and all his sub@@ stance , which he had got in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jac@@ o@@ b .
and these are the sons of Re@@ uel E@@ sa@@ u 's son ; Duk@@ e N@@ ah@@ ath , Duk@@ e Zer@@ ah , Duk@@ e Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h , Duk@@ e M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the duk@@ es that came of Re@@ uel in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of B@@ ash@@ em@@ ath E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .
and Hus@@ ham died , and Had@@ ad the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , who smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
and Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ han@@ an the son of A@@ ch@@ bor died , and Had@@ ar re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pa@@ u ; and his wife 's name was Meh@@ et@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Mez@@ a@@ ha@@ b .
and these are the names of the duk@@ es that came of E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duk@@ e Tim@@ n@@ ah , Duk@@ e Al@@ v@@ ah , Duk@@ e J@@ eth@@ eth ,
for , be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and , lo , my she@@ af ar@@ ose , and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and , be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es stood round about , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to my she@@ af .
come now therefore , and let us s@@ lay him , and cast him into some p@@ it , and we will say , Some ev@@ il be@@ ast hat@@ h dev@@ oured him : and we shall see what will become of his dre@@ ams .
and Re@@ ub@@ en said un@@ to them , shed no blood , but cast him into this p@@ it that is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his co@@ at , his co@@ at of many c@@ olo@@ urs that was on him ;
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , be@@ hold , a company of I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes came from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad with their ca@@ me@@ ls bearing sp@@ ic@@ ery and bal@@ m and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the p@@ it , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that Ju@@ da@@ h went down from his bre@@ th@@ ren , and turned in to a certain Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , whose name was H@@ ira@@ h .
and O@@ nan knew that the se@@ ed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in un@@ to his brother 's wife , that he sp@@ il@@ led it on the ground , lest that he should give se@@ ed to his brother .
and she ar@@ ose , and went away , and laid by her v@@ ail from her , and put on the gar@@ ments of her wi@@ do@@ who@@ od .
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the I@@ sh@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , which had brought him down th@@ ither .
and he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . and Joseph was a good@@ ly person , and well favoured .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his gar@@ ment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , After this manner did TH@@ Y ser@@ vant to me ; that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
and the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they did there , he was the do@@ er of it .
and it came to pass after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Bak@@ er had off@@ ended their lor@@ d the king of Egypt .
and they dre@@ amed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the Butler and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and in the v@@ ine were three branches : and it was as though it bud@@ ded , and her b@@ los@@ s@@ oms shot forth ; and the clu@@ sters there@@ of brought forth ri@@ pe grap@@ es :
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand : and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up th@@ ine head , and restore the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y place : and th@@ ou s@@ halt deliver P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , after the former manner when th@@ ou w@@ ast his Butler .
yet within three days shall P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h lift up TH@@ Y head from off the@@ e , and shall han@@ g the@@ e on a tree ; and the birds shall eat TH@@ Y f@@ les@@ h from off the@@ e .
and it came to pass the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast un@@ to all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed ; and stood by the other k@@ ine upon the br@@ ink of the river .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt , and all the wise men there@@ of : and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpre@@ t them un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and there was there with us a young man , an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpre@@ t .
and , be@@ hold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and le@@ an@@ fle@@ shed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for bad@@ ness :
and when they had e@@ aten them up , it could not be known that they had e@@ aten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I aw@@ oke .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up cor@@ n under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land per@@ ish not through the fam@@ ine .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in ves@@ tures of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ;
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
and the fam@@ ine was over all the face of the ear@@ th : and Joseph opened all the sto@@ re@@ houses , and sold un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and the fam@@ ine wa@@ xed sor@@ e in the land of Egypt .
and he said , be@@ hold , I have heard that there is cor@@ n in Egypt : get you down th@@ ither , and buy for us from th@@ ence ; that we may live , and not die .
and Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren came , and bo@@ wed down themselves before him with their faces to the ear@@ th .
and he turned himself about from them , and we@@ pt ; and returned to them again , and commun@@ ed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph comman@@ ded to fill their s@@ acks with cor@@ n , and to restore every man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he un@@ to them .
and as one of them opened his s@@ ack to give his ass pro@@ ven@@ der in the In@@ n , he es@@ p@@ ied his money ; for , be@@ hold , it was in his s@@ ack 's m@@ outh .
and the man , the lor@@ d of the country , said un@@ to us , Her@@ e@@ by shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your bre@@ th@@ ren here with me , and take food for the fam@@ ine of your households , and be gone :
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , be@@ hold , every man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not send him , we will not go down : for the man said un@@ to us , Y@@ e shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the m@@ outh of your s@@ acks , carry it again in your hand ; per@@ ad@@ venture it was an over@@ sight :
and it came to pass , when we came to the In@@ n , that we opened our s@@ acks , and , be@@ hold , every man 's money was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans might not eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ; for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again un@@ to the@@ e out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we ste@@ al out of TH@@ Y lor@@ d 's house silver or gold ?
then Ju@@ da@@ h came near un@@ to him , and said , O@@ h my lor@@ d , let TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak a word in my lor@@ d 's e@@ ars , and let not th@@ ine an@@ ger bur@@ n against TH@@ Y ser@@ vant : for th@@ ou art even as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cri@@ ed , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hat@@ h made me a father to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lor@@ d of all his house , and a ru@@ ler throughout all the land of Egypt .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be near un@@ to me , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y children , and TH@@ Y children 's children , and TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks , and TH@@ Y her@@ ds , and all that th@@ ou h@@ ast :
and the f@@ ame there@@ of was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , Joseph 's bre@@ th@@ ren are come : and it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
and take your father and your households , and come un@@ to me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the f@@ at of the land .
now th@@ ou art comman@@ ded , this do ye ; take you w@@ ag@@ ons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wi@@ ves , and bring your father , and come .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said un@@ to them : and when he saw the w@@ ag@@ ons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jac@@ o@@ b their father revi@@ ved :
and Jac@@ o@@ b rose up from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : and the sons of Israel carried Jac@@ o@@ b their father , and their little ones , and their wi@@ ves , in the w@@ ag@@ ons which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had sent to carry him .
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s : all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , which came into Egypt , were thre@@ es@@ core and ten .
and Joseph made ready his char@@ i@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ h@@ en , and presented himself un@@ to him ; and he fell on his nec@@ k , and we@@ pt on his nec@@ k a good while .
and Joseph said un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and un@@ to his father 's house , I will go up , and she@@ w P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and say un@@ to him , My bre@@ th@@ ren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , are come un@@ to me ;
that ye shall say , Th@@ y servants ' trade hat@@ h been about c@@ attle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fa@@ thers : that ye may d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; for every she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
then Joseph came and told P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and said , My father and my bre@@ th@@ ren , and their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and , be@@ hold , they are in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
they said moreover un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , For to so@@ jour@@ n in the land are we come ; for TH@@ Y servants have no pas@@ ture for their f@@ loc@@ ks ; for the fam@@ ine is sor@@ e in the land of Can@@ a@@ an : now therefore , we pra@@ y the@@ e , let TH@@ Y servants d@@ well in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
and Joseph placed his father and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very sor@@ e , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the cor@@ n which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
and they brought their c@@ attle un@@ to Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for hor@@ ses , and for the f@@ loc@@ ks , and for the c@@ attle of the her@@ ds , and for the ass@@ es : and he f@@ ed them with bread for all their c@@ attle for that year .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and four parts shall be your own , for se@@ ed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
and now TH@@ Y two sons , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which were born un@@ to the@@ e in the land of Egypt before I came un@@ to the@@ e into Egypt , are mine ; as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and as for me , when I came from P@@ adan , R@@ ach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come un@@ to E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath : and I buried her there in the way of E@@ ph@@ r@@ ath ; the same is B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near un@@ to him ; and he k@@ is@@ sed them , and embrac@@ ed them .
and Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near un@@ to him .
and Israel stret@@ ched out his right hand , and laid it upon E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , gui@@ ding his hands wit@@ t@@ ingly ; for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , it disp@@ le@@ ased him : and he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head un@@ to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head .
O my sou@@ l , come not th@@ ou into their secret ; un@@ to their assembly , mine honour , be not th@@ ou united : for in their an@@ ger they sle@@ w a man , and in their sel@@ f@@ will they dig@@ ged down a wall .
but his bo@@ w abo@@ de in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty God of Jac@@ o@@ b ; ( from th@@ ence is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel : )
even by the God of TH@@ Y father , who shall help the@@ e ; and by the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , who shall b@@ less the@@ e with b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of heav@@ en above , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the deep that li@@ eth under , b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of the bre@@ asts , and of the w@@ om@@ b :
the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of TH@@ Y father have prev@@ ailed above the b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of my pro@@ gen@@ itors un@@ to the ut@@ most bound of the ever@@ lasting hil@@ ls : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the cro@@ wn of the head of him that was separate from his bre@@ th@@ ren .
all these are the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : and this is it that their father sp@@ ake un@@ to them , and b@@ les@@ sed them ; every one according to his b@@ les@@ sing he b@@ les@@ sed them .
and when Jac@@ o@@ b had made an end of comman@@ ding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yi@@ elded up the gh@@ ost , and was gathered un@@ to his people .
and when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph sp@@ ake un@@ to the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pra@@ y you , in the e@@ ars of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying ,
and Joseph went up to bur@@ y his father : and with him went up all the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , the el@@ ders of his house , and all the el@@ ders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , they left in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , which Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought with the field for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place of E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te , before Mam@@ re .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bon@@ da@@ ge , in mor@@ ter , and in bri@@ ck , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , where@@ in they made them serve , was with ri@@ g@@ our .
and the king of Egypt sp@@ ake to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of which the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah :
and he said , When ye do the office of a mid@@ wife to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w women , and see them upon the sto@@ ols ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an Ar@@ k of bul@@ rus@@ hes , and da@@ ub@@ ed it with sli@@ me and with pit@@ ch , and put the child there@@ in ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's br@@ ink .
and the daughter of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h came down to was@@ h her@@ self at the river ; and her ma@@ i@@ den@@ s walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ar@@ k among the flags , she sent her ma@@ id to f@@ et@@ ch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , be@@ hold , the bab@@ e we@@ pt . and she had comp@@ as@@ sion on him , and said , This is one of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ' children .
and it came to pass in those days , when Mos@@ es was grown , that he went out un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , and looked on their bur@@ den@@ s : and he sp@@ ied an Egyptian s@@ mit@@ ing an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , one of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he sle@@ w the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to s@@ lay Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed by reason of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up un@@ to God by reason of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
now Mos@@ es kept the flock of J@@ eth@@ ro his father in law , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian : and he led the flock to the back@@ side of the de@@ sert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Ho@@ re@@ b .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord appeared un@@ to him in a fla@@ me of fire out of the mid@@ st of a b@@ ush : and he looked , and , be@@ hold , the b@@ ush burned with fire , and the b@@ ush was not consu@@ med .
moreover he said , I am the God of TH@@ Y father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . and Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and to bring them up out of that land un@@ to a good land and a large , un@@ to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey ; un@@ to the place of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites .
now therefore , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel is come un@@ to me : and I have also seen the op@@ pression where@@ with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to God , be@@ hold , when I come un@@ to the children of Israel , and shall say un@@ to them , The God of your fa@@ thers hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say un@@ to them ?
and God said moreover un@@ to Mos@@ es , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to the children of Israel , The Lord God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial un@@ to all generations .
go , and gather the el@@ ders of Israel together , and say un@@ to them , The Lord God of your fa@@ thers , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , of I@@ sa@@ ac , and of Jac@@ o@@ b , appeared un@@ to me , saying , I have su@@ rely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the aff@@ li@@ ction of Egypt un@@ to the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , un@@ to a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
and I will stretch out my hand , and sm@@ ite Egypt with all my won@@ ders which I will do in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and after that he will let you go .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall bor@@ row of her neighbour , and of her that so@@ journ@@ eth in her house , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and ye shall sp@@ oil the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and he said , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand into TH@@ Y bos@@ om again . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om again ; and p@@ lu@@ cked it out of his bos@@ om , and , be@@ hold , it was turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe the@@ e , neither he@@ arken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither he@@ arken un@@ to TH@@ Y voice , that th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the water of the river , and p@@ our it upon the d@@ ry land : and the water which th@@ ou tak@@ est out of the river shall become blood upon the d@@ ry land .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to him , and put words in his m@@ outh : and I will be with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and with his m@@ outh , and will te@@ ach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be TH@@ Y spokesman un@@ to the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to the@@ e instead of a m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be to him instead of God .
and Mos@@ es took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Mos@@ es took the ro@@ d of God in his hand .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , When th@@ ou go@@ est to return into Egypt , see that th@@ ou do all those won@@ ders before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , which I have put in th@@ ine hand : but I will har@@ den his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their aff@@ li@@ ction , then they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have ye not fulfilled your task in making bri@@ ck both yes@@ ter@@ day and to day , as her@@ et@@ o@@ fore ?
and I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age , where@@ in they were st@@ ran@@ gers .
and I have also heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge ; and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and I will bring you in un@@ to the land , concerning the which I did swe@@ ar to give it to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es and un@@ to Aaron , and gave them a charge un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and these are the names of the sons of L@@ evi according to their generations ; Ger@@ sh@@ on , and Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari : and the years of the life of L@@ evi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
and the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h ; Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el : and the years of the life of Ko@@ hat@@ h were an hundred thirty and three years .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to wife ; and she b@@ are him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took him one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el to wife ; and she b@@ are him Ph@@ ine@@ has : these are the heads of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall not he@@ arken un@@ to you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judg@@ ments .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went in un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and they did so as the Lord had comman@@ ded : and Aaron cast down his ro@@ d before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and before his servants , and it became a ser@@ p@@ ent .
get the@@ e un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in the morning ; lo , he go@@ eth out un@@ to the water ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt stand by the river 's br@@ ink against he come ; and the ro@@ d which was turned to a ser@@ p@@ ent s@@ halt th@@ ou take in th@@ ine hand .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , In this th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord : be@@ hold , I will sm@@ ite with the ro@@ d that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron did so , as the Lord comman@@ ded ; and he lifted up the ro@@ d , and smo@@ te the waters that were in the river , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stan@@ k , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the river shall bring forth fro@@ gs ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , which shall go up and come into th@@ ine house , and into TH@@ Y bed@@ chamber , and upon TH@@ Y bed , and into the house of TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people , and into th@@ ine ov@@ ens , and into TH@@ Y k@@ ne@@ ad@@ ing@@ t@@ rough@@ s :
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es , S@@ ay un@@ to Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with TH@@ Y ro@@ d over the stre@@ ams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and the fro@@ gs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and they did so ; for Aaron stret@@ ched out his hand with his ro@@ d , and smo@@ te the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , and it became lice in man , and in be@@ ast ; all the d@@ ust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; lo , he co@@ me@@ th forth to the water ; and say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not let my people go , be@@ hold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies upon the@@ e , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people , and into TH@@ Y houses : and the houses of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
and I will sever in that day the land of Gos@@ h@@ en , in which my people d@@ well , that no s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies shall be there ; to the end th@@ ou may@@ est know that I am the Lord in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th .
and the Lord did so ; and there came a gri@@ ev@@ ous s@@ warm of f@@ lies into the house of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was cor@@ rupted by reason of the s@@ warm of f@@ lies .
and the Lord did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
be@@ hold , the hand of the Lord is upon TH@@ Y c@@ attle which is in the field , upon the hor@@ ses , upon the ass@@ es , upon the ca@@ me@@ ls , upon the ox@@ en , and upon the she@@ ep : there shall be a very gri@@ ev@@ ous mur@@ rain .
and the Lord shall sever between the c@@ attle of Israel and the c@@ attle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not one of the c@@ attle of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . and the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was har@@ dened , and he did not let the people go .
for I will at this time send all my plagu@@ es upon th@@ ine heart , and upon TH@@ Y servants , and upon TH@@ Y people ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know that there is none like me in all the ear@@ th .
and in very de@@ ed for this cause have I raised the@@ e up , for to she@@ w in the@@ e my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the ear@@ th .
be@@ hold , to mor@@ row about this time I will cause it to rain a very gri@@ ev@@ ous ha@@ il , such as hat@@ h not been in Egypt since the foundation there@@ of even until now .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d toward heav@@ en : and the Lord sent Th@@ under and ha@@ il , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord ra@@ ined ha@@ il upon the land of Egypt .
so there was ha@@ il , and fire min@@ g@@ led with the ha@@ il , very gri@@ ev@@ ous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the ha@@ il smo@@ te throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and be@@ ast ; and the ha@@ il smo@@ te every her@@ b of the field , and br@@ ake every tree of the field .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands un@@ to the Lord ; and the Th@@ under shall ce@@ ase , neither shall there be any more ha@@ il ; that th@@ ou may@@ est know how that the ear@@ th is the Lord 's .
and Mos@@ es went out of the city from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and spread abroad his hands un@@ to the Lord : and the th@@ unders and ha@@ il ce@@ ased , and the rain was not p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th .
and that th@@ ou may@@ est tell in the e@@ ars of TH@@ Y son , and of TH@@ Y son 's son , what things I have w@@ rought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
and they shall cover the face of the ear@@ th , that one can@@ not be able to see the ear@@ th : and they shall eat the resi@@ due of that which is escaped , which remain@@ eth un@@ to you from the ha@@ il , and shall eat every tree which grow@@ eth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill TH@@ Y houses , and the houses of all TH@@ Y servants , and the houses of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; which neither TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , nor TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ' fa@@ thers have seen , since the day that they were upon the ear@@ th un@@ to this day . and he turned himself , and went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand over the land of Egypt for the loc@@ ust@@ s , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the ha@@ il hat@@ h left .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his ro@@ d over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the loc@@ ust@@ s .
and the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very gri@@ ev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
and the Lord turned a m@@ igh@@ ty strong west wind , which took away the loc@@ ust@@ s , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one loc@@ ust in all the co@@ asts of Egypt .
speak now in the e@@ ars of the people , and let every man bor@@ row of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . moreover the man Mos@@ es was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h that sit@@ te@@ th upon his th@@ r@@ one , even un@@ to the fir@@ st@@ born of the ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant that is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of be@@ asts .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a do@@ g move his ton@@ gue , against man or be@@ ast : that ye may know how that the Lord do@@ th put a difference between the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and Israel .
and all these TH@@ Y servants shall come down un@@ to me , and bo@@ w down themselves un@@ to me , saying , G@@ et the@@ e out , and all the people that follow the@@ e : and after that I will go out . and he went out from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h in a great an@@ ger .
speak ye un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lam@@ b , according to the house of their fa@@ thers , a lam@@ b for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lam@@ b , let him and his neighbour next un@@ to his house take it according to the number of the so@@ ul@@ s ; every man according to his e@@ ating shall make your count for the lam@@ b .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the up@@ per door post of the houses , where@@ in they shall eat it .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remain@@ eth of it until the morning ye shall bur@@ n with fire .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will sm@@ ite all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and be@@ ast ; and against all the go@@ ds of Egypt I will exec@@ ute judgment : I am the Lord .
seven days shall ye eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away le@@ av@@ en out of your houses : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever e@@ ate@@ th le@@ av@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation , and in the seventh day there shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this sel@@ f@@ same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
seven days shall there be no le@@ av@@ en found in your houses : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever e@@ ate@@ th that which is le@@ av@@ ened , even that sou@@ l shall be cut off from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , whether he be a st@@ ran@@ ger , or born in the land .
and ye shall take a bun@@ ch of hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ on , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ on ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
for the Lord will pass through to sm@@ ite the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and when he se@@ eth the blood upon the lin@@ tel , and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destro@@ yer to come in un@@ to your houses to sm@@ ite you .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hat@@ h promised , that ye shall keep this service .
that ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lord 's pass@@ over , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smo@@ te the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and delivered our houses . and the people bo@@ wed the head and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smo@@ te all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ o@@ ah that sat on his th@@ r@@ one un@@ to the fir@@ st@@ born of the cap@@ tive that was in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of c@@ attle .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and the children of Israel did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and they borro@@ wed of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and ra@@ im@@ ent :
and they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not le@@ av@@ ened ; because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the sel@@ f@@ same day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed un@@ to the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
in one house shall it be e@@ aten ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not carry forth ought of the f@@ les@@ h abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone there@@ of .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Re@@ member this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place : there shall no le@@ av@@ ened bread be e@@ aten .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring the@@ e into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers to give the@@ e , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , that th@@ ou s@@ halt keep this service in this month .
and it shall be for a sign un@@ to the@@ e upon th@@ ine hand , and for a memorial between th@@ ine eyes , that the Lord 's law may be in TH@@ Y m@@ outh : for with a strong hand hat@@ h the Lord brought the@@ e out of Egypt .
that th@@ ou s@@ halt set apart un@@ to the Lord all that open@@ eth the mat@@ ri@@ x , and every fir@@ st@@ ling that co@@ me@@ th of a be@@ ast which th@@ ou h@@ ast ; the mal@@ es shall be the Lord 's .
and every fir@@ st@@ ling of an ass th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ de@@ em with a lam@@ b ; and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not re@@ de@@ em it , then th@@ ou s@@ halt break his nec@@ k : and all the fir@@ st@@ born of man among TH@@ Y children s@@ halt th@@ ou re@@ de@@ em .
but God led the people about , through the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up har@@ n@@ essed out of the land of Egypt .
and the Lord went before them by day in a pil@@ lar of a cl@@ oud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
and the Lord har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
and when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew n@@ igh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans mar@@ ched after them ; and they were sor@@ e afraid : and the children of Israel cri@@ ed out un@@ to the Lord .
is not this the word that we did tell the@@ e in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , than that we should die in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Fe@@ ar ye not , stand still , and see the sal@@ vation of the Lord , which he will she@@ w to you to day : for the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
but lift th@@ ou up TH@@ Y ro@@ d , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on d@@ ry ground through the mid@@ st of the sea .
and I , be@@ hold , I will har@@ den the hear@@ ts of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and upon all his host , upon his char@@ i@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ se@@ men .
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea d@@ ry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea upon the d@@ ry ground : and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked un@@ to the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans through the pil@@ lar of fire and of the cl@@ oud , and troubled the host of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
and Mos@@ es stret@@ ched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it ; and the Lord over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked upon d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the waters were a wall un@@ to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then san@@ g Mos@@ es and the children of Israel this song un@@ to the Lord , and sp@@ ake , saying , I will sing un@@ to the Lord , for he hat@@ h tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously : the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der hat@@ h he thrown into the sea .
fear and dre@@ ad shall fall upon them ; by the gre@@ at@@ ness of th@@ ine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; ti@@ ll TH@@ Y people pass over , O Lord , ti@@ ll the people pass over , which th@@ ou h@@ ast purchased .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , in the place , O Lord , which th@@ ou h@@ ast made for the@@ e to d@@ well in , in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , O Lord , which TH@@ Y hands have established .
for the hor@@ se of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h went in with his char@@ i@@ ots and with his hor@@ se@@ men into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea .
and they took their journey from E@@ lim , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel came un@@ to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , which is between E@@ lim and S@@ ina@@ i , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the second month after their depar@@ ting out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and it came to pass , as Aaron sp@@ ake un@@ to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared in the cl@@ oud .
and it came to pass , that at even the qu@@ ails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , be@@ hold , upon the face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness there lay a small round thing , as small as the ho@@ ar F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
this is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , G@@ ather of it every man according to his e@@ ating , an O@@ mer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his ten@@ ts .
and when they did M@@ ete it with an O@@ mer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to Mos@@ es ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and stan@@ k : and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with them .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for one man : and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation came and told Mos@@ es .
see , for that the Lord hat@@ h given you the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , therefore he gi@@ vet@@ h you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the children of Israel did eat man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat man@@ na , until they came un@@ to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , after their jour@@ neys , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , and pit@@ ched in Rep@@ hi@@ dim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
be@@ hold , I will stand before the@@ e there upon the rock in Ho@@ re@@ b ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Mos@@ es did so in the sight of the el@@ ders of Israel .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed : and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
when J@@ eth@@ ro , the pri@@ est of Mi@@ dian , Mos@@ es ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Mos@@ es , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and Mos@@ es went out to meet his father in law , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and k@@ is@@ sed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Mos@@ es told his father in law all that the Lord had done un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and J@@ eth@@ ro said , b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , who hat@@ h delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , who hat@@ h delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father in law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God : and Aaron came , and all the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father in law before God .
moreover th@@ ou s@@ halt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , h@@ ating c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and place such over them , to be rul@@ ers of thousands , and rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens :
and let them judge the people at all se@@ as@@ ons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring un@@ to the@@ e , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for th@@ y@@ self , and they shall bear the burden with the@@ e .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt do this thing , and God command the@@ e so , then th@@ ou s@@ halt be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
for they were depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and were come to the de@@ sert of S@@ ina@@ i , and had pit@@ ched in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel camp@@ ed before the mount .
and Mos@@ es went up un@@ to God , and the Lord called un@@ to him out of the mountain , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou say to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel ;
now therefore , if ye will obe@@ y my voice indeed , and keep my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , then ye shall be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure un@@ to me above all people : for all the ear@@ th is mine :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set bo@@ unds un@@ to the people round about , saying , T@@ ake heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth the mount shall be su@@ rely put to death :
and the Lord came down upon mount S@@ ina@@ i , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Mos@@ es up to the top of the mount ; and Mos@@ es went up .
and the Lord said un@@ to him , away , get the@@ e down , and th@@ ou s@@ halt come up , th@@ ou , and Aaron with the@@ e : but let not the pri@@ ests and the people break through to come up un@@ to the Lord , lest he break forth upon them .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make un@@ to the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
but the seventh day is the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath of the Lord TH@@ Y God : in it th@@ ou s@@ halt not do any work , th@@ ou , nor TH@@ Y son , nor TH@@ Y daughter , TH@@ Y man@@ ser@@ vant , nor TH@@ Y ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , nor TH@@ Y c@@ attle , nor TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ ger that is within TH@@ Y gates :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt not c@@ ov@@ et TH@@ Y neighbour 's wife , nor his man@@ ser@@ vant , nor his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , nor his o@@ x , nor his ass , nor any thing that is TH@@ Y neighbour 's .
and all the people saw the th@@ under@@ ings , and the ligh@@ t@@ nings , and the no@@ ise of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood af@@ ar off .
an alt@@ ar of ear@@ th th@@ ou s@@ halt make un@@ to me , and s@@ halt sacrifice there@@ on TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and TH@@ Y peace offer@@ ings , TH@@ Y she@@ ep , and th@@ ine ox@@ en : in all places where I record my name I will come un@@ to the@@ e , and I will b@@ less the@@ e .
and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t make me an alt@@ ar of stone , th@@ ou s@@ halt not build it of he@@ wn stone : for if th@@ ou lift up TH@@ Y tool upon it , th@@ ou h@@ ast pollu@@ ted it .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
if she ple@@ ase not her master , who hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her un@@ to a st@@ range nation he shall have no power , seeing he hat@@ h dealt dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully with her .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smo@@ te him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly he@@ aled .
or if it be known that the o@@ x hat@@ h used to push in time past , and his owner hat@@ h not kept him in ; he shall su@@ rely pay o@@ x for o@@ x ; and the dead shall be his own .
if fire break out , and catch in thor@@ ns , so that the st@@ acks of cor@@ n , or the standing cor@@ n , or the field , be consu@@ med there@@ with ; he that kin@@ d@@ led the fire shall su@@ rely make restitution .
if the th@@ i@@ ef be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought un@@ to the judges , to see whether he have put his hand un@@ to his neighbour 's goods .
then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both , that he hat@@ h not put his hand un@@ to his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept there@@ of , and he shall not make it good .
for that is his covering only , it is his ra@@ im@@ ent for his s@@ kin : where@@ in shall he sle@@ ep ? and it shall come to pass , when he cri@@ eth un@@ to me , that I will hear ; for I am gr@@ ac@@ ious .
and in all things that I have said un@@ to you be circum@@ sp@@ ect : and make no mention of the name of other go@@ ds , neither let it be heard out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt keep the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : ( th@@ ou s@@ halt eat un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days , as I comman@@ ded the@@ e , in the time appointed of the month A@@ bi@@ b ; for in it th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st out from Egypt : and none shall appear before me empty : )
for mine Angel shall go before the@@ e , and bring the@@ e in un@@ to the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites : and I will cut them off .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall b@@ less TH@@ Y bread , and TH@@ Y water ; and I will take si@@ ck@@ ness away from the mid@@ st of the@@ e .
I will send my fear before the@@ e , and will destroy all the people to whom th@@ ou s@@ halt come , and I will make all th@@ ine enem@@ ies turn their backs un@@ to the@@ e .
and I will set TH@@ Y bo@@ unds from the Red sea even un@@ to the sea of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from the de@@ sert un@@ to the river : for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt drive them out before the@@ e .
and Mos@@ es came and told the people all the words of the Lord , and all the judg@@ ments : and all the people answ@@ ered with one voice , and said , All the words which the Lord hat@@ h said will we do .
and they saw the God of Israel : and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , and as it were the body of heav@@ en in his clear@@ ness .
and the sight of the gl@@ ory of the Lord was like dev@@ our@@ ing fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel .
and Mos@@ es went into the mid@@ st of the cl@@ oud , and g@@ at him up into the mount : and Mos@@ es was in the mount for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights .
according to all that I she@@ w the@@ e , after the pat@@ tern of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the pat@@ tern of all the instruments there@@ of , even so shall ye make it .
and they shall make an Ar@@ k of sh@@ it@@ tim wood : two cu@@ bi@@ ts and a half shall be the length there@@ of , and a cu@@ bit and a half the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of , and a cu@@ bit and a half the he@@ ight there@@ of .

and there shall be a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , and a K@@ no@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the cand@@ le@@ stick .

and the re@@ mn@@ ant that remain@@ eth of the cur@@ tains of the tent , the half cur@@ tain that remain@@ eth , shall han@@ g over the back@@ side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and a cu@@ bit on the one side , and a cu@@ bit on the other side of that which remain@@ eth in the length of the cur@@ tains of the tent , it shall han@@ g over the sides of the tab@@ ern@@ acle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay the boards with gold , and make their r@@ ings of gold for places for the bars : and th@@ ou s@@ halt over@@ lay the bars with gold .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt han@@ g up the v@@ ail under the t@@ aches , that th@@ ou may@@ est bring in th@@ ither within the v@@ ail the Ar@@ k of the testimony : and the v@@ ail shall divide un@@ to you between the hol@@ y place and the most hol@@ y .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt set the table without the v@@ ail , and the cand@@ le@@ stick over against the table on the side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle toward the south : and th@@ ou s@@ halt put the table on the north side .

and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to all that are wise hear@@ ted , whom I have filled with the spirit of wis@@ dom , that they may make Aaron 's gar@@ ments to consec@@ rate him , that he may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .
and these are the gar@@ ments which they shall make ; a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and an ep@@ ho@@ d , and a ro@@ be , and a bro@@ i@@ dered co@@ at , a Mit@@ re , and a gir@@ dle : and they shall make hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron TH@@ Y brother , and his sons , that he may minister un@@ to me in the pri@@ est 's office .

and th@@ ou s@@ halt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and s@@ halt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .

and th@@ ou s@@ halt put it before the v@@ ail that is by the Ar@@ k of the testimony , before the mer@@ cy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with the@@ e .
and Aaron shall make an At@@ on@@ ement upon the hor@@ ns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of at@@ on@@ ements : once in the year shall he make At@@ on@@ ement upon it throughout your generations : it is most hol@@ y un@@ to the Lord .
when th@@ ou tak@@ est the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ran@@ so@@ m for his sou@@ l un@@ to the Lord , when th@@ ou num@@ ber@@ est them ; that there be no pla@@ gue among them , when th@@ ou num@@ ber@@ est them .
this they shall give , every one that pass@@ eth among them that are num@@ ber@@ ed , half a sh@@ ek@@ el after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary : ( a sh@@ ek@@ el is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s : ) an half sh@@ ek@@ el shall be the offering of the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a sh@@ ek@@ el , when they give an offering un@@ to the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for your so@@ ul@@ s .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt also make a lav@@ er of br@@ ass , and his fo@@ ot also of br@@ ass , to was@@ h with@@ al : and th@@ ou s@@ halt put it between the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation and the alt@@ ar , and th@@ ou s@@ halt put water there@@ in .

upon man 's f@@ les@@ h shall it not be p@@ oured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is hol@@ y , and it shall be hol@@ y un@@ to you .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , where I will meet with the@@ e : it shall be un@@ to you most hol@@ y .
and as for the perf@@ ume which th@@ ou s@@ halt make , ye shall not make to yo@@ ur@@ selves according to the composition there@@ of : it shall be un@@ to the@@ e hol@@ y for the Lord .
and I , be@@ hold , I have given with him Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan : and in the hear@@ ts of all that are wise hear@@ ted I have put wis@@ dom , that they may make all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e ;
and the clo@@ ths of service , and the hol@@ y gar@@ ments for Aaron the pri@@ est , and the gar@@ ments of his sons , to minister in the pri@@ est 's office ,
Y@@ e shall keep the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath therefore ; for it is hol@@ y un@@ to you : every one that def@@ il@@ eth it shall su@@ rely be put to death : for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth any work there@@ in , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath of rest , hol@@ y to the Lord : wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever do@@ eth any work in the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , he shall su@@ rely be put to death .
and Aaron said un@@ to them , Bre@@ ak off the golden ear@@ r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them un@@ to me .
and he received them at their hand , and fas@@ hi@@ oned it with a gra@@ ving tool , after he had made it a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : and they said , These be TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Israel , which brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I comman@@ ded them : they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shi@@ pped it , and have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed there@@ un@@ to , and said , These be TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Israel , which have brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
and Mos@@ es bes@@ ought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why do@@ th TH@@ Y wr@@ ath wa@@ x hot against TH@@ Y people , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore should the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans speak , and say , For mis@@ chief did he bring them out , to s@@ lay them in the mountains , and to consum@@ e them from the face of the ear@@ th ? turn from TH@@ Y fierce wr@@ ath , and rep@@ ent of this ev@@ il against TH@@ Y people .
and Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that sh@@ out for mas@@ tery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the no@@ ise of them that sing do I hear .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came n@@ igh un@@ to the camp , that he saw the cal@@ f , and the dan@@ cing : and Mos@@ es ' an@@ ger wa@@ xed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and br@@ ake them ben@@ e@@ ath the mount .
and he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and bur@@ n@@ t it in the fire , and ground it to pow@@ der , and stra@@ wed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said un@@ to me , Mak@@ e us go@@ ds , which shall go before us : for as for this Mos@@ es , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wo@@ t not what is become of him .
then Mos@@ es stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Wh@@ o is on the Lord 's side ? let him come un@@ to me . and all the sons of L@@ evi gathered themselves together un@@ to him .
and he said un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , P@@ ut every man his s@@ word by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and s@@ lay every man his brother , and every man his compan@@ ion , and every man his neighbour .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Mos@@ es said un@@ to the people , Y@@ e have sin@@ ned a great sin : and now I will go up un@@ to the Lord ; per@@ ad@@ venture I shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for your sin .
yet now , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t for@@ give their sin@@ -- ; and if not , blo@@ t me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of TH@@ Y book which th@@ ou h@@ ast written .
therefore now go , lead the people un@@ to the place of which I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : be@@ hold , mine Angel shall go before the@@ e : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , de@@ part , and go up hence , th@@ ou and the people which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought up out of the land of Egypt , un@@ to the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed will I give it :
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es went out un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Mos@@ es , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Mos@@ es entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar des@@ cen@@ ded , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the Lord talked with Mos@@ es .
and all the people saw the cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar stand at the tab@@ ern@@ acle door : and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ pped , every man in his tent door .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es face to face , as a man speak@@ eth un@@ to his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his ser@@ vant Jos@@ hua , the son of nun , a young man , depar@@ ted not out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , if I have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , she@@ w me now TH@@ Y way , that I may know the@@ e , that I may find grace in TH@@ Y sight : and consider that this nation is TH@@ Y people .
and he said , I will make all my Go@@ od@@ ness pass before the@@ e , and I will procla@@ im the name of the Lord before the@@ e ; and will be gr@@ ac@@ ious to whom I will be gr@@ ac@@ ious , and will she@@ w mer@@ cy on whom I will she@@ w mer@@ cy .
and it shall come to pass , while my gl@@ ory pass@@ eth by , that I will put the@@ e in a cli@@ ft of the rock , and will cover the@@ e with my hand while I pass by :
and he he@@ wed two tables of stone like un@@ to the first ; and Mos@@ es rose up early in the morning , and went up un@@ to mount S@@ ina@@ i , as the Lord had comman@@ ded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
observe th@@ ou that which I command the@@ e this day : be@@ hold , I drive out before the@@ e the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the H@@ iv@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
take heed to th@@ y@@ self , lest th@@ ou make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e :
and th@@ ou take of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to TH@@ Y sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds , and make TH@@ Y sons go a wh@@ oring after their go@@ ds .
for I will cast out the nations before the@@ e , and en@@ large TH@@ Y borders : neither shall any man desire TH@@ Y land , when th@@ ou s@@ halt go up to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God th@@ ri@@ ce in the year .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es came down from mount S@@ ina@@ i with the two tables of testimony in Mos@@ es ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Mos@@ es w@@ ist not that the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one while he talked with him .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come n@@ igh him .
but when Mos@@ es went in before the Lord to speak with him , he took the v@@ ail off , until he came out . and he came out , and sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel that which he was comman@@ ded .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Mos@@ es , that the s@@ kin of Mos@@ es ' face sh@@ one : and Mos@@ es put the v@@ ail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Mos@@ es gathered all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel together , and said un@@ to them , These are the words which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , that ye should do them .
and the incen@@ se alt@@ ar , and his st@@ aves , and the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and the swe@@ et incen@@ se , and the han@@ ging for the door at the entering in of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,

and they came , every one whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord 's offering to the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for all his service , and for the hol@@ y gar@@ ments .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and br@@ ass brought the Lord 's offering : and every man , with whom was found sh@@ it@@ tim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hear@@ ted did sp@@ in with their hands , and brought that which they had sp@@ un , both of blue , and of pur@@ ple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine lin@@ en .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering un@@ to the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had comman@@ ded to be made by the hand of Mos@@ es .
and he hat@@ h put in his heart that he may te@@ ach , both he , and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan .
and Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el and Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise hear@@ ted man , in whose heart the Lord had put wis@@ dom , even every one whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come un@@ to the work to do it :
and he made lo@@ ops of blue on the edge of one cur@@ tain from the sel@@ v@@ edge in the cou@@ pling : likewise he made in the ut@@ ter@@ most side of another cur@@ tain , in the cou@@ pling of the second .
fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in one cur@@ tain , and fif@@ ty lo@@ ops made he in the edge of the cur@@ tain which was in the cou@@ pling of the second : the lo@@ ops held one cur@@ tain to another .

and he made two ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mer@@ cy seat ;
one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b on the end on this side , and another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b on the other end on that side : out of the mer@@ cy seat made he the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the two ends there@@ of .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms spread out their w@@ ings on high , and covered with their w@@ ings over the mer@@ cy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mer@@ cy se@@ at@@ ward were the faces of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dis@@ hes , and his sp@@ o@@ ons , and his bo@@ w@@ ls , and his covers to cover with@@ al , of p@@ ure gold .

and for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were han@@ g@@ ings of fif@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts ; their pil@@ lars three , and their so@@ c@@ kets three .
and the so@@ c@@ kets for the pil@@ lars were of br@@ ass ; the ho@@ oks of the pil@@ lars and their fil@@ lets of silver ; and the over@@ lay@@ ing of their chap@@ it@@ ers of silver ; and all the pil@@ lars of the court were fil@@ le@@ ted with silver .
and the han@@ ging for the gate of the court was ne@@ ed@@ le@@ work , of blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en : and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length , and the he@@ ight in the b@@ read@@ th was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , answ@@ er@@ able to the han@@ g@@ ings of the court .
this is the sum of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , by the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , son to Aaron the pri@@ est .
and with him was Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ a@@ b , son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tri@@ be of Dan , an en@@ gra@@ ver , and a c@@ un@@ ning work@@ man , and an em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ er in blue , and in pur@@ ple , and in scar@@ let , and fine lin@@ en .
all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the hol@@ y place , even the gold of the offering , was twenty and nine tal@@ ents , and seven hundred and thirty sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
and the silver of them that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the Con@@ gre@@ gation was an hundred tal@@ ents , and a thousand seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and fif@@ teen sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :
and they did beat the gold into th@@ in plates , and cut it into wi@@ res , to work it in the blue , and in the pur@@ ple , and in the scar@@ let , and in the fine lin@@ en , with c@@ un@@ ning work .
and the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of his ep@@ ho@@ d , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work there@@ of ; of gold , blue , and pur@@ ple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined lin@@ en ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and he put them on the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the ep@@ ho@@ d , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , every one with his name , according to the twelve tri@@ bes .
and they made two r@@ ings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ep@@ ho@@ d in@@ ward .
and they made two other golden r@@ ings , and put them on the two sides of the ep@@ ho@@ d under@@ ne@@ ath , toward the fore@@ part of it , over against the other cou@@ pling there@@ of , above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d .
and they did bin@@ d the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te by his r@@ ings un@@ to the r@@ ings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a la@@ ce of blue , that it might be above the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te might not be lo@@ os@@ ed from the ep@@ ho@@ d ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and there was an hol@@ e in the mid@@ st of the ro@@ be , as the hol@@ e of an haber@@ ge@@ on , with a band round about the hol@@ e , that it should not ren@@ d .
and they made the pla@@ te of the hol@@ y cro@@ wn of p@@ ure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the en@@ gra@@ v@@ ings of a sig@@ net , H@@ OL@@ IN@@ ESS TO the Lord .
and Mos@@ es did look upon all the work , and , be@@ hold , they have done it as the Lord had comman@@ ded , even so had they done it : and Mos@@ es b@@ les@@ sed them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring in the cand@@ le@@ stick , and light the lam@@ ps there@@ of .

and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up .
and Mos@@ es re@@ ar@@ ed up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and fas@@ tened his so@@ c@@ kets , and set up the boards there@@ of , and put in the bars there@@ of , and re@@ ar@@ ed up his pil@@ lars .

and he put the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering by the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the tent of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and offered upon it the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the meat offering ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
for the cl@@ oud of the Lord was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their jour@@ neys .

wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall touch the f@@ les@@ h there@@ of shall be hol@@ y : and when there is sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led of the blood there@@ of upon any gar@@ ment , th@@ ou s@@ halt was@@ h that where@@ on it was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led in the hol@@ y place .
and no sin offering , where@@ of any of the blood is brought into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation to reconc@@ ile with@@ al in the hol@@ y place , shall be e@@ aten : it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the fire .
and the pri@@ est that offer@@ eth any man 's bur@@ n@@ t offering , even the pri@@ est shall have to himself the s@@ kin of the bur@@ n@@ t offering which he hat@@ h offered .
and all the meat offering that is bak@@ en in the ov@@ en , and all that is d@@ ressed in the f@@ ry@@ ing@@ pan , and in the pan , shall be the pri@@ est 's that offer@@ eth it .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole ob@@ lation for an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord , and it shall be the pri@@ est 's that sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le@@ th the blood of the peace offer@@ ings .
and the f@@ les@@ h of the sacrifice of his peace offer@@ ings for Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving shall be e@@ aten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
and if any of the f@@ les@@ h of the sacrifice of his peace offer@@ ings be e@@ aten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , neither shall it be imp@@ uted un@@ to him that offer@@ eth it : it shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation , and the sou@@ l that e@@ ate@@ th of it shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but the sou@@ l that e@@ ate@@ th of the f@@ les@@ h of the sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings , that per@@ tain un@@ to the Lord , having his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess upon him , even that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people .
and the f@@ at of the be@@ ast that di@@ eth of itself , and the f@@ at of that which is torn with be@@ asts , may be used in any other use : but ye shall in no wise eat of it .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever e@@ ate@@ th the f@@ at of the be@@ ast , of which men offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord , even the sou@@ l that e@@ ate@@ th it shall be cut off from his people .
his own hands shall bring the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , the f@@ at with the bre@@ ast , it shall he bring , that the bre@@ ast may be w@@ av@@ ed for a wave offering before the Lord .
for the wave bre@@ ast and the he@@ ave sho@@ ul@@ der have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of their peace offer@@ ings , and have given them un@@ to Aaron the pri@@ est and un@@ to his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel .
this is the portion of the ano@@ in@@ ting of Aaron , and of the ano@@ in@@ ting of his sons , out of the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister un@@ to the Lord in the pri@@ est 's office ;
this is the law of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and of the consec@@ r@@ ations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings ;
and he put upon him the co@@ at , and gir@@ ded him with the gir@@ dle , and clo@@ th@@ ed him with the ro@@ be , and put the ep@@ ho@@ d upon him , and he gir@@ ded him with the cur@@ ious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and bound it un@@ to him there@@ with .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Mos@@ es took the blood , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar round about with his fin@@ ger , and pur@@ ified the alt@@ ar , and p@@ oured the blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he took all the f@@ at that was upon the in@@ wards , and ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and their f@@ at , and Mos@@ es burned it upon the alt@@ ar .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Mos@@ es took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right e@@ ar , and upon the thum@@ b of his right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of his right fo@@ ot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Mos@@ es put of the blood upon the tip of their right e@@ ar , and upon the thum@@ bs of their right hands , and upon the great to@@ es of their right feet : and Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar round about .
and he took the f@@ at , and the rum@@ p , and all the f@@ at that was upon the in@@ wards , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver , and the two kid@@ neys , and their f@@ at , and the right sho@@ ul@@ der :
and out of the bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , that was before the Lord , he took one un@@ le@@ av@@ ened c@@ ake , and a c@@ ake of o@@ iled bread , and one w@@ af@@ er , and put them on the f@@ at , and upon the right sho@@ ul@@ der :
and Mos@@ es took them from off their hands , and bur@@ n@@ t them on the alt@@ ar upon the bur@@ n@@ t offering : they were consec@@ r@@ ations for a swe@@ et sav@@ our : it is an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and Mos@@ es took of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and of the blood which was upon the alt@@ ar , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it upon Aaron , and upon his gar@@ ments , and upon his sons , and upon his sons ' gar@@ ments with him ; and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Aaron , and his gar@@ ments , and his sons , and his sons ' gar@@ ments with him .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation in seven days , until the days of your consec@@ ration be at an end : for seven days shall he consec@@ rate you .
and un@@ to the children of Israel th@@ ou s@@ halt speak , saying , T@@ ake ye a k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering ; and a cal@@ f and a lam@@ b , both of the first year , without ble@@ mis@@ h , for a bur@@ n@@ t offering ;
and the sons of Aaron brought the blood un@@ to him : and he di@@ pped his fin@@ ger in the blood , and put it upon the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar , and p@@ oured out the blood at the bottom of the alt@@ ar :
and the f@@ at of the bul@@ lock and of the ram , the rum@@ p , and that which cover@@ eth the in@@ wards , and the kid@@ neys , and the ca@@ ul above the li@@ ver :
and Nad@@ a@@ b and A@@ bi@@ hu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his cen@@ ser , and put fire there@@ in , and put incen@@ se there@@ on , and offered st@@ range fire before the Lord , which he comman@@ ded them not .
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , lest ye die : for the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of the Lord is upon you . and they did according to the word of Mos@@ es .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to Ele@@ azar and un@@ to I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , his sons that were left , T@@ ake the meat offering that remain@@ eth of the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , and eat it without le@@ av@@ en bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar : for it is most hol@@ y :
and ye shall eat it in the hol@@ y place , because it is TH@@ Y due , and TH@@ Y sons ' due , of the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of the Lord made by fire : for so I am comman@@ ded .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that ch@@ ew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the ho@@ of : as the C@@ ame@@ l , because he che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ de@@ th not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean un@@ to you .
and all that have not fin@@ s and scal@@ es in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to you :
and these are they which ye shall have in ab@@ omin@@ ation among the fo@@ w@@ ls ; they shall not be e@@ aten , they are an ab@@ omin@@ ation : the e@@ ag@@ le , and the os@@ si@@ fra@@ ge , and the os@@ pra@@ y ,
yet these may ye eat of every flying cre@@ eping thing that go@@ eth upon all four , which have leg@@ s above their feet , to le@@ ap with@@ al upon the ear@@ th ;
even these of them ye may eat ; the loc@@ ust after his kind , and the bal@@ d loc@@ ust after his kind , and the be@@ etle after his kind , and the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ per after his kind .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon his pa@@ ws , among all manner of be@@ asts that go on all four , those are un@@ clean un@@ to you : wh@@ os@@ o tou@@ ch@@ eth their car@@ case shall be un@@ clean until the even .

and he that e@@ ate@@ th of the car@@ case of it shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even : he also that be@@ aret@@ h the car@@ case of it shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon the bel@@ ly , and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever go@@ eth upon all four , or wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever hat@@ h more feet among all cre@@ eping things that cre@@ ep upon the ear@@ th , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
Y@@ e shall not make yo@@ ur@@ selves ab@@ omin@@ able with any cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth , neither shall ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ clean with them , that ye should be def@@ iled there@@ by .
for I am the Lord your God : ye shall therefore sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , and ye shall be hol@@ y ; for I am hol@@ y : neither shall ye def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with any manner of cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the ear@@ th .
for I am the Lord that br@@ ing@@ eth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be hol@@ y , for I am hol@@ y .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conce@@ ived se@@ ed , and born a man child : then she shall be un@@ clean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her in@@ fir@@ mity shall she be un@@ clean .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an At@@ on@@ ement for her ; and she shall be cleans@@ ed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hat@@ h born a male or a female .
when a man shall have in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h a rising , a sc@@ a@@ b , or a bright spot , and it be in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h like the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy ; then he shall be brought un@@ to Aaron the pri@@ est , or un@@ to one of his sons the pri@@ ests :

if the bright spot be white in the s@@ kin of his f@@ les@@ h , and in sight be not deeper than the s@@ kin , and the ha@@ ir there@@ of be not turned white ; then the pri@@ est shall shut up him that hat@@ h the pla@@ gue seven days :

and the pri@@ est shall look on him again the seventh day : and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue be somewhat dark , and the pla@@ gue spread not in the s@@ kin , the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean : it is but a sc@@ a@@ b : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be clean .
but if the sc@@ a@@ b spread much abroad in the s@@ kin , after that he hat@@ h been seen of the pri@@ est for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the pri@@ est again :
and the pri@@ est shall see him : and , be@@ hold , if the rising be white in the s@@ kin , and it have turned the ha@@ ir white , and there be quick raw f@@ les@@ h in the rising ;

and if , when the pri@@ est se@@ eth it , be@@ hold , it be in sight lower than the s@@ kin , and the ha@@ ir there@@ of be turned white ; the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him un@@ clean : it is a pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy broken out of the bo@@ il .
but if the pri@@ est look on it , and , be@@ hold , there be no white ha@@ ir@@ s there@@ in , and if it be not lower than the s@@ kin , but be somewhat dark ; then the pri@@ est shall shut him up seven days :
but if the pri@@ est look on it , and , be@@ hold , there be no white ha@@ ir in the bright spot , and it be no lower than the other s@@ kin , but be somewhat dark ; then the pri@@ est shall shut him up seven days :
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the s@@ kin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean : for it is an inf@@ lam@@ mation of the burning .
and if the pri@@ est look on the pla@@ gue of the sc@@ all , and , be@@ hold , it be not in sight deeper than the s@@ kin , and that there is no black ha@@ ir in it ; then the pri@@ est shall shut up him that hat@@ h the pla@@ gue of the sc@@ all seven days :

and in the seventh day the pri@@ est shall look on the sc@@ all : and , be@@ hold , if the sc@@ all be not spread in the s@@ kin , nor be in sight deeper than the s@@ kin ; then the pri@@ est shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be clean .

and he that hat@@ h his ha@@ ir fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is fore@@ head bal@@ d : yet is he clean .
then the pri@@ est shall look upon it : and , be@@ hold , if the rising of the sor@@ e be white red@@ dish in his bal@@ d head , or in his bal@@ d fore@@ head , as the le@@ pro@@ sy appe@@ aret@@ h in the s@@ kin of the f@@ les@@ h ;
and if the pla@@ gue be green@@ ish or red@@ dish in the gar@@ ment , or in the s@@ kin , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of s@@ kin ; it is a pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , and shall be she@@ wed un@@ to the pri@@ est :

he shall therefore bur@@ n that gar@@ ment , whether war@@ p or wo@@ of , in wo@@ ol@@ len or in lin@@ en , or any thing of s@@ kin , where@@ in the pla@@ gue is : for it is a fre@@ t@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy ; it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the fire .

and the pri@@ est shall go forth out of the camp ; and the pri@@ est shall look , and , be@@ hold , if the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy be he@@ aled in the le@@ per ;
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the c@@ ed@@ ar wood , and the scar@@ let , and the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
and he shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le upon him that is to be cleans@@ ed from the le@@ pro@@ sy seven times , and shall pron@@ oun@@ ce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and he that is to be cleans@@ ed shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and s@@ have off all his ha@@ ir , and was@@ h himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tar@@ ry abroad out of his tent seven days .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall s@@ have all his ha@@ ir off his head and his be@@ ard and his eye@@ bro@@ ws , even all his ha@@ ir he shall s@@ have off : and he shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , also he shall was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h in water , and he shall be clean .
and the pri@@ est that mak@@ eth him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and he shall s@@ lay the lam@@ b in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the bur@@ n@@ t offering , in the hol@@ y place : for as the sin offering is the pri@@ est 's , so is the t@@ res@@ pass offering : it is most hol@@ y :
and the pri@@ est shall take some of the blood of the t@@ res@@ pass offering , and the pri@@ est shall put it upon the tip of the right e@@ ar of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , and upon the thum@@ b of his right hand , and upon the great to@@ e of his right fo@@ ot :

when ye be come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy in a house of the land of your possession ;
then the pri@@ est shall command that they empty the house , before the pri@@ est go into it to see the pla@@ gue , that all that is in the house be not made un@@ clean : and after@@ ward the pri@@ est shall go in to see the house :

speak un@@ to Aaron , and un@@ to his sons , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them ; This is the thing which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying ,
what man so@@ ever there be of the house of Israel , that kil@@ le@@ th an o@@ x , or lam@@ b , or go@@ at , in the camp , or that kil@@ le@@ th it out of the camp ,
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer an offering un@@ to the Lord before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; blood shall be imp@@ uted un@@ to that man ; he hat@@ h shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them un@@ to the Lord , un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , un@@ to the pri@@ est , and offer them for peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord .
and br@@ ing@@ eth it not un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to offer it un@@ to the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n among you , that e@@ ate@@ th any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that sou@@ l that e@@ ate@@ th blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
for the life of the f@@ les@@ h is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the alt@@ ar to make an At@@ on@@ ement for your so@@ ul@@ s : for it is the blood that mak@@ eth an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n among you , which hun@@ te@@ th and cat@@ ch@@ eth any be@@ ast or fo@@ w@@ l that may be e@@ aten ; he shall even p@@ our out the blood there@@ of , and cover it with d@@ ust .
after the do@@ ings of the land of Egypt , where@@ in ye d@@ wel@@ t , shall ye not do : and after the do@@ ings of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , w@@ hi@@ ther I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ord@@ inan@@ ces .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordin@@ ance , that ye commit not any one of these ab@@ omin@@ able customs , which were committed before you , and that ye def@@ ile not yo@@ ur@@ selves there@@ in : I am the Lord your God .
therefore every one that e@@ ate@@ th it shall bear his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because he hat@@ h prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ low@@ ed thing of the Lord : and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not wh@@ ol@@ ly re@@ ap the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather the g@@ le@@ an@@ ings of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est .
Y@@ e shall do no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness in judgment : th@@ ou s@@ halt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the m@@ igh@@ ty : but in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness s@@ halt th@@ ou judge TH@@ Y neighbour .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever li@@ eth car@@ n@@ ally with a woman , that is a bon@@ d@@ ma@@ id , bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed to an husband , and not at all re@@ deemed , nor freedom given her ; she shall be s@@ cour@@ ged ; they shall not be put to death , because she was not free .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for him with the ram of the t@@ res@@ pass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hat@@ h done : and the sin which he hat@@ h done shall be for@@ given him .
and when ye shall come into the land , and shall have plan@@ ted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit there@@ of as un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised : three years shall it be as un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised un@@ to you : it shall not be e@@ aten of .
but the st@@ ran@@ ger that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th with you shall be un@@ to you as one born among you , and th@@ ou s@@ halt love him as th@@ y@@ self ; for ye were st@@ ran@@ gers in the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
just balan@@ ces , just we@@ ights , a just ep@@ ha@@ h , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
again , th@@ ou s@@ halt say to the children of Israel , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be of the children of Israel , or of the st@@ ran@@ gers that so@@ jour@@ n in Israel , that gi@@ vet@@ h any of his se@@ ed un@@ to Mo@@ le@@ ch ; he shall su@@ rely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
and I will set my face against that man , and will cut him off from among his people ; because he hat@@ h given of his se@@ ed un@@ to Mo@@ le@@ ch , to def@@ ile my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name .
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a wh@@ oring after him , to commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with Mo@@ le@@ ch , from among their people .
and the sou@@ l that tur@@ net@@ h after such as have familiar spir@@ its , and after w@@ iz@@ ards , to go a wh@@ oring after them , I will even set my face against that sou@@ l , and will cut him off from among his people .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall su@@ rely be put to death : they have w@@ rought conf@@ usion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with man@@ kind , as he li@@ eth with a woman , both of them have committed an ab@@ omin@@ ation : they shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a woman approach un@@ to any be@@ ast , and lie down there@@ to , th@@ ou s@@ halt kill the woman , and the be@@ ast : they shall su@@ rely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her si@@ ck@@ ness , and shall un@@ cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; he hat@@ h discovered her fo@@ un@@ tain , and she hat@@ h uncovered the fo@@ un@@ tain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
but I have said un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall inher@@ it their land , and I will give it un@@ to you to poss@@ ess it , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey : I am the Lord your God , which have separated you from other people .
Y@@ e shall therefore put difference between clean be@@ asts and un@@ clean , and between un@@ clean fo@@ w@@ ls and clean : and ye shall not make your so@@ ul@@ s ab@@ omin@@ able by be@@ ast , or by fo@@ w@@ l , or by any manner of living thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth on the ground , which I have separated from you as un@@ clean .
and for his sister a vir@@ gin , that is n@@ igh un@@ to him , which hat@@ h had no husband ; for her may he be def@@ iled .
they shall be hol@@ y un@@ to their God , and not prof@@ ane the name of their God : for the offer@@ ings of the Lord made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be hol@@ y .
they shall not take a wife that is a wh@@ ore , or prof@@ ane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is hol@@ y un@@ to his God .
and he that is the high pri@@ est among his bre@@ th@@ ren , upon whose head the ano@@ in@@ ting oil was p@@ oured , and that is consec@@ rated to put on the gar@@ ments , shall not un@@ cover his head , nor ren@@ d his clo@@ th@@ es ;
neither shall he go out of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , nor prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of his God ; for the cro@@ wn of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever man he be that hat@@ h a ble@@ mis@@ h , he shall not approach : a b@@ lin@@ d man , or a la@@ me , or he that hat@@ h a flat n@@ ose , or any thing super@@ f@@ lu@@ ous ,

speak un@@ to Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the hol@@ y things of the children of Israel , and that they prof@@ ane not my hol@@ y name in those things which they hal@@ low un@@ to me : I am the Lord .
say un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be of all your se@@ ed among your generations , that go@@ eth un@@ to the hol@@ y things , which the children of Israel hal@@ low un@@ to the Lord , having his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess upon him , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from my presence : I am the Lord .
the sou@@ l which hat@@ h touched any such shall be un@@ clean until even , and shall not eat of the hol@@ y things , unless he was@@ h his f@@ les@@ h with water .
but if the pri@@ est buy any sou@@ l with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
and if a man eat of the hol@@ y thing un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , then he shall put the fifth part there@@ of un@@ to it , and shall give it un@@ to the pri@@ est with the hol@@ y thing .
neither from a st@@ ran@@ ger 's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and ble@@ mis@@ hes be in them : they shall not be accepted for you .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye be come into the land which I give un@@ to you , and shall re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est there@@ of , then ye shall bring a she@@ af of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of your har@@ v@@ est un@@ to the pri@@ est :
and ye shall count un@@ to you from the mor@@ row after the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , from the day that ye brought the she@@ af of the wave offering ; seven sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths shall be complete :

and ye shall procla@@ im on the sel@@ f@@ same day , that it may be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in : it shall be a statute for ever in all your d@@ wel@@ lings throughout your generations .
and when ye re@@ ap the har@@ v@@ est of your land , th@@ ou s@@ halt not make clean rid@@ dance of the cor@@ ners of TH@@ Y field when th@@ ou re@@ ap@@ est , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou gather any g@@ le@@ an@@ ing of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est : th@@ ou s@@ halt leave them un@@ to the poor , and to the st@@ ran@@ ger : I am the Lord your God .
also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of At@@ on@@ ement : it shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you ; and ye shall aff@@ lic@@ t your so@@ ul@@ s , and offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of At@@ on@@ ement , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for you before the Lord your God .
for wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever sou@@ l it be that shall not be aff@@ lic@@ ted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : on the eighth day shall be an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation un@@ to you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire un@@ to the Lord : it is a so@@ lem@@ n assembly ; and ye shall do no serv@@ ile work there@@ in .
also in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast un@@ to the Lord seven days : on the first day shall be a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and on the eighth day shall be a sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and ye shall take you on the first day the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of good@@ ly trees , branches of pal@@ m trees , and the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of th@@ ick trees , and w@@ il@@ lows of the Bro@@ ok ; and ye shall re@@ jo@@ ice before the Lord your God seven days .
and the son of an Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman and a man of Israel stro@@ ve together in the camp ;
and the Isra@@ el@@ iti@@ sh woman 's son b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the name of the Lord , and Cur@@ sed . and they brought him un@@ to Mos@@ es : ( and his mother 's name was S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith , the daughter of Di@@ br@@ i , of the tri@@ be of Dan : )
and he that b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ th the name of the Lord , he shall su@@ rely be put to death , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall certainly stone him : as well the st@@ ran@@ ger , as he that is born in the land , when he b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ th the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
that which grow@@ eth of its own accord of TH@@ Y har@@ v@@ est th@@ ou s@@ halt not re@@ ap , neither gather the grap@@ es of TH@@ Y v@@ ine und@@ ressed : for it is a year of rest un@@ to the land .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the tr@@ ump@@ et of the j@@ ub@@ ile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of At@@ on@@ ement shall ye make the tr@@ ump@@ et sound throughout all your land .
and ye shall hal@@ low the fif@@ ti@@ eth year , and procla@@ im liber@@ ty throughout all the land un@@ to all the inhabitants there@@ of : it shall be a j@@ ub@@ ile un@@ to you ; and ye shall return every man un@@ to his possession , and ye shall return every man un@@ to his family .
according to the multi@@ tude of years th@@ ou s@@ halt increase the price there@@ of , and according to the fe@@ w@@ ness of years th@@ ou s@@ halt dimin@@ ish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fru@@ its do@@ th he sell un@@ to the@@ e .
and ye shall so@@ w the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fru@@ its come in ye shall eat of the old store .
if TH@@ Y brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and hat@@ h sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to re@@ de@@ em it , then shall he re@@ de@@ em that which his brother sold .
and if a man purchase of the L@@ evi@@ tes , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of j@@ ub@@ ile : for the houses of the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes are their possession among the children of Israel .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and to be your God .
and then shall he de@@ part from the@@ e , both he and his children with him , and shall return un@@ to his own family , and un@@ to the possession of his fa@@ thers shall he return .
both TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ men , and TH@@ Y bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , shall be of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bon@@ d@@ men and bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids .
moreover of the children of the st@@ ran@@ gers that do so@@ jour@@ n among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they beg@@ at in your land : and they shall be your possession .
and ye shall take them as an inher@@ it@@ ance for your children after you , to inher@@ it them for a possession ; they shall be your bon@@ d@@ men for ever : but over your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with ri@@ g@@ our .
and if there remain but few years un@@ to the year of j@@ ub@@ ile , then he shall count with him , and according un@@ to his years shall he give him again the price of his re@@ dem@@ ption .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid ev@@ il be@@ asts out of the land , neither shall the s@@ word go through your land .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bon@@ d@@ men ; and I have broken the bands of your yok@@ e , and made you go u@@ pri@@ ght .
and if ye shall desp@@ ise my stat@@ utes , or if your sou@@ l ab@@ h@@ or my judg@@ ments , so that ye will not do all my comman@@ d@@ ments , but that ye break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and I will set my face against you , and ye shall be sla@@ in before your enem@@ ies : they that h@@ ate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursu@@ eth you .
and your strength shall be spent in v@@ ain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fru@@ its .
I will also send wild be@@ asts among you , which shall ro@@ b you of your children , and destroy your c@@ attle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be de@@ so@@ late .
and I will bring a s@@ word upon you , that shall av@@ en@@ ge the quar@@ rel of my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bak@@ e your bread in one ov@@ en , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a s@@ word , when none pursu@@ eth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enem@@ ies .
and they that are left of you shall p@@ ine away in their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity in your enem@@ ies ' lands ; and also in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fa@@ thers shall they p@@ ine away with them .
and that I also have walked contrary un@@ to them , and have brought them into the land of their enem@@ ies ; if then their un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised hear@@ ts be hum@@ b@@ led , and they then accept of the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity :
the land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , while she li@@ eth de@@ so@@ late without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : because , even because they desp@@ ised my judg@@ ments , and because their sou@@ l ab@@ hor@@ red my stat@@ utes .
and TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be of the male from twenty years old even un@@ to six@@ ty years old , even TH@@ Y esti@@ mation shall be fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .

in the year of the j@@ ub@@ ile the field shall return un@@ to him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .

and all the fir@@ st@@ born mal@@ es by the number of names , from a month old and up@@ ward , of those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and thir@@ teen .
and for those that are to be re@@ deemed of the two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and thir@@ teen of the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel , which are more than the L@@ evi@@ tes ;
of the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and thre@@ es@@ core and five sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary :

this is the service of the families of the sons of Mer@@ ari , according to all their service , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the pri@@ est .
these were they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , which Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
even those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fa@@ thers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of all that might do service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , whom Mos@@ es and Aaron did number according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .

and a man lie with her car@@ n@@ ally , and it be hi@@ d from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be def@@ iled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;

and he shall consec@@ rate un@@ to the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lam@@ b of the first year for a t@@ res@@ pass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was def@@ iled .
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , with the bas@@ ket of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : the pri@@ est shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the N@@ azar@@ ite shall s@@ have the head of his separation at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and shall take the ha@@ ir of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings .
and it came to pass on the day that Mos@@ es had fully set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and had ano@@ in@@ ted it , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and all the instruments there@@ of , both the alt@@ ar and all the vessels there@@ of , and had ano@@ in@@ ted them , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied them ;
and the pr@@ inces offered for dedic@@ ating of the alt@@ ar in the day that it was ano@@ in@@ ted , even the pr@@ inces offered their offering before the alt@@ ar .
and his offering was one silver char@@ ger , the weight there@@ of was an hundred and thirty sh@@ ek@@ els , one silver bo@@ w@@ l of sev@@ enty sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; both of them were full of fine fl@@ our min@@ g@@ led with oil for a meat offering :

and all the ox@@ en for the sacrifice of the peace offer@@ ings were twenty and four bul@@ loc@@ ks , the r@@ ams six@@ ty , the he go@@ ats six@@ ty , the lam@@ bs of the first year six@@ ty . this was the dedic@@ ation of the alt@@ ar , after that it was ano@@ in@@ ted .
and this work of the cand@@ le@@ stick was of beaten gold , un@@ to the S@@ haf@@ t there@@ of , un@@ to the flowers there@@ of , was beaten work : according un@@ to the pat@@ tern which the Lord had she@@ wed Mos@@ es , so he made the cand@@ le@@ stick .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bul@@ loc@@ ks : and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , un@@ to the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for the L@@ evi@@ tes .
for they are wh@@ ol@@ ly given un@@ to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every w@@ om@@ b , even instead of the fir@@ st@@ born of all the children of Israel , have I taken them un@@ to me .
and Mos@@ es , and Aaron , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , did to the L@@ evi@@ tes according un@@ to all that the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so did the children of Israel un@@ to them .
and after that went the L@@ evi@@ tes in to do their service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the Lord had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es concerning the L@@ evi@@ tes , so did they un@@ to them .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the ri@@ tes of it , and according to all the ceremon@@ ies there@@ of , shall ye keep it .
and there were certain men , who were def@@ iled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the pass@@ over on that day : and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said un@@ to him , We are def@@ iled by the dead body of a man : where@@ fore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and for@@ be@@ aret@@ h to keep the pass@@ over , even the same sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and on the day that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was re@@ ar@@ ed up the cl@@ oud covered the tab@@ ern@@ acle , name@@ ly , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
and when the cl@@ oud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cl@@ oud abo@@ de , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their ten@@ ts .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they pit@@ ched : as long as the cl@@ oud abo@@ de upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle they rested in their ten@@ ts .
and so it was , when the cl@@ oud was a few days upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they abo@@ de in their ten@@ ts , and according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cl@@ oud tar@@ ried upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle , remaining there@@ on , the children of Israel abo@@ de in their ten@@ ts , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not : but when it was taken up , they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they rested in the ten@@ ts , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord they jour@@ ne@@ yed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord by the hand of Mos@@ es .
make the@@ e two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver ; of a whole piece s@@ halt th@@ ou make them : that th@@ ou may@@ est use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and ye shall be remember@@ ed before the Lord your God , and ye shall be sav@@ ed from your enem@@ ies .
and it came to pass on the tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cl@@ oud was taken up from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their armies : and over his host was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the r@@ er@@ e@@ ward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i .
and it shall be , if th@@ ou go with us , ye@@ a , it shall be , that what Go@@ od@@ ness the Lord shall do un@@ to us , the same will we do un@@ to the@@ e .
and they depar@@ ted from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and when the people complained , it disp@@ le@@ ased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led ; and the fire of the Lord bur@@ n@@ t among them , and consu@@ med them that were in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the camp .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mil@@ ls , or beat it in a mort@@ ar , and bak@@ ed it in p@@ ans , and made cak@@ es of it : and the tas@@ te of it was as the tas@@ te of fresh oil .
and if th@@ ou deal thus with me , kill me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , out of hand , if I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight ; and let me not see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edn@@ ess .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , G@@ ather un@@ to me sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of Israel , whom th@@ ou know@@ est to be the el@@ ders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that they may stand there with the@@ e .
and I will come down and talk with the@@ e there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon the@@ e , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with the@@ e , that th@@ ou bear it not th@@ y@@ self alone .
but even a whole month , until it come out at your nos@@ tr@@ ils , and it be lo@@ ath@@ some un@@ to you : because that ye have desp@@ ised the Lord which is among you , and have we@@ pt before him , saying , Wh@@ y came we forth out of Egypt ?
and the Lord came down in a cl@@ oud , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it un@@ to the sev@@ enty el@@ ders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , and did not ce@@ ase .
and there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day 's journey on this side , and as it were a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cu@@ bi@@ ts high upon the face of the ear@@ th .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the qu@@ ails : he that gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , ER@@ E it was che@@ wed , the wr@@ ath of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and the Lord smo@@ te the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
( now the man Mos@@ es was very me@@ ek , above all the men which were upon the face of the ear@@ th . )
and the Lord came down in the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am : and they both came forth .
with him will I speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even apparently , and not in dark spe@@ eches ; and the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of the Lord shall he be@@ hold : where@@ fore then were ye not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant Mos@@ es ?
and Aaron said un@@ to Mos@@ es , A@@ las , my lor@@ d , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , lay not the sin upon us , where@@ in we have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly , and where@@ in we have sin@@ ned .
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they d@@ well in , whether in ten@@ ts , or in strong holds ;
and they as@@ cen@@ ded by the south , and came un@@ to He@@ br@@ on ; where Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
and they came un@@ to the Bro@@ ok of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from th@@ ence a branch with one cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es , and they b@@ are it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and of the fig@@ s .
and they went and came to Mos@@ es , and to Aaron , and to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , un@@ to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an , to K@@ ade@@ sh ; and brought back word un@@ to them , and un@@ to all the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and she@@ wed them the fruit of the land .
the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites d@@ well in the land of the south : and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , d@@ well in the mountains : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ well by the sea , and by the coast of Jordan .
and all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said un@@ to them , Wo@@ uld God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !
because all those men which have seen my gl@@ ory , and my mir@@ ac@@ les , which I did in Egypt and in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and have temp@@ ted me now these ten times , and have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to my voice ;
your car@@ cases shall fall in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and all that were num@@ ber@@ ed of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and up@@ ward , which have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,
doub@@ t@@ less ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sw@@ are to make you d@@ well there@@ in , save Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even for@@ ty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , even for@@ ty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
and they rose up early in the morning , and g@@ at them up into the top of the mountain , saying , L@@ o , we be here , and will go up un@@ to the place which the Lord hat@@ h promised : for we have sin@@ ned .
and will make an offering by fire un@@ to the Lord , a bur@@ n@@ t offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vo@@ w , or in a fre@@ e@@ will offering , or in your so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts , to make a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord , of the her@@ d , or of the flock :
Y@@ e shall offer up a c@@ ake of the first of your d@@ ough for an he@@ ave offering : as ye do the he@@ ave offering of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , so shall ye he@@ ave it .
then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignor@@ ance without the knowledge of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall offer one young bul@@ lock for a bur@@ n@@ t offering , for a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one k@@ id of the go@@ ats for a sin offering .
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , and it shall be for@@ given them ; for it is ignor@@ ance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire un@@ to the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignor@@ ance :
and the pri@@ est shall make an At@@ on@@ ement for the sou@@ l that sin@@ net@@ h ignor@@ antly , when he sin@@ net@@ h by ignor@@ ance before the Lord , to make an At@@ on@@ ement for him ; and it shall be for@@ given him .
Y@@ e shall have one law for him that sin@@ net@@ h through ignor@@ ance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them .
but the sou@@ l that do@@ eth ought pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a st@@ ran@@ ger , the same re@@ pro@@ ach@@ eth the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among his people .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fr@@ inges in the borders of their gar@@ ments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the f@@ rin@@ ge of the borders a ri@@ b@@ band of blue :
and it shall be un@@ to you for a f@@ rin@@ ge , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a wh@@ oring :
and put fire there@@ in , and put incen@@ se in them before the Lord to mor@@ row : and it shall be that the man whom the Lord do@@ th choose , he shall be hol@@ y : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of L@@ evi .
is it a small thing that th@@ ou h@@ ast brought us up out of a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey , to kill us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , except th@@ ou make th@@ y@@ self altogether a pr@@ ince over us ?
so they g@@ at up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram came out , and stood in the door of their ten@@ ts , and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their little children .
and the ear@@ th opened her m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained un@@ to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
and it came to pass , when the Con@@ gre@@ gation was gathered against Mos@@ es and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation : and , be@@ hold , the cl@@ oud covered it , and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared .
and Aaron took as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded , and ran into the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ; and , be@@ hold , the pla@@ gue was begun among the people : and he put on incen@@ se , and made an At@@ on@@ ement for the people .
speak un@@ to the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a ro@@ d according to the house of their fa@@ thers , of all their pr@@ inces according to the house of their fa@@ thers twelve ro@@ ds : write th@@ ou every man 's name upon his ro@@ d .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's ro@@ d , whom I shall choose , shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m : and I will make to ce@@ ase from me the mur@@ mur@@ ings of the children of Israel , where@@ by they mur@@ mur against you .
and Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , and every one of their pr@@ inces gave him a ro@@ d ap@@ i@@ ece , for each pr@@ ince one , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , even twelve ro@@ ds : and the ro@@ d of Aaron was among their ro@@ ds .
and it came to pass , that on the mor@@ row Mos@@ es went into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness ; and , be@@ hold , the ro@@ d of Aaron for the house of L@@ evi was bud@@ ded , and brought forth bu@@ ds , and blo@@ o@@ med b@@ los@@ s@@ oms , and yi@@ elded al@@ mon@@ ds .
and they shall keep TH@@ Y charge , and the charge of all the tab@@ ern@@ acle : only they shall not come n@@ igh the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the alt@@ ar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined un@@ to the@@ e , and keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , for all the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle : and a st@@ ran@@ ger shall not come n@@ igh un@@ to you .
and I , be@@ hold , I have taken your bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Aaron , be@@ hold , I also have given the@@ e the charge of mine he@@ ave offer@@ ings of all the hal@@ low@@ ed things of the children of Israel ; un@@ to the@@ e have I given them by reason of the ano@@ in@@ ting , and to TH@@ Y sons , by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
this shall be th@@ ine of the most hol@@ y things , reserved from the fire : every ob@@ lation of the@@ ir@@ s , every meat offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every sin offering of the@@ ir@@ s , and every t@@ res@@ pass offering of the@@ ir@@ s , which they shall ren@@ der un@@ to me , shall be most hol@@ y for the@@ e and for TH@@ Y sons .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of them which they shall offer un@@ to the Lord , them have I given the@@ e .
and those that are to be re@@ deemed from a month old s@@ halt th@@ ou re@@ de@@ em , according to th@@ ine esti@@ mation , for the money of five sh@@ ek@@ els , after the sh@@ ek@@ el of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which is twenty ger@@ ah@@ s .
and , be@@ hold , I have given the children of L@@ evi all the tenth in Israel for an inher@@ it@@ ance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
but the ti@@ th@@ es of the children of Israel , which they offer as an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord , I have given to the L@@ evi@@ tes to inher@@ it : therefore I have said un@@ to them , A@@ mon@@ g the children of Israel they shall have no inher@@ it@@ ance .
thus speak un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , and say un@@ to them , When ye take of the children of Israel the ti@@ th@@ es which I have given you from them for your inher@@ it@@ ance , then ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the ti@@ the .
and this your he@@ ave offering shall be rec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to you , as though it were the cor@@ n of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and as the ful@@ ness of the win@@ e@@ press .
thus ye also shall offer an he@@ ave offering un@@ to the Lord of all your ti@@ th@@ es , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give there@@ of the Lord 's he@@ ave offering to Aaron the pri@@ est .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , When ye have heav@@ ed the best there@@ of from it , then it shall be counted un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes as the increase of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and as the increase of the win@@ e@@ press .
this is the ordin@@ ance of the law which the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded , saying , Spe@@ ak un@@ to the children of Israel , that they bring the@@ e a red he@@ if@@ er without spot , where@@ in is no ble@@ mis@@ h , and upon which never came yok@@ e :
and ye shall give her un@@ to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall s@@ lay her before his face :
then the pri@@ est shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and he shall ba@@ the his f@@ les@@ h in water , and after@@ ward he shall come into the camp , and the pri@@ est shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that gather@@ eth the ashes of the he@@ if@@ er shall was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and be un@@ clean until the even : and it shall be un@@ to the children of Israel , and un@@ to the st@@ ran@@ ger that so@@ journ@@ eth among them , for a statute for ever .
he shall pur@@ ify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he pur@@ ify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever tou@@ ch@@ eth the dead body of any man that is dead , and pur@@ i@@ fi@@ eth not himself , def@@ il@@ eth the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; and that sou@@ l shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him , he shall be un@@ clean ; his un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess is yet upon him .
and the clean person shall sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le upon the un@@ clean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall pur@@ ify himself , and was@@ h his clo@@ th@@ es , and ba@@ the himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be un@@ clean , and shall not pur@@ ify himself , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , because he hat@@ h def@@ iled the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord : the water of separation hat@@ h not been sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led upon him ; he is un@@ clean .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation , into the de@@ sert of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people abo@@ de in K@@ ade@@ sh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
and where@@ fore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in un@@ to this ev@@ il place ? it is no place of se@@ ed , or of fig@@ s , or of v@@ ines , or of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates ; neither is there any water to drink .
and Mos@@ es and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly un@@ to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and they fell upon their faces : and the gl@@ ory of the Lord appeared un@@ to them .
and when we cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , he heard our voice , and sent an an@@ gel , and hat@@ h brought us forth out of Egypt : and , be@@ hold , we are in K@@ ade@@ sh , a city in the ut@@ ter@@ most of TH@@ Y border :
Aaron shall be gathered un@@ to his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given un@@ to the children of Israel , because ye rebel@@ led against my word at the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah .
and when king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the sp@@ ies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and they jour@@ ne@@ yed from mount H@@ or by the way of the Red sea , to comp@@ ass the land of E@@ dom : and the sou@@ l of the people was much dis@@ cour@@ aged because of the way .
therefore the people came to Mos@@ es , and said , We have sin@@ ned , for we have spoken against the Lord , and against the@@ e ; pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord , that he take away the Ser@@ pen@@ ts from us . and Mos@@ es pray@@ ed for the people .
and the Lord said un@@ to Mos@@ es , Mak@@ e the@@ e a fi@@ ery ser@@ p@@ ent , and set it upon a pol@@ e : and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bit@@ ten , when he lo@@ ok@@ eth upon it , shall live .
and Mos@@ es made a ser@@ p@@ ent of br@@ ass , and put it upon a pol@@ e , and it came to pass , that if a ser@@ p@@ ent had bit@@ ten any man , when he be@@ held the ser@@ p@@ ent of br@@ ass , he lived .
from th@@ ence they removed , and pit@@ ched on the other side of Ar@@ non , which is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness that co@@ me@@ th out of the co@@ asts of the Am@@ ori@@ tes : for Ar@@ non is the border of Mo@@ a@@ b , between Mo@@ a@@ b and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
let me pass through TH@@ Y land : we will not turn into the fields , or into the v@@ ine@@ yards ; we will not drink of the waters of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past TH@@ Y borders .
and Israel smo@@ te him with the edge of the s@@ word , and poss@@ essed his land from Ar@@ non un@@ to J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , even un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon : for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
for H@@ es@@ h@@ bon was the city of S@@ ih@@ on the king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and taken all his land out of his hand , even un@@ to Ar@@ non .
for there is a fire gone out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , a fla@@ me from the city of S@@ ih@@ on : it hat@@ h consu@@ med A@@ r of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the lor@@ ds of the high places of Ar@@ non .
and they turned and went up by the way of B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
and the el@@ ders of Mo@@ a@@ b and the el@@ ders of Mi@@ dian depar@@ ted with the re@@ wards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , and sp@@ ake un@@ to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
and God 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led because he went : and the an@@ gel of the Lord stood in the way for an ad@@ versary against him . now he was ri@@ ding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am smo@@ te the ass , to turn her into the way .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she th@@ rust her@@ self un@@ to the wall , and cr@@ us@@ hed Bal@@ a@@ am 's fo@@ ot against the wall : and he smo@@ te her again .
and the an@@ gel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the an@@ gel of the Lord , she fell down under Bal@@ a@@ am : and Bal@@ a@@ am 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led , and he smo@@ te the ass with a staff .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the an@@ gel of the Lord standing in the way , and his s@@ word drawn in his hand : and he bo@@ wed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am was come , he went out to meet him un@@ to a city of Mo@@ a@@ b , which is in the border of Ar@@ non , which is in the ut@@ most coast .
for from the top of the ro@@ cks I see him , and from the hil@@ ls I be@@ hold him : lo , the people shall d@@ well alone , and shall not be rec@@ kon@@ ed among the nations .
be@@ hold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the pre@@ y , and drink the blood of the sla@@ in .
he shall p@@ our the water out of his bu@@ c@@ kets , and his se@@ ed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than A@@ ga@@ g , and his k@@ ing@@ dom shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hat@@ h as it were the strength of an un@@ ic@@ or@@ n : he shall eat up the nations his enem@@ ies , and shall break their b@@ ones , and Pi@@ erce them through with his ar@@ ro@@ ws .
and Bal@@ ak 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he smo@@ te his hands together : and Bal@@ ak said un@@ to Bal@@ a@@ am , I called the@@ e to cur@@ se mine enem@@ ies , and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou h@@ ast altogether b@@ les@@ sed them these three times .
and , be@@ hold , one of the children of Israel came and brought un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren a Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman in the sight of Mos@@ es , and in the sight of all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , who were we@@ eping before the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ azar , the son of Aaron the pri@@ est , saw it , he rose up from among the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and took a j@@ av@@ elin in his hand ;
now the name of the Isra@@ elite that was sla@@ in , even that was sla@@ in with the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman , was Z@@ im@@ ri , the son of Sal@@ u , a pr@@ ince of a chief house among the Sime@@ on@@ ites .
and the name of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman that was sla@@ in was Co@@ z@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Mi@@ dian .
these are the families of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites : and they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were for@@ ty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty .
and the sons of Eli@@ a@@ b ; Nem@@ uel , and Da@@ than , and A@@ bi@@ ram . this is that Da@@ than and A@@ bi@@ ram , which were famous in the Con@@ gre@@ gation , who stro@@ ve against Mos@@ es and against Aaron in the company of Kor@@ ah , when they stro@@ ve against the Lord :
and the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h after their families were ; of She@@ lah , the family of the S@@ hel@@ an@@ ites : of P@@ har@@ ez , the family of the P@@ har@@ zi@@ tes : of Zer@@ ah , the family of the Zar@@ hi@@ tes .
of the sons of Ze@@ bul@@ un after their families : of Ser@@ ed , the family of the Sar@@ di@@ tes : of El@@ on , the family of the E@@ lon@@ ites : of Jah@@ le@@ el , the family of the Jah@@ le@@ eli@@ tes .
these are the families of the sons of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them , thirty and two thousand and five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
these are the families of the sons of As@@ her according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them ; who were fif@@ ty and three thousand and four hundred .
to many th@@ ou s@@ halt give the more inher@@ it@@ ance , and to few th@@ ou s@@ halt give the less inher@@ it@@ ance : to every one shall his inher@@ it@@ ance be given according to those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of him .
and these are they that were num@@ ber@@ ed of the L@@ evi@@ tes after their families : of Ger@@ sh@@ on , the family of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites : of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the family of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : of Mer@@ ari , the family of the Mer@@ ar@@ ites .
these are the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes : the family of the Lib@@ ni@@ tes , the family of the He@@ bron@@ ites , the family of the Mah@@ li@@ tes , the family of the Mus@@ hi@@ tes , the family of the Kor@@ ath@@ ites . and Ko@@ hat@@ h beg@@ at Am@@ ram .
and the name of Am@@ ram 's wife was Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed , the daughter of L@@ evi , whom her mother b@@ are to L@@ evi in Egypt : and she b@@ are un@@ to Am@@ ram Aaron and Mos@@ es , and Mi@@ ri@@ am their sister .
and those that were num@@ ber@@ ed of them were twenty and three thousand , all mal@@ es from a month old and up@@ ward : for they were not num@@ ber@@ ed among the children of Israel , because there was no inher@@ it@@ ance given them among the children of Israel .
our father died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kor@@ ah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had speak right : th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely give them a possession of an inher@@ it@@ ance among their father 's bre@@ th@@ ren ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause the inher@@ it@@ ance of their father to pass un@@ to them .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt speak un@@ to the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inher@@ it@@ ance to pass un@@ to his daughter .
for ye rebel@@ led against my comman@@ d@@ ment in the de@@ sert of Z@@ in , in the stri@@ fe of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Mer@@ i@@ bah in K@@ ade@@ sh in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in .
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord be not as she@@ ep which have no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and he shall stand before Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , who shall ask coun@@ sel for him after the judgment of U@@ rim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
and the drink offering there@@ of shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lam@@ b : in the hol@@ y place s@@ halt th@@ ou cause the strong wine to be p@@ oured un@@ to the Lord for a drink offering .
and their drink offer@@ ings shall be half an hin of wine un@@ to a bul@@ lock , and the third part of an hin un@@ to a ram , and a fourth part of an hin un@@ to a lam@@ b : this is the bur@@ n@@ t offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
after this manner ye shall offer daily , throughout the seven days , the meat of the sacrifice made by fire , of a swe@@ et sav@@ our un@@ to the Lord : it shall be offered bes@@ ide the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , and his drink offering .
also in the day of the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its , when ye bring a new meat offering un@@ to the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an hol@@ y con@@ voc@@ ation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offer@@ ings for the bul@@ loc@@ ks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
these things ye shall do un@@ to the Lord in your set fe@@ asts , bes@@ ide your vows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , for your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and for your meat offer@@ ings , and for your drink offer@@ ings , and for your peace offer@@ ings .
if a man vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , or swe@@ ar an oath to bin@@ d his sou@@ l with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proce@@ ede@@ th out of his m@@ outh .
and her father hear her vo@@ w , and her bond where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her father dis@@ allow her in the day that he he@@ aret@@ h ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds where@@ with she hat@@ h bound her sou@@ l , shall stand : and the Lord shall for@@ give her , because her father dis@@ allowed her .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
but if her husband dis@@ allowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vo@@ w which she vowed , and that which she ut@@ tered with her li@@ ps , where@@ with she bound her sou@@ l , of none effect : and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but if her husband hat@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ly made them vo@@ id on the day he heard them ; then wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever proce@@ eded out of her li@@ ps concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her sou@@ l , shall not stand : her husband hat@@ h made them vo@@ id ; and the Lord shall for@@ give her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establis@@ het@@ h all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confir@@ me@@ th them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
and Mos@@ es sent them to the war , a thousand of every tri@@ be , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the hol@@ y instruments , and the tr@@ ump@@ ets to blow in his hand .
and they sle@@ w the kings of Mi@@ dian , bes@@ ide the rest of them that were sla@@ in ; name@@ ly , Evi , and Rek@@ em , and Z@@ ur , and H@@ ur , and Re@@ ba , five kings of Mi@@ dian : Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or they sle@@ w with the s@@ word .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Mi@@ dian cap@@ tives , and their little ones , and took the sp@@ oil of all their c@@ attle , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks , and all their goods .
and they brought the cap@@ tives , and the pre@@ y , and the sp@@ oil , un@@ to Mos@@ es , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , un@@ to the camp at the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b , which are by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and Mos@@ es was wro@@ th with the officers of the host , with the cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
and divide the pre@@ y into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Con@@ gre@@ gation :
and lev@@ y a tri@@ bute un@@ to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one sou@@ l of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the be@@ ev@@ es , and of the ass@@ es , and of the she@@ ep :
and the bo@@ o@@ ty , being the rest of the pre@@ y which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and sev@@ enty thousand and five thousand she@@ ep ,
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred she@@ ep :
( now the half that per@@ tained un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred she@@ ep ,
even of the children of Israel 's half , Mos@@ es took one portion of fif@@ ty , both of man and of be@@ ast , and gave them un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , which kept the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord ; as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near un@@ to Mos@@ es :
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred and fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
now the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad had a very great multi@@ tude of c@@ attle : and when they saw the land of Jaz@@ er , and the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that , be@@ hold , the place was a place for c@@ attle ;
for when they went up un@@ to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they dis@@ cour@@ aged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
and the Lord 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , that had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , was consu@@ med .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them un@@ to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the f@@ enced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and the land be sub@@ du@@ ed before the Lord : then after@@ ward ye shall return , and be guil@@ t@@ less before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
and Mos@@ es gave un@@ to them , even to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and un@@ to half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , the k@@ ing@@ dom of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the land , with the cities there@@ of in the co@@ asts , even the cities of the country round about .
these are the jour@@ neys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Mos@@ es and Aaron .
and they depar@@ ted from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the mor@@ row after the pass@@ over the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
and they depar@@ ted from before P@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , and passed through the mid@@ st of the sea into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and went three days ' journey in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Eth@@ am , and pit@@ ched in Mar@@ ah .
and Aaron the pri@@ est went up into mount H@@ or at the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , and died there , in the for@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their m@@ ol@@ ten images , and quite p@@ lu@@ ck down all their high places :
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pri@@ cks in your eyes , and thor@@ ns in your sides , and shall ve@@ x you in the land where@@ in ye d@@ well .
command the children of Israel , and say un@@ to them , When ye come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; ( this is the land that shall fall un@@ to you for an inher@@ it@@ ance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an with the co@@ asts there@@ of : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass on to Z@@ in : and the going forth there@@ of shall be from the south to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea , and shall go on to Hazar @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , and pass on to Az@@ mon :
and the border shall f@@ et@@ ch a comp@@ ass from Az@@ mon un@@ to the river of Egypt , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the sea .
from mount H@@ or ye shall point out your border un@@ to the entrance of Ham@@ ath ; and the go@@ ings forth of the border shall be to Z@@ ed@@ ad :
and the coast shall go down from S@@ hep@@ ham to R@@ ib@@ lah , on the east side of A@@ in ; and the border shall des@@ cen@@ d , and shall reach un@@ to the side of the sea of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard :
for the tri@@ be of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en according to the house of their fa@@ thers , and the tri@@ be of the children of G@@ ad according to the house of their fa@@ thers , have received their inher@@ it@@ ance ; and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have received their inher@@ it@@ ance :
command the children of Israel , that they give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes of the inher@@ it@@ ance of their possession cities to d@@ well in ; and ye shall give also un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes subur@@ bs for the cities round about them .
and the subur@@ bs of the cities , which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall reach from the wall of the city and ou@@ tw@@ ard a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give un@@ to the L@@ evi@@ tes there shall be six cities for ref@@ uge , which ye shall appoint for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er , that he may flee th@@ ither : and to them ye shall add for@@ ty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be for@@ ty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their subur@@ bs .
Y@@ e shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which shall be cities of ref@@ uge .
and the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall deliver the S@@ lay@@ er out of the hand of the reven@@ ger of blood , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation shall restore him to the city of his ref@@ uge , w@@ hi@@ ther he was fled : and he shall abide in it un@@ to the death of the high pri@@ est , which was ano@@ in@@ ted with the hol@@ y oil .
because he should have remained in the city of his ref@@ uge until the death of the high pri@@ est : but after the death of the high pri@@ est the S@@ lay@@ er shall return into the land of his possession .
W@@ hos@@ o kil@@ le@@ th any person , the mur@@ der@@ er shall be put to death by the m@@ outh of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his ref@@ uge , that he should come again to d@@ well in the land , until the death of the pri@@ est .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it def@@ il@@ eth the land : and the land can@@ not be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed there@@ in , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and the chief fa@@ thers of the families of the children of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and sp@@ ake before Mos@@ es , and before the pr@@ inces , the chief fa@@ thers of the children of Israel :
and they said , The Lord comman@@ ded my lor@@ d to give the land for an inher@@ it@@ ance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lor@@ d was comman@@ ded by the Lord to give the inher@@ it@@ ance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother un@@ to his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
and when the j@@ ub@@ ile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inher@@ it@@ ance be put un@@ to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be where@@ un@@ to they are received : so shall their inher@@ it@@ ance be taken away from the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of our fa@@ thers .
this is the thing which the Lord do@@ th command concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them mar@@ ry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tri@@ be of their father shall they mar@@ ry .
so shall not the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Israel remove from tri@@ be to tri@@ be : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of his fa@@ thers .
and every daughter , that poss@@ ess@@ eth an inher@@ it@@ ance in any tri@@ be of the children of Israel , shall be wife un@@ to one of the family of the tri@@ be of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inher@@ it@@ ance of his fa@@ thers .
and it came to pass in the for@@ ti@@ eth year , in the ele@@ venth month , on the first day of the month , that Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , according un@@ to all that the Lord had given him in comman@@ d@@ ment un@@ to them ;
( the Lord God of your fa@@ thers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and b@@ less you , as he hat@@ h promised you ! )
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down un@@ to us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God do@@ th give us .
and ye mur@@ mu@@ red in your ten@@ ts , and said , Bec@@ ause the Lord ha@@ ted us , he hat@@ h brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to destroy us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to she@@ w you by what way ye should go , and in a cl@@ oud by day .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a pre@@ y , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and ev@@ il , they shall go in th@@ ither , and un@@ to them will I give it , and they shall poss@@ ess it .
and command th@@ ou the people , saying , Y@@ e are to pass through the coast of your bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore :
Y@@ e shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
and when we passed by from our bre@@ th@@ ren the children of E@@ sa@@ u , which d@@ wel@@ t in Se@@ ir , through the way of the pla@@ in from E@@ la@@ th , and from E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ g@@ ab@@ er , we turned and passed by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and the Av@@ ims which d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ er@@ im , even un@@ to Az@@ z@@ ah , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ ims , which came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead . )
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Ar@@ non : be@@ hold , I have given into th@@ ine hand S@@ ih@@ on the Am@@ or@@ ite , king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and his land : begin to poss@@ ess it , and conten@@ d with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dre@@ ad of the@@ e and the fear of the@@ e upon the nations that are under the whole heav@@ en , who shall hear report of the@@ e , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and be in an@@ gu@@ ish because of the@@ e .
and we took all his cities at that time , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the br@@ ink of the river of Ar@@ non , and from the city that is by the river , even un@@ to G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , there was not one city too strong for us : the Lord our God delivered all un@@ to us :
only un@@ to the land of the children of Am@@ mon th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st not , nor un@@ to any place of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , nor un@@ to the cities in the mountains , nor un@@ to wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever the Lord our God for@@ bad us .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , Fe@@ ar him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into TH@@ Y hand ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt do un@@ to him as th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st un@@ to S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t at H@@ es@@ h@@ bon .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon ;
and the rest of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and all B@@ ash@@ an , being the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g , gave I un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , with all B@@ ash@@ an , which was called the land of gi@@ ants .
and un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and un@@ to the G@@ adi@@ tes I gave from G@@ il@@ e@@ ad even un@@ to the river Ar@@ non half the val@@ ley , and the border even un@@ to the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , which is the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
O Lord God , th@@ ou h@@ ast begun to she@@ w TH@@ Y ser@@ vant TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand : for what God is there in heav@@ en or in ear@@ th , that can do according to TH@@ Y works , and according to TH@@ Y might ?
get the@@ e up into the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and lift up th@@ ine eyes w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and be@@ hold it with th@@ ine eyes : for th@@ ou s@@ halt not go over this Jordan .
Y@@ e shall not add un@@ to the word which I command you , neither shall ye dimin@@ ish ought from it , that ye may keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God which I command you .
only take heed to th@@ y@@ self , and keep TH@@ Y sou@@ l dil@@ ig@@ ently , lest th@@ ou forget the things which th@@ ine eyes have seen , and lest they de@@ part from TH@@ Y heart all the days of TH@@ Y life : but te@@ ach them TH@@ Y sons , and TH@@ Y sons ' sons ;
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sak@@ es , and sw@@ are that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in un@@ to that good land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance :
take heed un@@ to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest ye forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a Gra@@ ven image , or the lik@@ eness of any thing , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h for@@ bid@@ den the@@ e .
when th@@ ou art in tri@@ bu@@ lation , and all these things are come upon the@@ e , even in the latter days , if th@@ ou turn to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and s@@ halt be obe@@ di@@ ent un@@ to his voice ;
out of heav@@ en he made the@@ e to hear his voice , that he might instruc@@ t the@@ e : and upon ear@@ th he she@@ wed the@@ e his great fire ; and th@@ ou hear@@ dest his words out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
and because he lov@@ ed TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , therefore he chose their se@@ ed after them , and brought the@@ e out in his sight with his m@@ igh@@ ty power out of Egypt ;
that the S@@ lay@@ er might flee th@@ ither , which should kill his neighbour un@@ awar@@ es , and ha@@ ted him not in times past ; and that fle@@ eing un@@ to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the judg@@ ments , which Mos@@ es sp@@ ake un@@ to the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to she@@ w you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not make the@@ e any Gra@@ ven image , or any lik@@ eness of any thing that is in heav@@ en above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the waters ben@@ e@@ ath the ear@@ th :
and remember that th@@ ou w@@ ast a ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord TH@@ Y God brought the@@ e out th@@ ence through a m@@ igh@@ ty hand and by a stret@@ ched out arm : therefore the Lord TH@@ Y God comman@@ ded the@@ e to keep the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the mid@@ st of the d@@ ark@@ ness , ( for the mountain did bur@@ n with fire , ) that ye came near un@@ to me , even all the heads of your tri@@ bes , and your el@@ ders ;
and ye said , be@@ hold , the Lord our God hat@@ h she@@ wed us his gl@@ ory and his gre@@ at@@ ness , and we have heard his voice out of the mid@@ st of the fire : we have seen this day that God do@@ th talk with man , and he li@@ vet@@ h .
go th@@ ou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak th@@ ou un@@ to us all that the Lord our God shall speak un@@ to the@@ e ; and we will hear it , and do it .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye sp@@ ake un@@ to me ; and the Lord said un@@ to me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken un@@ to the@@ e : they have well said all that they have spoken .
Y@@ e shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hat@@ h comman@@ ded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prol@@ ong your days in the land which ye shall poss@@ ess .
that th@@ ou m@@ igh@@ test fear the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep all his stat@@ utes and his comman@@ d@@ ments , which I command the@@ e , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y son , and TH@@ Y son 's son , all the days of TH@@ Y life ; and that TH@@ Y days may be prol@@ on@@ ged .
hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with the@@ e , and that ye may increase m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly , as the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers hat@@ h promised the@@ e , in the land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to TH@@ Y children , and s@@ halt talk of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , and when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
( for the Lord TH@@ Y God is a Je@@ al@@ ous God among you ) lest the an@@ ger of the Lord TH@@ Y God be kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and destroy the@@ e from off the face of the ear@@ th .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with the@@ e , and that th@@ ou may@@ est go in and poss@@ ess the good land which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers ,
but because the Lord lov@@ ed you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn un@@ to your fa@@ thers , hat@@ h the Lord brought you out with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bon@@ d@@ men , from the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it shall come to pass , if ye he@@ arken to these judg@@ ments , and keep , and do them , that the Lord TH@@ Y God shall keep un@@ to the@@ e the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and the mer@@ cy which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers :
and the Lord will take away from the@@ e all si@@ ck@@ ness , and will put none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which th@@ ou know@@ est , upon the@@ e ; but will lay them upon all them that h@@ ate the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt consum@@ e all the people which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall deliver the@@ e ; th@@ ine eye shall have no p@@ ity upon them : neither s@@ halt th@@ ou serve their go@@ ds ; for that will be a sn@@ are un@@ to the@@ e .
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will put out those nations before the@@ e by little and little : th@@ ou may@@ est not consum@@ e them at once , lest the be@@ asts of the field increase upon the@@ e .
and he shall deliver their kings into th@@ ine hand , and th@@ ou s@@ halt destroy their name from under heav@@ en : there shall no man be able to stand before the@@ e , until th@@ ou have destroyed them .
then th@@ ine heart be lifted up , and th@@ ou forget the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
but th@@ ou s@@ halt remember the Lord TH@@ Y God : for it is he that gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e power to get wealth , that he may establish his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he sw@@ are un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , as it is this day .
remember , and forget not , how th@@ ou provok@@ ed@@ st the Lord TH@@ Y God to wr@@ ath in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : from the day that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st de@@ part out of the land of Egypt , until ye came un@@ to this place , ye have been rebel@@ li@@ ous against the Lord .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which the Lord made with you , then I abo@@ de in the mount for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the Lord delivered un@@ to me two tables of stone written with the fin@@ ger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the Lord sp@@ ake with you in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , arise , get the@@ e down quickly from hence ; for TH@@ Y people which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of Egypt have cor@@ rupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I comman@@ ded them ; they have made them a m@@ ol@@ ten image .
and I looked , and , be@@ hold , ye had sin@@ ned against the Lord your God , and had made you a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had comman@@ ded you .
I pray@@ ed therefore un@@ to the Lord , and said , O Lord God , destroy not TH@@ Y people and th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou h@@ ast re@@ deemed through TH@@ Y gre@@ at@@ ness , which th@@ ou h@@ ast brought forth out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand .
L@@ est the land wh@@ ence th@@ ou b@@ rough@@ test us out say , Bec@@ ause the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he ha@@ ted them , he hat@@ h brought them out to s@@ lay them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten comman@@ d@@ ments , which the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to you in the mount out of the mid@@ st of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gave them un@@ to me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his stead .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of the Lord your God , his gre@@ at@@ ness , his m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and his stret@@ ched out arm ,
and his mir@@ ac@@ les , and his acts , which he did in the mid@@ st of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h the king of Egypt , and un@@ to all his land ;
and what he did un@@ to the army of Egypt , un@@ to their hor@@ ses , and to their char@@ i@@ ots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to over@@ flow them as they pursu@@ ed after you , and how the Lord hat@@ h destroyed them un@@ to this day ;
and that ye may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers to give un@@ to them and to their se@@ ed , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey .
for the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est in to poss@@ ess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from wh@@ ence ye came out , where th@@ ou so@@ w@@ ed@@ st TH@@ Y se@@ ed , and water@@ ed@@ st it with TH@@ Y fo@@ ot , as a gar@@ den of her@@ bs :
a land which the Lord TH@@ Y God c@@ aret@@ h for : the eyes of the Lord TH@@ Y God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even un@@ to the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that th@@ ou may@@ est gather in TH@@ Y cor@@ n , and TH@@ Y wine , and th@@ ine oil .
and then the Lord 's wr@@ ath be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he shut up the heav@@ en , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye per@@ ish quickly from off the good land which the Lord gi@@ vet@@ h you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l , and bin@@ d them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as fron@@ t@@ lets between your eyes .
and ye shall te@@ ach them your children , speaking of them when th@@ ou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when th@@ ou walk@@ est by the way , when th@@ ou li@@ est down , and when th@@ ou ris@@ est up .
every place where@@ on the so@@ les of your feet shall tre@@ ad shall be yo@@ urs : from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , even un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall tre@@ ad upon , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to you .
and a cur@@ se , if ye will not obe@@ y the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other go@@ ds , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h brought the@@ e in un@@ to the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it , that th@@ ou s@@ halt put the b@@ les@@ sing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se upon mount E@@ bal .
are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun go@@ eth down , in the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , which d@@ well in the champ@@ a@@ ign over against G@@ ilg@@ al , bes@@ ide the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ re@@ h ?
these are the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it , all the days that ye live upon the ear@@ th .
Y@@ e shall ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all the places , where@@ in the nations which ye shall poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , upon the high mountains , and upon the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow their al@@ tar@@ s , and break their pil@@ lars , and bur@@ n their gro@@ ves with fire ; and ye shall he@@ w down the Gra@@ ven images of their go@@ ds , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
but un@@ to the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tri@@ bes to put his name there , even un@@ to his habi@@ tation shall ye seek , and th@@ ither th@@ ou s@@ halt come :
and th@@ ither ye shall bring your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and your ti@@ th@@ es , and he@@ ave offer@@ ings of your hand , and your vows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ lings of your her@@ ds and of your f@@ loc@@ ks :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that ye put your hand un@@ to , ye and your households , where@@ in the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e .
but when ye go over Jordan , and d@@ well in the land which the Lord your God gi@@ vet@@ h you to inher@@ it , and when he gi@@ vet@@ h you rest from all your enem@@ ies round about , so that ye d@@ well in safety ;
then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to d@@ well there ; th@@ ither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , your ti@@ th@@ es , and the he@@ ave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord :
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of TH@@ Y tri@@ bes , there th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there th@@ ou s@@ halt do all that I command the@@ e .
T@@ ho@@ u may@@ est not eat within TH@@ Y gates the ti@@ the of TH@@ Y cor@@ n , or of TH@@ Y wine , or of TH@@ Y oil , or the fir@@ st@@ lings of TH@@ Y her@@ ds or of TH@@ Y flock , nor any of TH@@ Y vows which th@@ ou vo@@ west , nor TH@@ Y fre@@ e@@ will offer@@ ings , or he@@ ave offering of th@@ ine hand :
when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall en@@ large TH@@ Y border , as he hat@@ h promised the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt say , I will eat f@@ les@@ h , because TH@@ Y sou@@ l lon@@ get@@ h to eat f@@ les@@ h ; th@@ ou may@@ est eat f@@ les@@ h , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y sou@@ l lus@@ te@@ th after .
if the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen to put his name there be too far from the@@ e , then th@@ ou s@@ halt kill of TH@@ Y her@@ d and of TH@@ Y flock , which the Lord hat@@ h given the@@ e , as I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat in TH@@ Y gates wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever TH@@ Y sou@@ l lus@@ te@@ th after .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , the f@@ les@@ h and the blood , upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God : and the blood of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be p@@ oured out upon the alt@@ ar of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the f@@ les@@ h .
when the Lord TH@@ Y God shall cut off the nations from before the@@ e , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess them , and th@@ ou succe@@ ede@@ st them , and d@@ wel@@ lest in their land ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not do so un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Lord , which he ha@@ te@@ th , have they done un@@ to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters they have bur@@ n@@ t in the fire to their go@@ ds .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , where@@ of he sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Let us go after other go@@ ds , which th@@ ou h@@ ast not known , and let us serve them ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not he@@ arken un@@ to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for the Lord your God pro@@ vet@@ h you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hat@@ h sought to th@@ rust the@@ e away from the Lord TH@@ Y God , which brought the@@ e out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought among you ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely sm@@ ite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in , and the c@@ attle there@@ of , with the edge of the s@@ word .
for th@@ ou art an hol@@ y people un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and the Lord hat@@ h chosen the@@ e to be a pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar people un@@ to himself , above all the nations that are upon the ear@@ th .
and every be@@ ast that par@@ te@@ th the ho@@ of , and cle@@ av@@ eth the cle@@ ft into two cla@@ ws , and che@@ w@@ eth the cu@@ d among the be@@ asts , that ye shall eat .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in th@@ ine hand , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose :
if there be among you a poor man of one of TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren within any of TH@@ Y gates in TH@@ Y land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt not har@@ den th@@ ine heart , nor shut th@@ ine hand from TH@@ Y poor brother :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely give him , and th@@ ine heart shall not be gri@@ ev@@ ed when th@@ ou gi@@ v@@ est un@@ to him : because that for this thing the Lord TH@@ Y God shall b@@ less the@@ e in all TH@@ Y works , and in all that th@@ ou p@@ ut@@ test th@@ ine hand un@@ to .
for the poor shall never ce@@ ase out of the land : therefore I command the@@ e , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt open th@@ ine hand wide un@@ to TH@@ Y brother , to TH@@ Y poor , and to TH@@ Y ne@@ edy , in TH@@ Y land .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of TH@@ Y flock , and out of TH@@ Y floor , and out of TH@@ Y win@@ e@@ press : of that where@@ with the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to him .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt therefore sacrifice the pass@@ over un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and there shall be no le@@ av@@ ened bread seen with the@@ e in all TH@@ Y coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the f@@ les@@ h , which th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed@@ st the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
but at the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose to place his name in , there th@@ ou s@@ halt sacrifice the pass@@ over at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st forth out of Egypt .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : and th@@ ou s@@ halt turn in the morning , and go un@@ to TH@@ Y ten@@ ts .
seven weeks s@@ halt th@@ ou number un@@ to the@@ e : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as th@@ ou begin@@ n@@ est to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the cor@@ n .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt keep the feast of weeks un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God with a tri@@ bute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of th@@ ine hand , which th@@ ou s@@ halt give un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , according as the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h b@@ les@@ sed the@@ e :

seven days s@@ halt th@@ ou keep a so@@ lem@@ n feast un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which the Lord shall choose : because the Lord TH@@ Y God shall b@@ less the@@ e in all th@@ ine increase , and in all the works of th@@ ine hands , therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely re@@ jo@@ ice .
if there be found among you , within any of TH@@ Y gates which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , man or woman , that hat@@ h w@@ rought w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord TH@@ Y God , in trans@@ g@@ ressing his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ,
and it be told the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast heard of it , and inqu@@ ired dil@@ ig@@ ently , and , be@@ hold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is w@@ rought in Israel :
then s@@ halt th@@ ou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that w@@ ic@@ ked thing , un@@ to TH@@ Y gates , even that man or that woman , and s@@ halt stone them with stones , ti@@ ll they die .
at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is wor@@ thy of death be put to death ; but at the m@@ outh of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and after@@ ward the hands of all the people . so th@@ ou s@@ halt put the ev@@ il away from among you .
if there arise a matter too hard for the@@ e in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stro@@ ke and stro@@ ke , being matters of controversy within TH@@ Y gates : then s@@ halt th@@ ou arise , and get the@@ e up into the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose ;

and the man that will do pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , and will not he@@ arken un@@ to the pri@@ est that stan@@ de@@ th to minister there before the Lord TH@@ Y God , or un@@ to the judge , even that man shall die : and th@@ ou s@@ halt put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
when th@@ ou art come un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and s@@ halt poss@@ ess it , and s@@ halt d@@ well there@@ in , and s@@ halt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ;
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt in any wise set him king over the@@ e , whom the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose : one from among TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren s@@ halt th@@ ou set king over the@@ e : th@@ ou may@@ est not set a st@@ ran@@ ger over the@@ e , which is not TH@@ Y brother .
but he shall not multi@@ ply hor@@ ses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multi@@ ply hor@@ ses : for@@ as@@ much as the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall hen@@ ce@@ forth return no more that way .
and it shall be , when he sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , that he shall write him a cop@@ y of this law in a book out of that which is before the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read there@@ in all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this law and these stat@@ utes , to do them :
that his heart be not lifted up above his bre@@ th@@ ren , and that he turn not aside from the comman@@ d@@ ment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prol@@ ong his days in his k@@ ing@@ dom , he , and his children , in the mid@@ st of Israel .
and this shall be the pri@@ est 's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep ; and they shall give un@@ to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
and if a Lev@@ ite come from any of TH@@ Y gates out of all Israel , where he so@@ jour@@ ned , and come with all the desire of his mind un@@ to the place which the Lord shall choose ;
for these nations , which th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess , hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to observers of times , and un@@ to di@@ vin@@ ers : but as for the@@ e , the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h not suffered the@@ e so to do .
according to all that th@@ ou desi@@ red@@ st of the Lord TH@@ Y God in Ho@@ re@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
I will raise them up a Pro@@ phe@@ t from among their bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to the@@ e , and will put my words in his m@@ outh ; and he shall speak un@@ to them all that I shall command him .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not he@@ arken un@@ to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the pro@@ phe@@ t , which shall pres@@ ume to speak a word in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other go@@ ds , even that pro@@ phe@@ t shall die .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not remove TH@@ Y neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in th@@ ine inher@@ it@@ ance , which th@@ ou s@@ halt inher@@ it in the land that the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e to poss@@ ess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sin@@ net@@ h : at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or at the m@@ outh of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
then shall ye do un@@ to him , as he had thought to have done un@@ to his brother : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put the ev@@ il away from among you .
when th@@ ou go@@ est out to battle against th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and se@@ est hor@@ ses , and char@@ i@@ ots , and a people more than th@@ ou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord TH@@ Y God is with the@@ e , which brought the@@ e up out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall be , when ye are come n@@ igh un@@ to the battle , that the pri@@ est shall approach and speak un@@ to the people ,
and the officers shall speak un@@ to the people , saying , What man is there that hat@@ h built a new house , and hat@@ h not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedic@@ ate it .
and what man is he that hat@@ h plan@@ ted a v@@ ine@@ yard , and hat@@ h not yet e@@ aten of it ? let him also go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hat@@ h bet@@ ro@@ th@@ ed a wife , and hat@@ h not taken her ? let him go and return un@@ to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further un@@ to the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fear@@ ful and fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return un@@ to his house , lest his bre@@ th@@ ren 's heart fa@@ int as well as his heart .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking un@@ to the people , that they shall make cap@@ tains of the armies to lead the people .
and it shall be , if it make the@@ e answer of peace , and open un@@ to the@@ e , then it shall be , that all the people that is found there@@ in shall be tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to the@@ e , and they shall serve the@@ e .
but the women , and the little ones , and the c@@ attle , and all that is in the city , even all the sp@@ oil there@@ of , s@@ halt th@@ ou take un@@ to th@@ y@@ self ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the sp@@ oil of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e .
and it shall be , that the city which is next un@@ to the sla@@ in man , even the el@@ ders of that city shall take an he@@ if@@ er , which hat@@ h not been w@@ rought with , and which hat@@ h not drawn in the yok@@ e ;
and the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi shall come near ; for them the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h chosen to minister un@@ to him , and to b@@ less in the name of the Lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stro@@ ke be tried :
and it shall be , if th@@ ou have no de@@ light in her , then th@@ ou s@@ halt let her go w@@ hi@@ ther she will ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not sell her at all for money , th@@ ou s@@ halt not make mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of her , because th@@ ou h@@ ast hum@@ b@@ led her .
then it shall be , when he mak@@ eth his sons to inher@@ it that which he hat@@ h , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , which is indeed the fir@@ st@@ born :
if a man have a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous son , which will not obe@@ y the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have ch@@ as@@ tened him , will not he@@ arken un@@ to them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out un@@ to the el@@ ders of his city , and un@@ to the gate of his place ;
in like manner s@@ halt th@@ ou do with his ass ; and so s@@ halt th@@ ou do with his ra@@ im@@ ent ; and with all lost thing of TH@@ Y brother 's , which he hat@@ h lost , and th@@ ou h@@ ast found , s@@ halt th@@ ou do likewise : th@@ ou may@@ est not hide th@@ y@@ self .
the woman shall not wear that which per@@ tain@@ eth un@@ to a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's gar@@ ment : for all that do so are ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
if a bird 's n@@ est chance to be before the@@ e in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eg@@ gs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eg@@ gs , th@@ ou s@@ halt not take the dam with the young :
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an ev@@ il name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a ma@@ id :
then shall the father of the dam@@ sel , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the dam@@ sel 's vir@@ gin@@ ity un@@ to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate :
and they shall am@@ erce him in an hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and give them un@@ to the father of the dam@@ sel , because he hat@@ h brought up an ev@@ il name upon a vir@@ gin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so s@@ halt th@@ ou put away ev@@ il from Israel .
but un@@ to the dam@@ sel th@@ ou s@@ halt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
then the man that lay with her shall give un@@ to the dam@@ sel 's father fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hat@@ h hum@@ b@@ led her , he may not put her away all his days .
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against the@@ e Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or of P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se the@@ e .
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that chan@@ c@@ eth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening co@@ me@@ th on , he shall was@@ h himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt have a p@@ add@@ le upon TH@@ Y weapon ; and it shall be , when th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t ease th@@ y@@ self abroad , th@@ ou s@@ halt di@@ g there@@ with , and s@@ halt turn back and cover that which co@@ me@@ th from the@@ e :
for the Lord TH@@ Y God walk@@ eth in the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y camp , to deliver the@@ e , and to give up th@@ ine enem@@ ies before the@@ e ; therefore shall TH@@ Y camp be hol@@ y : that he see no un@@ clean thing in the@@ e , and turn away from the@@ e .
he shall d@@ well with the@@ e , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of TH@@ Y gates , where it lik@@ eth him best : th@@ ou s@@ halt not op@@ press him .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not bring the h@@ ire of a wh@@ ore , or the price of a do@@ g , into the house of the Lord TH@@ Y God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God .
un@@ to a st@@ ran@@ ger th@@ ou may@@ est lend upon us@@ ury ; but un@@ to TH@@ Y brother th@@ ou s@@ halt not lend upon us@@ ury : that the Lord TH@@ Y God may b@@ less the@@ e in all that th@@ ou set@@ test th@@ ine hand to in the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
that which is gone out of TH@@ Y li@@ ps th@@ ou s@@ halt keep and perform ; even a fre@@ e@@ will offering , according as th@@ ou h@@ ast vowed un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised with TH@@ Y m@@ outh .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into TH@@ Y neighbour 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then th@@ ou may@@ est eat grap@@ es TH@@ Y fill at th@@ ine own pleas@@ ure ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not put any in TH@@ Y ves@@ sel .
when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st into the standing cor@@ n of TH@@ Y neighbour , then th@@ ou may@@ est p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars with th@@ ine hand ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt not move a si@@ ck@@ le un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour 's standing cor@@ n .
when a man hat@@ h taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hat@@ h found some un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess in her : then let him write her a bill of div@@ or@@ cement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
and if the latter husband h@@ ate her , and write her a bill of div@@ or@@ cement , and gi@@ vet@@ h it in her hand , and sen@@ de@@ th her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is def@@ iled ; for that is ab@@ omin@@ ation before the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not cause the land to sin , which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
when a man hat@@ h taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall che@@ er up his wife which he hat@@ h taken .
if a man be found ste@@ aling any of his bre@@ th@@ ren of the children of Israel , and mak@@ eth mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise of him , or sel@@ le@@ th him ; then that th@@ i@@ ef shall die ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt put ev@@ il away from among you .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that th@@ ou observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so ye shall observe to do .
at his day th@@ ou s@@ halt give him his h@@ ire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and set@@ te@@ th his heart upon it : lest he cry against the@@ e un@@ to the Lord , and it be sin un@@ to the@@ e .
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
when th@@ ou gather@@ est the grap@@ es of TH@@ Y v@@ ine@@ yard , th@@ ou s@@ halt not g@@ le@@ an it after@@ ward : it shall be for the st@@ ran@@ ger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then TH@@ Y brother should seem v@@ ile un@@ to the@@ e .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one dra@@ w@@ eth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that sm@@ ite@@ th him , and p@@ ut@@ te@@ th forth her hand , and tak@@ eth him by the secre@@ ts :
how he met the@@ e by the way , and smo@@ te the hin@@ d@@ most of the@@ e , even all that were fe@@ e@@ ble behind the@@ e , when th@@ ou w@@ ast fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he fear@@ ed not God .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou art come in un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e for an inher@@ it@@ ance , and poss@@ ess@@ est it , and d@@ wel@@ lest there@@ in ;
that th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the first of all the fruit of the ear@@ th , which th@@ ou s@@ halt bring of TH@@ Y land that the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , and s@@ halt put it in a bas@@ ket , and s@@ halt go un@@ to the place which the Lord TH@@ Y God shall choose to place his name there .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt go un@@ to the pri@@ est that shall be in those days , and say un@@ to him , I prof@@ ess this day un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , that I am come un@@ to the country which the Lord sw@@ are un@@ to our fa@@ thers for to give us .
and now , be@@ hold , I have brought the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of the land , which th@@ ou , O Lord , h@@ ast given me . and th@@ ou s@@ halt set it before the Lord TH@@ Y God , and worship before the Lord TH@@ Y God :
and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in every good thing which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given un@@ to the@@ e , and un@@ to th@@ ine house , th@@ ou , and the Lev@@ ite , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that is among you .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast av@@ ou@@ ched the Lord this day to be TH@@ Y God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his judg@@ ments , and to he@@ arken un@@ to his voice :
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan un@@ to the land which the Lord TH@@ Y God gi@@ vet@@ h the@@ e , that th@@ ou s@@ halt set the@@ e up great stones , and pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount E@@ bal , and th@@ ou s@@ halt pla@@ ister them with pla@@ ister .
and it shall come to pass , if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to observe and to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments which I command the@@ e this day , that the Lord TH@@ Y God will set the@@ e on high above all nations of the ear@@ th :
b@@ les@@ sed shall be the fruit of TH@@ Y body , and the fruit of TH@@ Y ground , and the fruit of TH@@ Y c@@ attle , the increase of TH@@ Y k@@ ine , and the f@@ loc@@ ks of TH@@ Y she@@ ep .
and all people of the ear@@ th shall see that th@@ ou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go aside from any of the words which I command the@@ e this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other go@@ ds to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to observe to do all his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which I command the@@ e this day ; that all these cur@@ ses shall come upon the@@ e , and over@@ take the@@ e :
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e with a consumption , and with a f@@ ever , and with an inf@@ lam@@ mation , and with an extreme burning , and with the s@@ word , and with b@@ lasting , and with mil@@ dew ; and they shall pursue the@@ e until th@@ ou per@@ ish .
the Lord will sm@@ ite the@@ e with the bot@@ ch of Egypt , and with the emer@@ ods , and with the sc@@ a@@ b , and with the it@@ ch , where@@ of th@@ ou can@@ st not be he@@ aled .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : th@@ ou s@@ halt build an house , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not d@@ well there@@ in : th@@ ou s@@ halt plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and s@@ halt not gather the grap@@ es there@@ of .
Th@@ ine o@@ x shall be sla@@ in before th@@ ine eyes , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not eat there@@ of : th@@ ine ass shall be viol@@ ently taken away from before TH@@ Y face , and shall not be restored to the@@ e : TH@@ Y she@@ ep shall be given un@@ to th@@ ine enem@@ ies , and th@@ ou s@@ halt have none to rescue them .
TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given un@@ to another people , and th@@ ine eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in th@@ ine hand .
the fruit of TH@@ Y land , and all TH@@ Y la@@ bour@@ s , shall a nation which th@@ ou know@@ est not eat up ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt be only op@@ pressed and cr@@ us@@ hed al@@ way :
the Lord shall sm@@ ite the@@ e in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bot@@ ch that can@@ not be he@@ aled , from the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot un@@ to the top of TH@@ Y head .
and he shall bes@@ i@@ ege the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates , until TH@@ Y high and f@@ enced walls come down , where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ ted@@ st , throughout all TH@@ Y land : and he shall bes@@ i@@ ege the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates throughout all TH@@ Y land , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt eat the fruit of th@@ ine own body , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sons and of TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , which the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h given the@@ e , in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress the@@ e :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the f@@ les@@ h of his children whom he shall eat : because he hat@@ h nothing left him in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enem@@ ies shall dist@@ ress the@@ e in all TH@@ Y gates .
if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that th@@ ou may@@ est fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , the Lord TH@@ Y God ;
then the Lord will make TH@@ Y plagu@@ es won@@ der@@ ful , and the plagu@@ es of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , even great plagu@@ es , and of long continu@@ ance , and sor@@ e si@@ ck@@ nesses , and of long continu@@ ance .
and it shall come to pass , that as the Lord re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over you to do you good , and to multi@@ ply you ; so the Lord will re@@ jo@@ ice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to n@@ ought ; and ye shall be p@@ lu@@ cked from off the land w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est to poss@@ ess it .
and among these nations s@@ halt th@@ ou find no ease , neither shall the sole of TH@@ Y fo@@ ot have rest : but the Lord shall give the@@ e there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and sor@@ row of mind :
in the morning th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Wo@@ uld God it were even ! and at even th@@ ou s@@ halt say , Wo@@ uld God it were morning ! for the fear of th@@ ine heart where@@ with th@@ ou s@@ halt fear , and for the sight of th@@ ine eyes which th@@ ou s@@ halt see .
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , bes@@ ide the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
and Mos@@ es called un@@ to all Israel , and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and un@@ to all his servants , and un@@ to all his land ;
that he may establish the@@ e to day for a people un@@ to himself , and that he may be un@@ to the@@ e a God , as he hat@@ h said un@@ to the@@ e , and as he hat@@ h sworn un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , to I@@ sa@@ ac , and to Jac@@ o@@ b .
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the st@@ ran@@ ger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagu@@ es of that land , and the si@@ ck@@ nesses which the Lord hat@@ h laid upon it ;
then men shall say , Bec@@ ause they have for@@ sak@@ en the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon the@@ e , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , which I have set before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt call them to mind among all the nations , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h driven the@@ e ,
and s@@ halt return un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God , and s@@ halt obe@@ y his voice according to all that I command the@@ e this day , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y children , with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l ;
that then the Lord TH@@ Y God will turn TH@@ Y cap@@ tivity , and have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e , and will return and gather the@@ e from all the nations , w@@ hi@@ ther the Lord TH@@ Y God hat@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered the@@ e .
if any of th@@ ine be driven out un@@ to the out@@ most parts of heav@@ en , from th@@ ence will the Lord TH@@ Y God gather the@@ e , and from th@@ ence will he f@@ et@@ ch the@@ e :
and the Lord TH@@ Y God will circum@@ c@@ ise th@@ ine heart , and the heart of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , to love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , that th@@ ou may@@ est live .
if th@@ ou s@@ halt he@@ arken un@@ to the voice of the Lord TH@@ Y God , to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes which are written in this book of the law , and if th@@ ou turn un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
I den@@ oun@@ ce un@@ to you this day , that ye shall su@@ rely per@@ ish , and that ye shall not prol@@ ong your days upon the land , w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou pass@@ est over Jordan to go to poss@@ ess it .
and he said un@@ to them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hat@@ h said un@@ to me , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord TH@@ Y God , he will go over before the@@ e , and he will destroy these nations from before the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt poss@@ ess them : and Jos@@ hua , he shall go over before the@@ e , as the Lord hat@@ h said .
and the Lord shall do un@@ to them as he did to S@@ ih@@ on and to O@@ g , kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and un@@ to the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it un@@ to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , which b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and un@@ to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord TH@@ Y God in the place which he shall choose , th@@ ou s@@ halt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ ger that is within TH@@ Y gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and that their children , which have not known any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the Lord your God , as long as ye live in the land w@@ hi@@ ther ye go over Jordan to poss@@ ess it .
and I will su@@ rely hide my face in that day for all the ev@@ ils which they shall have w@@ rought , in that they are turned un@@ to other go@@ ds .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers , that flow@@ eth with milk and hon@@ ey ; and they shall have e@@ aten and filled themselves , and wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at ; then will they turn un@@ to other go@@ ds , and serve them , and prov@@ oke me , and break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and it came to pass , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
when the most High divided to the nations their inher@@ it@@ ance , when he separated the sons of A@@ dam , he set the bo@@ unds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , and oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
they have moved me to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities : and I will move them to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with those which are not a people ; I will prov@@ oke them to an@@ ger with a fo@@ ol@@ ish nation .
I will make mine ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood , and my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h ; and that with the blood of the sla@@ in and of the cap@@ tives , from the beginning of reven@@ ges upon the enemy .
get the@@ e up into this mountain A@@ bar@@ im , un@@ to mount N@@ eb@@ o , which is in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and be@@ hold the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give un@@ to the children of Israel for a possession :
and die in the mount w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou go@@ est up , and be gathered un@@ to TH@@ Y people ; as Aaron TH@@ Y brother died in mount H@@ or , and was gathered un@@ to his people :
because ye t@@ res@@ passed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah @@@ -@@ @ K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because ye sanc@@ ti@@ fied me not in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
and for the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of the ear@@ th and ful@@ ness there@@ of , and for the good will of him that d@@ wel@@ t in the b@@ ush : let the b@@ les@@ sing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his bre@@ th@@ ren .
they shall call the people un@@ to the mountain ; there they shall offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : for they shall su@@ ck of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , and of treasures hi@@ d in the s@@ and .
and Mos@@ es went up from the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b un@@ to the mountain of N@@ eb@@ o , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . and the Lord she@@ wed him all the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to Dan ,
and the Lord said un@@ to him , This is the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , un@@ to I@@ sa@@ ac , and un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b , saying , I will give it un@@ to TH@@ Y se@@ ed : I have caused the@@ e to see it with th@@ ine eyes , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not go over th@@ ither .
and Jos@@ hua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wis@@ dom ; for Mos@@ es had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to him , and did as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
now after the death of Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord sp@@ ake un@@ to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , Mos@@ es ' minister , saying ,
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and this Lebanon even un@@ to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and un@@ to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
this book of the law shall not de@@ part out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh ; but th@@ ou s@@ halt medi@@ t@@ ate there@@ in day and night , that th@@ ou may@@ est observe to do according to all that is written there@@ in : for then th@@ ou s@@ halt make TH@@ Y way prosperous , and then th@@ ou s@@ halt have good success .
W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever he be that do@@ th rebel against TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ment , and will not he@@ arken un@@ to TH@@ Y words in all that th@@ ou comman@@ dest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and it came to pass about the time of sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : w@@ hi@@ ther the men went I wo@@ t not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall over@@ take them .
but she had brought them up to the ro@@ of of the house , and hi@@ d them with the st@@ alk@@ s of fla@@ x , which she had laid in order upon the ro@@ of .
be@@ hold , when we come into the land , th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d this line of scar@@ let thre@@ ad in the window which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st let us down by : and th@@ ou s@@ halt bring TH@@ Y father , and TH@@ Y mother , and TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and all TH@@ Y father 's household , home un@@ to the@@ e .
and they comman@@ ded the people , saying , When ye see the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord your God , and the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Jos@@ hua sp@@ ake un@@ to the pri@@ ests , saying , T@@ ake up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and went before the people .
and Jos@@ hua said , Her@@ e@@ by ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Gir@@ gas@@ hi@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites .
and as they that b@@ are the Ar@@ k were come un@@ to Jordan , and the feet of the pri@@ ests that b@@ are the Ar@@ k were di@@ pped in the bri@@ m of the water , ( for Jordan over@@ flow@@ eth all his banks all the time of har@@ v@@ est , )
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the Ar@@ k of the Lord passed over , and the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests that b@@ are the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord were come up out of the mid@@ st of Jordan , and the so@@ les of the pri@@ ests ' feet were lifted up un@@ to the d@@ ry land , that the waters of Jordan returned un@@ to their place , and flow@@ ed over all his banks , as they did before .
for the Lord your God dri@@ ed up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dri@@ ed up from before us , until we were gone over :
and this is the cause why Jos@@ hua did circum@@ c@@ ise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
now all the people that came out were circum@@ c@@ ised : but all the people that were born in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circum@@ c@@ ised .
and it came to pass , when they had done circum@@ c@@ ising all the people , that they abo@@ de in their places in the camp , ti@@ ll they were whole .
and the man@@ na ce@@ ased on the mor@@ row after they had e@@ aten of the old cor@@ n of the land ; neither had the children of Israel man@@ na any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua had spoken un@@ to the people , that the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns passed on before the Lord , and ble@@ w with the tr@@ ump@@ ets : and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord followed them .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they comp@@ ass@@ ed the city seven times .
and the city shall be accur@@ sed , even it , and all that are there@@ in , to the Lord : only Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers that we sent .
and ye , in any wise keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the accur@@ sed thing , lest ye make yo@@ ur@@ selves accur@@ sed , when ye take of the accur@@ sed thing , and make the camp of Israel a cur@@ se , and trouble it .
and the young men that were sp@@ ies went in , and brought Ra@@ ha@@ b , and her father , and her mother , and her bre@@ th@@ ren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kin@@ d@@ red , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was there@@ in : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron , they put into the treas@@ ury of the house of the Lord .
and Jos@@ hua sav@@ ed Ra@@ ha@@ b the har@@ lot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in Israel even un@@ to this day ; because she hi@@ d the mes@@ sen@@ gers , which Jos@@ hua sent to sp@@ y out Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ res@@ pass in the accur@@ sed thing : for A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , took of the accur@@ sed thing : and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against the children of Israel .
and Jos@@ hua sent men from Jer@@ ich@@ o to A@@ I , which is bes@@ ide Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en , on the east side of Be@@ the@@ l , and sp@@ ake un@@ to them , saying , G@@ o up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed A@@ I .
and Jos@@ hua said , A@@ las , O Lord God , where@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou at all brought this people over Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , to destroy us ? would to God we had been content , and d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan !
and it shall be , that he that is taken with the accur@@ sed thing shall be bur@@ n@@ t with fire , he and all that he hat@@ h : because he hat@@ h trans@@ g@@ ressed the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and because he hat@@ h w@@ rought Fol@@ ly in Israel .
and he brought his household man by man ; and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was taken .
and they took them out of the mid@@ st of the tent , and brought them un@@ to Jos@@ hua , and un@@ to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up against A@@ I : and Jos@@ hua chose out thirty thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , and sent them away by night .
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach un@@ to the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) ti@@ ll we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have comman@@ ded you .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew n@@ igh , and came before the city , and pit@@ ched on the north side of A@@ I : now there was a val@@ ley between them and A@@ I .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
and all the people that were in A@@ I were called together to pursue after them : and they pursu@@ ed after Jos@@ hua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the Lord said un@@ to Jos@@ hua , St@@ ret@@ ch out the spe@@ ar that is in TH@@ Y hand toward A@@ I ; for I will give it into th@@ ine hand . and Jos@@ hua stret@@ ched out the spe@@ ar that he had in his hand toward the city .
and the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and has@@ ted and set the city on fire .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the mid@@ st of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smo@@ te them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing all the inhabitants of A@@ I in the field , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where@@ in they ch@@ ased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the s@@ word , until they were consu@@ med , that all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes returned un@@ to A@@ I , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word .
they did work w@@ il@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their ass@@ es , and wine bott@@ les , old , and rent , and bound up ;
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go un@@ to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and it is mo@@ ul@@ dy :
and these bott@@ les of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , be@@ hold , they be rent : and these our gar@@ ments and our sho@@ es are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they d@@ wel@@ t among them .
therefore the five kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , the king of Eg@@ lon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and en@@ camp@@ ed before Gi@@ be@@ on , and made war against it .
and it came to pass , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had made an end of s@@ lay@@ ing them with a very great sla@@ ughter , ti@@ ll they were consu@@ med , that the rest which remained of them entered into f@@ enced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings un@@ to him out of the cave , the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
and that day Jos@@ hua took Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and the king there@@ of he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , them , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah as he did un@@ to the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and the Lord delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and they took it on that day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
and they took it , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the s@@ word , and the king there@@ of , and all the cities there@@ of , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eg@@ lon ; but destroyed it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all the so@@ ul@@ s that were there@@ in .
and it came to pass , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or had heard those things , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , and to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , and to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the pla@@ ins south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , and in the val@@ ley , and in the borders of D@@ or on the west ,
and to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and to the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite in the mountains , and to the H@@ iv@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the s@@ and that is upon the sea shore in multi@@ tude , with hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots very many .
and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , who smo@@ te them , and ch@@ ased them un@@ to great Z@@ id@@ on , and un@@ to Mis@@ rep@@ ho@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ im , and un@@ to the val@@ ley of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and they smo@@ te them , until they left them none remaining .
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Jos@@ hua take , and smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , and he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them , as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord comman@@ ded .
and all the sp@@ oil of these cities , and the c@@ attle , the children of Israel took for a pre@@ y un@@ to themselves ; but every man they smo@@ te with the edge of the s@@ word , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to bre@@ a@@ the .
for it was of the Lord to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them ut@@ ter@@ ly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the Lord comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smo@@ te , and poss@@ essed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Ar@@ non un@@ to mount Her@@ mon , and all the pla@@ in on the east :
them did Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord gave it for a possession un@@ to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is upon the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba un@@ to Di@@ bon ;
and their coast was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the mid@@ st of the river , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
and the border of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en was Jordan , and the border there@@ of . this was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Re@@ ub@@ en after their families , the cities and the villages there@@ of .
and Mos@@ es gave inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : and this was the possession of the half tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families .
and half G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and E@@ dre@@ i , cities of the k@@ ing@@ dom of O@@ g in B@@ ash@@ an , were per@@ taining un@@ to the children of Mac@@ hir the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even to the one half of the children of Mac@@ hir by their families .
and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and the heads of the fa@@ thers of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , distributed for inher@@ it@@ ance to them .
for@@ ty years old was I when Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord sent me from K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea to es@@ p@@ y out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
and now , be@@ hold , the Lord hat@@ h kept me alive , as he said , these for@@ ty and five years , even since the Lord sp@@ ake this word un@@ to Mos@@ es , while the children of Israel w@@ and@@ ered in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and now , lo , I am this day fo@@ ur@@ score and five years old .
as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Mos@@ es sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
this then was the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south coast .
and it went out to the south side to Ma@@ al@@ e@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ac@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and as@@ cen@@ ded up on the south side un@@ to K@@ ade@@ sh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ nea , and passed along to H@@ ez@@ ron , and went up to Ad@@ ar , and f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass to Kar@@ ka@@ a :
from th@@ ence it passed toward Az@@ mon , and went out un@@ to the river of Egypt ; and the go@@ ings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
and the border went up to Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ la , and passed along by the north of Beth @@@ -@@ @ arab@@ ah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en :
and the border went up toward De@@ bir from the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or , and so nor@@ th@@ ward , looking toward G@@ ilg@@ al , that is before the going up to Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at En @@@ -@@ @ ro@@ gel :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill un@@ to the fo@@ un@@ tain of the water of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border was drawn to Ba@@ al@@ ah , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im :
and the border comp@@ ass@@ ed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to mount Se@@ ir , and passed along un@@ to the side of mount J@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the border went out un@@ to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward : and the border was drawn to Sh@@ ic@@ ron , and passed along to mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out un@@ to J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast there@@ of . this is the coast of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h round about according to their families .
and go@@ eth down w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the coast of Jap@@ h@@ le@@ ti , un@@ to the coast of Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , and to Ge@@ zer : and the go@@ ings out there@@ of are at the sea .
and the border of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families was thus : even the border of their inher@@ it@@ ance on the east side was A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , un@@ to Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the up@@ per ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eas@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and passed by it on the east to Jan@@ o@@ ha@@ h ;
the border went out from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im by their families .
there was also a lot for the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph ; to w@@ it , for Mac@@ hir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad : because he was a man of war , therefore he had G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and B@@ ash@@ an .
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h by their families ; for the children of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er , and for the children of H@@ ele@@ k , and for the children of As@@ ri@@ el , and for the children of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and for the children of Hep@@ her , and for the children of Sh@@ em@@ ida : these were the male children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph by their families .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of Hep@@ her , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : and these are the names of his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , Mah@@ lah , and No@@ ah , Ho@@ g@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and the coast des@@ cen@@ ded un@@ to the river Kan@@ ah , sou@@ th@@ ward of the river : these cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im are among the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h also was on the north side of the river , and the out@@ go@@ ings of it were at the sea :
sou@@ th@@ ward it was E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's , and nor@@ th@@ ward it was Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in As@@ her on the north , and in Is@@ sac@@ har on the east .
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had in Is@@ sac@@ har and in As@@ her Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , and I@@ ble@@ am and her towns , and the inhabitants of D@@ or and her towns , and the inhabitants of En@@ dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , even three countries .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were wa@@ x@@ en strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tri@@ bute ; but did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel assemb@@ led together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation there . and the land was sub@@ du@@ ed before them .
give out from among you three men for each tri@@ be : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inher@@ it@@ ance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Ju@@ da@@ h shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their co@@ asts on the north .
and the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
and their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north side , and went up through the mountains w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en .
and the border went over from th@@ ence toward L@@ uz , to the side of L@@ uz , which is Be@@ the@@ l , sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the border des@@ cen@@ ded to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ ar , near the hill that li@@ eth on the south side of the ne@@ ther Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on .
and the border was drawn th@@ ence , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the cor@@ ner of the sea sou@@ th@@ ward , from the hill that li@@ eth before Beth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the go@@ ings out there@@ of were at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ al , which is Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , a city of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h : this was the west quarter .
and the south quarter was from the end of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , and the border went out on the west , and went out to the well of waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah :
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im , and des@@ cen@@ ded to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah nor@@ th@@ ward : and the out@@ go@@ ings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
out of the portion of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inher@@ it@@ ance within the inher@@ it@@ ance of them .
and tur@@ net@@ h toward the sun@@ rising to Beth @@@ -@@ @ da@@ g@@ on , and reac@@ het@@ h to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to the val@@ ley of J@@ ip@@ h@@ th@@ ah @@@ -@@ @ el toward the north side of Beth @@@ -@@ @ E@@ mek , and Ne@@ i@@ el , and go@@ eth out to Cab@@ ul on the left hand ,
and then the coast tur@@ net@@ h to Ram@@ ah , and to the strong city T@@ y@@ re ; and the coast tur@@ net@@ h to Hos@@ ah ; and the out@@ go@@ ings there@@ of are at the sea from the coast to A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b :
and the lot came out for the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : and the children of Aaron the pri@@ est , which were of the L@@ evi@@ tes , had by lot out of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of Benjamin , thir@@ teen cities .
and the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and out of the tri@@ be of Dan , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , ten cities .
and the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had by lot out of the families of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
the children of Mer@@ ari by their families had out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi , had : for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the pri@@ est He@@ br@@ on with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Lib@@ n@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ,
and the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes which remained of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and un@@ to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the other half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h they gave G@@ olan in B@@ ash@@ an with her subur@@ bs , to be a city of ref@@ uge for the S@@ lay@@ er ; and Be@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ter@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ; two cities .
and un@@ to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Jok@@ ne@@ am with her subur@@ bs , and Kar@@ ta@@ h with her subur@@ bs ,
and the Lord gave them rest round about , according to all that he sw@@ are un@@ to their fa@@ thers : and there stood not a man of all their enem@@ ies before them ; the Lord delivered all their enem@@ ies into their hand .
now to the one half of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Mos@@ es had given possession in B@@ ash@@ an : but un@@ to the other half there@@ of gave Jos@@ hua among their bre@@ th@@ ren on this side Jordan w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard . and when Jos@@ hua sent them away also un@@ to their ten@@ ts , then he b@@ les@@ sed them ,
and when they came un@@ to the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h built there an alt@@ ar by Jordan , a great alt@@ ar to see to .
and the children of Israel heard say , be@@ hold , the chi@@ d@@ ren of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have built an alt@@ ar over against the land of Can@@ a@@ an , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up to war against them .
and the children of Israel sent un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and they came un@@ to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , un@@ to the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and they sp@@ ake with them , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the Lord , What t@@ res@@ pass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have buil@@ ded you an alt@@ ar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord ? and it will be , seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord , that to mor@@ row he will be wro@@ th with the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
that we have built us an alt@@ ar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer there@@ on bur@@ n@@ t offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offer@@ ings there@@ on , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak un@@ to our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sp@@ ake , it pleased them .
and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the pr@@ inces , returned from the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and from the children of G@@ ad , out of the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , un@@ to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
and the Lord your God , he shall exp@@ el them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall poss@@ ess their land , as the Lord your God hat@@ h promised un@@ to you .
be ye therefore very cour@@ age@@ ous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Mos@@ es , that ye turn not aside there@@ from to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to them :
for the Lord hat@@ h driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hat@@ h been able to stand before you un@@ to this day .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cle@@ ave un@@ to the re@@ mn@@ ant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marri@@ ages with them , and go in un@@ to them , and they to you :
and when they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , he put d@@ ark@@ ness between you and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : and ye d@@ wel@@ t in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a long season .
and I brought you into the land of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might poss@@ ess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came un@@ to Jer@@ ich@@ o : and the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Gir@@ gas@@ hi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dra@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ; but not with TH@@ Y s@@ word , nor with TH@@ Y bo@@ w .
and it came to pass after these things , that Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and Israel served the Lord all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders that over@@ lived Jos@@ hua , and which had known all the works of the Lord , that he had done for Israel .
now after the death of Jos@@ hua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying , Wh@@ o shall go up for us against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites first , to fight against them ?
now the children of Ju@@ da@@ h had fought against Jer@@ usalem , and had taken it , and s@@ mit@@ ten it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
and after@@ ward the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , that d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and in the south , and in the val@@ ley .
and the children of the Ken@@ ite , Mos@@ es ' father in law , went up out of the city of pal@@ m trees with the children of Ju@@ da@@ h into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ju@@ da@@ h , which li@@ eth in the south of Ara@@ d ; and they went and d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
and when he she@@ wed them the entrance into the city , they smo@@ te the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let go the man and all his family .
neither did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h drive out the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , nor Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of D@@ or and her towns , nor the inhabitants of I@@ ble@@ am and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns : but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would d@@ well in that land .
neither did Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i drive out the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , nor the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath ; but he d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h and of Beth @@@ -@@ @ an@@ ath became tri@@ but@@ aries un@@ to them .
and an an@@ gel of the Lord came up from G@@ ilg@@ al to Bo@@ c@@ him , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you un@@ to the land which I sw@@ are un@@ to your fa@@ thers ; and I said , I will never break my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you .
and it came to pass , when the an@@ gel of the Lord sp@@ ake these words un@@ to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders that out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
and they for@@ so@@ ok the Lord God of their fa@@ thers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other go@@ ds , of the go@@ ds of the people that were round about them , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them , and provoked the Lord to an@@ ger .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of sp@@ o@@ ilers that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enem@@ ies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enem@@ ies .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for ev@@ il , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn un@@ to them : and they were greatly dist@@ ressed .
and yet they would not he@@ arken un@@ to their judges , but they went a wh@@ oring after other go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed themselves un@@ to them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fa@@ thers walked in , obe@@ ying the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
and when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ e@@ b 's younger brother .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
but when the children of Israel cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliver@@ er , E@@ h@@ ud the son of Ger@@ a , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a man le@@ f@@ than@@ ded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present un@@ to Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b .
and E@@ h@@ ud came un@@ to him ; and he was sitting in a summer par@@ l@@ our , which he had for himself alone . and E@@ h@@ ud said , I have a message from God un@@ to the@@ e . and he ar@@ ose out of his seat .
and they tar@@ ried ti@@ ll they were as@@ ha@@ med : and , be@@ hold , he opened not the doors of the par@@ l@@ our ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
and it came to pass , when he was come , that he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et in the mountain of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
now He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite , which was of the children of H@@ ob@@ a@@ b the father in law of Mos@@ es , had sever@@ ed himself from the Ken@@ ites , and pit@@ ched his tent un@@ to the pla@@ in of Za@@ an@@ aim , which is by K@@ ede@@ sh .
and Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les un@@ to the river of K@@ ish@@ on .
and the Lord dis@@ com@@ fi@@ ted Sis@@ era , and all his char@@ i@@ ots , and all his host , with the edge of the s@@ word before B@@ arak ; so that Sis@@ era ligh@@ ted down off his char@@ i@@ ot , and fled away on his feet .
but B@@ arak pursu@@ ed after the char@@ i@@ ots , and after the host , un@@ to Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and all the host of Sis@@ era fell upon the edge of the s@@ word ; and there was not a man left .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it Sis@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite : for there was peace between J@@ ab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
and Ja@@ el went out to meet Sis@@ era , and said un@@ to him , Tur@@ n in , my lor@@ d , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in un@@ to her into the tent , she covered him with a man@@ tle .
again he said un@@ to her , St@@ and in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man do@@ th come and inqu@@ ire of the@@ e , and say , Is there any man here ? that th@@ ou s@@ halt say , No .
and , be@@ hold , as B@@ arak pursu@@ ed Sis@@ era , Ja@@ el came out to meet him , and said un@@ to him , C@@ ome , and I will she@@ w the@@ e the man whom th@@ ou seek@@ est . and when he came into her tent , be@@ hold , Sis@@ era lay dead , and the na@@ il was in his temp@@ les .
and the hand of the children of Israel prosp@@ ered , and prev@@ ailed against J@@ ab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
they that are delivered from the no@@ ise of ar@@ chers in the places of drawing water , there shall they re@@ hear@@ se the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the Lord , even the righ@@ te@@ ous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after the@@ e , Benjamin , among TH@@ Y people ; out of Mac@@ hir came down govern@@ ors , and out of Ze@@ bul@@ un they that handle the p@@ en of the writer .
she put her hand to the na@@ il , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer ; and with the ham@@ mer she smo@@ te Sis@@ era , she smo@@ te off his head , when she had pi@@ er@@ ced and stric@@ ken through his temp@@ les .
and the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel : and because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and c@@ aves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
for they came up with their c@@ attle and their ten@@ ts , and they came as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers for multi@@ tude ; for both they and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all that op@@ pressed you , and dra@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and there came an an@@ gel of the Lord , and sat under an o@@ ak which was in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , that per@@ tained un@@ to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ r@@ ite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on th@@ res@@ hed wheat by the win@@ e@@ press , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and G@@ ide@@ on went in , and made ready a k@@ id , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fl@@ our : the f@@ les@@ h he put in a bas@@ ket , and he put the bro@@ th in a po@@ t , and brought it out un@@ to him under the o@@ ak , and presented it .
and build an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord TH@@ Y God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bul@@ lock , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice with the wood of the gro@@ ve which th@@ ou s@@ halt cut down .
then G@@ ide@@ on took ten men of his servants , and did as the Lord had said un@@ to him : and so it was , because he fear@@ ed his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and when the men of the city ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , the alt@@ ar of Ba@@ al was cast down , and the gro@@ ve was cut down that was by it , and the second bul@@ lock was offered upon the alt@@ ar that was built .
be@@ hold , I will put a F@@ le@@ ece of wo@@ ol in the floor ; and if the dew be on the F@@ le@@ ece only , and it be d@@ ry upon all the ear@@ th bes@@ ide , then shall I know that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t save Israel by mine hand , as th@@ ou h@@ ast said .
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pit@@ ched bes@@ ide the well of Har@@ od : so that the host of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Mo@@ re@@ h , in the val@@ ley .
so he brought down the people un@@ to the water : and the Lord said un@@ to G@@ ide@@ on , Every one that lap@@ pet@@ h of the water with his ton@@ gue , as a do@@ g lap@@ pet@@ h , him s@@ halt th@@ ou set by himself ; likewise every one that bo@@ w@@ eth down upon his k@@ ne@@ es to drink .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt hear what they say ; and after@@ ward shall th@@ ine hands be strengthened to go down un@@ to the host . then went he down with P@@ hur@@ ah his ser@@ vant un@@ to the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and by the sea side for multi@@ tude .
and it was so , when G@@ ide@@ on heard the telling of the dream , and the interpre@@ tation there@@ of , that he wor@@ shi@@ pped , and returned into the host of Israel , and said , arise ; for the Lord hat@@ h delivered into your hand the host of Mi@@ dian .
and the three hundred ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and the Lord set every man 's s@@ word against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ it@@ ta@@ h in Zer@@ er@@ ath , and to the border of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , un@@ to T@@ ab@@ b@@ ath .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of As@@ her , and out of all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and pursu@@ ed after the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
now Z@@ eb@@ ah and Zal@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ kor , and their hosts with them , about fif@@ teen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew s@@ word .
thus was Mi@@ dian sub@@ du@@ ed before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness for@@ ty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and it came to pass , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a wh@@ oring after Ba@@ al@@ im , and made Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
and the children of Israel remember@@ ed not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enem@@ ies on every side :
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem un@@ to his mother 's bre@@ th@@ ren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's bre@@ th@@ ren sp@@ ake of him in the e@@ ars of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hear@@ ts inc@@ lined to follow A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch ; for they said , He is our brother .
and he went un@@ to his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and sle@@ w his bre@@ th@@ ren the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing yet Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hi@@ d himself .
and when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood in the top of mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cri@@ ed , and said un@@ to them , Hear@@ ken un@@ to me , ye men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may he@@ arken un@@ to you .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sinc@@ er@@ ely , in that ye have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , and if ye have dealt well with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and his house , and have done un@@ to him according to the de@@ serving of his hands ;
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sla@@ in his sons , thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , the son of his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ; )
and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they ro@@ bbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their v@@ ine@@ yards , and tro@@ de the grap@@ es , and made mer@@ ry , and went into the house of their go@@ d , and did eat and drink , and Cur@@ sed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , th@@ ou s@@ halt rise early , and set upon the city : and , be@@ hold , when he and the people that is with him come out against the@@ e , then may@@ est th@@ ou do to them as th@@ ou s@@ halt find occasion .
and G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , be@@ hold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smo@@ te them .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and sle@@ w them .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his b@@ ough , and followed A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the to@@ wer of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and th@@ ither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and g@@ at them up to the top of the to@@ wer .
and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch came un@@ to the to@@ wer , and fought against it , and went hard un@@ to the door of the to@@ wer to bur@@ n it with fire .
and the children of Israel did ev@@ il again in the sight of the Lord , and served Ba@@ al@@ im , and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and the go@@ ds of Syria , and the go@@ ds of Z@@ id@@ on , and the go@@ ds of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the go@@ ds of the children of Am@@ mon , and the go@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and for@@ so@@ ok the Lord , and served not him .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hands of the children of Am@@ mon .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his bre@@ th@@ ren , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain men to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and went out with him .
and it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to f@@ et@@ ch J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b :
while Israel d@@ wel@@ t in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and her towns , and in A@@ ro@@ er and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the co@@ asts of Ar@@ non , three hundred years ? why therefore did ye not rec@@ over them within that time ?
then the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came upon J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over un@@ to the children of Am@@ mon .
then it shall be , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever co@@ me@@ th forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Am@@ mon , shall su@@ rely be the Lord 's , and I will offer it up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering .
and the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im gathered themselves together , and went nor@@ th@@ ward , and said un@@ to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore pass@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou over to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and di@@ d@@ st not call us to go with the@@ e ? we will bur@@ n th@@ ine house upon the@@ e with fire .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand : where@@ fore then are ye come up un@@ to me this day , to fight against me ?
for , lo , th@@ ou s@@ halt conce@@ ive , and bear a son ; and no ras@@ or shall come on his head : for the child shall be a N@@ azar@@ ite un@@ to God from the w@@ om@@ b : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
then the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came un@@ to me , and his coun@@ tenance was like the coun@@ tenance of an an@@ gel of God , very ter@@ ri@@ ble : but I asked him not wh@@ ence he was , neither told he me his name :
and the an@@ gel of the Lord said un@@ to Man@@ o@@ ah , Th@@ ough th@@ ou de@@ tain me , I will not eat of TH@@ Y bread : and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering , th@@ ou must offer it un@@ to the Lord . for Man@@ o@@ ah knew not that he was an an@@ gel of the Lord .
for it came to pass , when the fla@@ me went up toward heav@@ en from off the alt@@ ar , that the an@@ gel of the Lord as@@ cen@@ ded in the fla@@ me of the alt@@ ar . and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a k@@ id , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing cor@@ n of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks , and also the standing cor@@ n , with the v@@ ine@@ yards and ol@@ ives .
and they said un@@ to him , We are come down to bin@@ d the@@ e , that we may deliver the@@ e into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and Sam@@ son said un@@ to them , swe@@ ar un@@ to me , that ye will not fall upon me yo@@ ur@@ selves .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand , and called that place Ram@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ le@@ hi .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his sou@@ l was v@@ ex@@ ed un@@ to death ;
and when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d : for they said , Our go@@ d hat@@ h delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destro@@ yer of our country , which sle@@ w many of us .
and it came to pass , when their hear@@ ts were mer@@ ry , that they said , C@@ all for Sam@@ son , that he may make us sport . and they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pil@@ lars .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were there ; and there were upon the ro@@ of about three thousand men and women , that be@@ held while Sam@@ son made sport .
and Sam@@ son took hold of the two middle pil@@ lars upon which the house stood , and on which it was bor@@ ne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
yet he restored the money un@@ to his mother ; and his mother took two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made there@@ of a Gra@@ ven image and a m@@ ol@@ ten image : and they were in the house of Mic@@ ah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tri@@ be of the Dani@@ tes sought them an inher@@ it@@ ance to d@@ well in ; for un@@ to that day all their inher@@ it@@ ance had not fallen un@@ to them among the tri@@ bes of Israel .
and they said , arise , that we may go up against them : for we have seen the land , and , be@@ hold , it is very good : and are ye still ? be not slo@@ th@@ ful to go , and to enter to poss@@ ess the land .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and when they were a good way from the house of Mic@@ ah , the men that were in the houses near to Mic@@ ah 's house were gathered together , and over@@ took the children of Dan .
and they took the things which Mic@@ ah had made , and the pri@@ est which he had , and came un@@ to La@@ ish , un@@ to a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , and bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born un@@ to Israel : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the Gra@@ ven image : and Jon@@ athan , the son of Ger@@ sho@@ m , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , he and his sons were pri@@ ests to the tri@@ be of Dan until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
and it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Lev@@ ite so@@ jour@@ ning on the side of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , who took to him a conc@@ ub@@ ine out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ju@@ da@@ h .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , that he rose up to de@@ part : and the dam@@ sel 's father said un@@ to his son in law , Com@@ for@@ t th@@ ine heart with a mor@@ sel of bread , and after@@ ward go your way .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the dam@@ sel 's father had said un@@ to the man , Be content , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and tar@@ ry all night , and let th@@ ine heart be mer@@ ry .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and depar@@ ted , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jer@@ usalem ; and there were with him two ass@@ es s@@ add@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said un@@ to his master , C@@ ome , I pra@@ y the@@ e , and let us turn in into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it .
and they turned aside th@@ ither , to go in and to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lo@@ d@@ ging .
and , be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he so@@ jour@@ ned in Gi@@ be@@ ah : but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
yet there is both stra@@ w and pro@@ ven@@ der for our ass@@ es ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id , and for the young man which is with TH@@ Y servants : there is no want of any thing .
and her lor@@ d rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , be@@ hold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and when he was come into his house , he took a k@@ ni@@ fe , and laid hold on his conc@@ ub@@ ine , and divided her , together with her b@@ ones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the co@@ asts of Israel .
and the men of Gi@@ be@@ ah rose against me , and bes@@ et the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have sla@@ in me : and my conc@@ ub@@ ine have they forced , that she is dead .
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Bel@@ ial , which are in Gi@@ be@@ ah , that we may put them to death , and put away ev@@ il from Israel . but the children of Benjamin would not he@@ arken to the voice of their bre@@ th@@ ren the children of Israel :
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities un@@ to Gi@@ be@@ ah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel ar@@ ose , and went up to the house of God , and asked coun@@ sel of God , and said , Wh@@ ich of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? and the Lord said , Ju@@ da@@ h shall go up first .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came un@@ to the house of God , and we@@ pt , and sat there before the Lord , and fas@@ ted that day until even , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before the Lord .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were s@@ mit@@ ten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benj@@ am@@ ites , because they tr@@ usted un@@ to the liers in wait which they had set bes@@ ide Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and the liers in wait has@@ ted , and rushed upon Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smo@@ te all the city with the edge of the s@@ word .
but when the fla@@ me began to arise up out of the city with a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them , and , be@@ hold , the fla@@ me of the city as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel un@@ to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle over@@ took them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the mid@@ st of them .
and the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smo@@ te them with the edge of the s@@ word , as well the men of every city , as the be@@ ast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
and they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them un@@ to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
then they said , be@@ hold , there is a feast of the Lord in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h ye@@ arly in a place which is on the north side of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that go@@ eth up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of L@@ eb@@ on@@ ah .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of them that dan@@ ced , whom they caught : and they went and returned un@@ to their inher@@ it@@ ance , and rep@@ aired the cities , and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and the children of Israel depar@@ ted th@@ ence at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from th@@ ence every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
then she ar@@ ose with her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law , that she might return from the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : for she had heard in the country of Mo@@ a@@ b how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return un@@ to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
turn again , my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . if I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
and she went , and came , and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and her ha@@ p was to light on a part of the field belonging un@@ to Bo@@ az , who was of the kin@@ d@@ red of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ le@@ an@@ ed : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was su@@ ffic@@ ed .
was@@ h th@@ y@@ self therefore , and ano@@ int the@@ e , and put TH@@ Y ra@@ im@@ ent upon the@@ e , and get the@@ e down to the floor : but make not th@@ y@@ self known un@@ to the man , until he shall have done e@@ ating and drinking .
and Bo@@ az said un@@ to the el@@ ders , and un@@ to all the people , Y@@ e are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's , and all that was Ch@@ il@@ ion 's and Mah@@ lon 's , of the hand of Na@@ om@@ i .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim @@@ -@@ @ z@@ op@@ him , of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of To@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite :
and they rose up in the morning early , and wor@@ shi@@ pped before the Lord , and returned , and came to their house to Ram@@ ah : and El@@ kan@@ ah knew H@@ ann@@ ah his wife ; and the Lord remember@@ ed her .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore it came to pass , when the time was come about after H@@ ann@@ ah had conce@@ ived , that she b@@ are a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Bec@@ ause I have asked him of the Lord .
but H@@ ann@@ ah went not up ; for she said un@@ to her husband , I will not go up until the child be we@@ an@@ ed , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the Lord , and there abide for ever .
and when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ loc@@ ks , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of fl@@ our , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him un@@ to the house of the Lord in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h : and the child was young .
the ad@@ vers@@ aries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heav@@ en shall he Th@@ under upon them : the Lord shall judge the ends of the ear@@ th ; and he shall give strength un@@ to his king , and ex@@ alt the Hor@@ n of his ano@@ in@@ ted .
and he struck it into the pan , or ket@@ tle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or po@@ t ; all that the fle@@ sh@@ ho@@ ok brought up the pri@@ est took for himself . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h un@@ to all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that came th@@ ither .
now E@@ li was very old , and heard all that his sons did un@@ to all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assemb@@ led at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off th@@ ine arm , and the arm of TH@@ Y father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house .
and I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine ano@@ in@@ ted for ever .
and it came to pass at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wa@@ x dim , that he could not see ;
so the people sent to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , that they might bring from th@@ ence the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord of hosts , which d@@ wel@@ le@@ th between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms : and the two sons of E@@ li , H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has , were there with the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out , they said , What mean@@ eth the no@@ ise of this great sh@@ out in the camp of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws ? and they understood that the Ar@@ k of the Lord was come into the camp .
and when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the mor@@ row , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen upon his face to the ear@@ th before the Ar@@ k of the Lord . and they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smo@@ te the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emer@@ ods in their secret parts .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore ye shall make images of your emer@@ ods , and images of your m@@ ice that mar the land ; and ye shall give gl@@ ory un@@ to the God of Israel : per@@ ad@@ venture he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your go@@ ds , and from off your land .
and the k@@ ine took the stra@@ ight way to the way of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and went along the highway , low@@ ing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went after them un@@ to the border of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h .
and they of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
and the c@@ art came into the field of Jos@@ hua , a Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ em@@ ite , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they cla@@ ve the wood of the c@@ art , and offered the k@@ ine a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes took down the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the co@@ ffer that was with it , where@@ in the je@@ wel@@ s of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the same day un@@ to the Lord .
and these are the golden emer@@ ods which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines returned for a t@@ res@@ pass offering un@@ to the Lord ; for Ash@@ do@@ d one , for Gaza one , for As@@ k@@ el@@ on one , for G@@ ath one , for E@@ kr@@ on one ;
and the men of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im came , and f@@ et@@ ched up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and brought it into the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b in the hill , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Ele@@ azar his son to keep the Ar@@ k of the Lord .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , ce@@ ase not to cry un@@ to the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the men of Israel went out of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and smo@@ te them , until they came under Beth @@@ -@@ @ car .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were sub@@ du@@ ed , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
and the Lord said un@@ to Samuel , Hear@@ ken un@@ to the voice of the people in all that they say un@@ to the@@ e : for they have not rejected the@@ e , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even un@@ to this day , where@@ with they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also un@@ to the@@ e .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his char@@ i@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ se@@ men ; and some shall run before his char@@ i@@ ots .
and he will take your fields , and your v@@ ine@@ yards , and your ol@@ i@@ ve@@ yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of B@@ ech@@ or@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Benj@@ am@@ ite , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of power .
and he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , a choice young man , and a good@@ ly : and there was not among the children of Israel a good@@ lier person than he : from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
and when they were come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant that was with him , C@@ ome , and let us return ; lest my father leave car@@ ing for the ass@@ es , and take thought for us .
( Be@@ fore@@ time in Israel , when a man went to inqu@@ ire of God , thus he sp@@ ake , C@@ ome , and let us go to the se@@ er : for he that is now called a Pro@@ phe@@ t was be@@ fore@@ time called a Se@@ er . )
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , be@@ hold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and as for th@@ ine ass@@ es that were lost three days ago , set not TH@@ Y mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on the@@ e , and on all TH@@ Y father 's house ?
and Samuel took Sa@@ ul and his ser@@ vant , and brought them into the par@@ l@@ our , and made them sit in the chi@@ ef@@ est place among them that were bid@@ den , which were about thirty persons .
and they ar@@ ose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Sa@@ ul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send the@@ e away . and Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him be@@ fore@@ time saw that , be@@ hold , he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied among the pro@@ ph@@ ets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come un@@ to the son of K@@ ish ? is Sa@@ ul also among the pro@@ ph@@ ets ?
when he had caused the tri@@ be of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Mat@@ ri was taken , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then came the mes@@ sen@@ gers to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul , and told the ti@@ dings in the e@@ ars of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and we@@ pt .
when Jac@@ o@@ b was come into Egypt , and your fa@@ thers cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , then the Lord sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , which brought forth your fa@@ thers out of Egypt , and made them d@@ well in this place .
and when they for@@ g@@ at the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sis@@ era , captain of the host of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and they fought against them .
and they cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , and said , We have sin@@ ned , because we have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , and have served Ba@@ al@@ im and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enem@@ ies , and we will serve the@@ e .
but if ye will not obe@@ y the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fa@@ thers .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and six thousand hor@@ se@@ men , and people as the s@@ and which is on the sea shore in multi@@ tude : and they came up , and pit@@ ched in Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , eas@@ tw@@ ard from Beth @@@ -@@ @ av@@ en .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it , ( for the people were dist@@ ressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in high places , and in p@@ its .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might sal@@ ute him .
but now TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom shall not continue : the Lord hat@@ h sought him a man after his own heart , and the Lord hat@@ h comman@@ ded him to be captain over his people , because th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept that which the Lord comman@@ ded the@@ e .
and the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned un@@ to the way that le@@ ade@@ th to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , un@@ to the land of Sh@@ ual :
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither s@@ word nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan : but with Sa@@ ul and with Jon@@ athan his son was there found .
now it came to pass upon a day , that Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul said un@@ to the young man that b@@ are his arm@@ our , C@@ ome , and let us go over to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
and A@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , I @@@ -@@ @ cha@@ bo@@ d 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of E@@ li , the Lord 's pri@@ est in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . and the people knew not that Jon@@ athan was gone .
and between the passa@@ ges , by which Jon@@ athan sought to go over un@@ to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ' gar@@ ris@@ on , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Boz@@ ez , and the name of the other Sen@@ e@@ h .
and that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his ar@@ mour@@ be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half ac@@ re of land , which a yok@@ e of ox@@ en might plo@@ w .
and it came to pass , while Sa@@ ul talked un@@ to the pri@@ est , that the no@@ ise that was in the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to the pri@@ est , With@@ draw th@@ ine hand .
and Sa@@ ul and all the people that were with him assemb@@ led themselves , and they came to the battle : and , be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow , and there was a very great dis@@ com@@ f@@ it@@ ure .
moreover the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes that were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hi@@ d themselves in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jon@@ athan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : where@@ fore he put forth the end of the ro@@ d that was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in an hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b , and put his hand to his m@@ outh ; and his eyes were en@@ ligh@@ tened .
and the people fle@@ w upon the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
so Sa@@ ul took the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel , and fought against all his enem@@ ies on every side , against Mo@@ a@@ b , and against the children of Am@@ mon , and against E@@ dom , and against the kings of Z@@ ob@@ ah , and against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever he turned himself , he v@@ ex@@ ed them .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ u@@ i , and Mel@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a : and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these ; the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am , the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az : and the name of the captain of his host was Ab@@ ner , the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
it re@@ pen@@ te@@ th me that I have set up Sa@@ ul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hat@@ h not performed my comman@@ d@@ ments . and it gri@@ ev@@ ed Samuel ; and he cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord all night .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Sa@@ ul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Sa@@ ul came to Car@@ mel , and , be@@ hold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to G@@ ilg@@ al .
and he had an hel@@ met of br@@ ass upon his head , and he was armed with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
and the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se went and followed Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next un@@ to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
and as he talked with them , be@@ hold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , Gol@@ i@@ ath by name , out of the armies of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sp@@ ake according to the same words : and David heard them .
David said moreover , The Lord that delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . and Sa@@ ul said un@@ to David , G@@ o , and the Lord be with the@@ e .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the Bro@@ ok , and put them in a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's bag which he had , even in a s@@ cri@@ p ; and his s@@ ling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
and it came to pass , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine ar@@ ose , and came and drew n@@ igh to meet David , that David has@@ ted , and ran toward the army to meet the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took th@@ ence a stone , and s@@ lan@@ g it , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head , that the stone sun@@ k into his fore@@ head ; and he fell upon his face to the ear@@ th .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his s@@ word , and drew it out of the she@@ ath there@@ of , and sle@@ w him , and cut off his head there@@ with . and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking un@@ to Sa@@ ul , that the sou@@ l of Jon@@ athan was k@@ n@@ it with the sou@@ l of David , and Jon@@ athan lov@@ ed him as his own sou@@ l .
and Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his gar@@ ments , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his gir@@ dle .
then the pr@@ inces of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David beha@@ ved himself more wis@@ ely than all the servants of Sa@@ ul ; so that his name was much set by .
and Sa@@ ul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the j@@ av@@ elin ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the j@@ av@@ elin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
and when the mes@@ sen@@ gers were come in , be@@ hold , there was an image in the bed , with a pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir for his bolster .
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt deal kin@@ dly with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast brought TH@@ Y ser@@ vant into a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord with the@@ e : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , if there be in me in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , s@@ lay me th@@ y@@ self ; for why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou bring me to TH@@ Y father ?
but also th@@ ou s@@ halt not cut off TH@@ Y kin@@ d@@ ness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hat@@ h cut off the enem@@ ies of David every one from the face of the ear@@ th .
and when th@@ ou h@@ ast stayed three days , then th@@ ou s@@ halt go down quickly , and come to the place where th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st hide th@@ y@@ self when the business was in hand , and s@@ halt remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jon@@ athan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little la@@ d with him .
and as soon as the la@@ d was gone , David ar@@ ose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bo@@ wed himself three times : and they k@@ is@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , until David exceeded .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g , an E@@ dom@@ ite , the chi@@ ef@@ est of the her@@ d@@ men that belonged to Sa@@ ul .
and every one that was in dist@@ ress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was dis@@ conten@@ ted , gathered themselves un@@ to him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
when Sa@@ ul heard that David was discovered , and the men that were with him , ( now Sa@@ ul abo@@ de in Gi@@ be@@ ah under a tree in Ram@@ ah , having his spe@@ ar in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ; )
and No@@ b , the city of the pri@@ ests , smo@@ te he with the edge of the s@@ word , both men and women , children and su@@ ck@@ lings , and ox@@ en , and ass@@ es , and she@@ ep , with the edge of the s@@ word .
then David and his men , which were about six hundred , ar@@ ose and depar@@ ted out of Ke@@ il@@ ah , and went w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever they could go . and it was told Sa@@ ul that David was escaped from Ke@@ il@@ ah ; and he for@@ b@@ are to go forth .
then came up the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , Do@@ th not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of J@@ es@@ him@@ on ?
Sa@@ ul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : where@@ fore he came down into a rock , and abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . and when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed after David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
and Sa@@ ul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made has@@ te to get away for fear of Sa@@ ul ; for Sa@@ ul and his men comp@@ ass@@ ed David and his men round about to take them .
and it came to pass , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Sa@@ ul . but Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
and it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words un@@ to Sa@@ ul , that Sa@@ ul said , Is this TH@@ Y voice , my son David ? and Sa@@ ul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast she@@ wed this day how that th@@ ou h@@ ast dealt well with me : for@@ as@@ much as when the Lord had delivered me into th@@ ine hand , th@@ ou kil@@ led@@ st me not .
swe@@ ar now therefore un@@ to me by the Lord , that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful coun@@ tenance : but the man was chur@@ lish and ev@@ il in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ e@@ b .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said un@@ to the young men , G@@ et you up to Car@@ mel , and go to Nab@@ al , and gre@@ et him in my name :
and now I have heard that th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ hear@@ ers : now TH@@ Y she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing un@@ to them , all the while they were in Car@@ mel .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my f@@ les@@ h that I have killed for my s@@ hear@@ ers , and give it un@@ to men , whom I know not wh@@ ence they be ?
but the men were very good un@@ to us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conver@@ san@@ t with them , when we were in the fields :
and it was so , as she ro@@ de on the ass , that she came down by the cover@@ t of the hill , and , be@@ hold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
I pra@@ y the@@ e , for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id : for the Lord will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house ; because my lor@@ d figh@@ te@@ th the batt@@ les of the Lord , and ev@@ il hat@@ h not been found in the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
yet a man is risen to pursue the@@ e , and to seek TH@@ Y sou@@ l : but the sou@@ l of my lor@@ d shall be bound in the bun@@ dle of life with the Lord TH@@ Y God ; and the so@@ ul@@ s of th@@ ine enem@@ ies , them shall he s@@ ling out , as out of the middle of a s@@ ling .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he hat@@ h spoken concerning the@@ e , and shall have appointed the@@ e ru@@ ler over Israel ;
that this shall be no gri@@ ef un@@ to the@@ e , nor off@@ ence of heart un@@ to my lor@@ d , either that th@@ ou h@@ ast shed blood ca@@ us@@ ele@@ ss , or that my lor@@ d hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged himself : but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lor@@ d , then remember th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said un@@ to her , G@@ o up in peace to th@@ ine house ; see , I have hear@@ ken@@ ed to TH@@ Y voice , and have accepted TH@@ Y person .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il came to Nab@@ al ; and , be@@ hold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nab@@ al 's heart was mer@@ ry within him , for he was very dr@@ un@@ ken : where@@ fore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il has@@ ted , and ar@@ ose , and ro@@ de upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the mes@@ sen@@ gers of David , and became his wife .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
and Sa@@ ul pit@@ ched in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before J@@ es@@ him@@ on , by the way . but David abo@@ de in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and David ar@@ ose , and came to the place where Sa@@ ul had pit@@ ched : and David be@@ held the place where Sa@@ ul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his host : and Sa@@ ul lay in the tren@@ ch , and the people pit@@ ched round about him .
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul lay sle@@ eping within the tren@@ ch , and his spe@@ ar st@@ uck in the ground at his bolster : but Ab@@ ner and the people lay round about him .
the Lord for@@ bid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's ano@@ in@@ ted : but , I pra@@ y the@@ e , take th@@ ou now the spe@@ ar that is at his bolster , and the cr@@ use of water , and let us go .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the ear@@ th before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one do@@ th hunt a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains .
and , be@@ hold , as TH@@ Y life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tri@@ bu@@ lation .
and David d@@ wel@@ t with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
and David smo@@ te the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en , and the ass@@ es , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , and the appar@@ el , and returned , and came to A@@ ch@@ ish .
and it came to pass in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for war@@ fare , to fight with Israel . and A@@ ch@@ ish said un@@ to David , K@@ now th@@ ou assu@@ red@@ ly , that th@@ ou s@@ halt go out with me to battle , th@@ ou and TH@@ Y men .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . and Sa@@ ul had put away those that had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
and the woman said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ou know@@ est what Sa@@ ul hat@@ h done , how he hat@@ h cut off those that have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land : where@@ fore then lay@@ est th@@ ou a sn@@ are for my life , to cause me to die ?
and the Lord hat@@ h done to him , as he sp@@ ake by me : for the Lord hat@@ h rent the k@@ ing@@ dom out of th@@ ine hand , and given it to TH@@ Y neighbour , even to David :
then Sa@@ ul fell stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay all along on the ear@@ th , and was sor@@ e afraid , because of the words of Samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had e@@ aten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
and the woman came un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and saw that he was sor@@ e troubled , and said un@@ to him , be@@ hold , th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id hat@@ h obe@@ yed TH@@ Y voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y words which th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est un@@ to me .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , he@@ arken th@@ ou also un@@ to the voice of th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before the@@ e ; and eat , that th@@ ou may@@ est have strength , when th@@ ou go@@ est on TH@@ Y way .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , Sa@@ ul sle@@ w his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore now rise up early in the morning with TH@@ Y master 's servants that are come with the@@ e : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had inv@@ aded the south , and Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and s@@ mit@@ ten Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ;
so David and his men came to the city , and , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
and they gave him a piece of a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and two clu@@ sters of ra@@ is@@ ins : and when he had e@@ aten , his spirit came again to him : for he had e@@ aten no bread , nor dr@@ un@@ k any water , three days and three n@@ ights .
and David smo@@ te them from the tw@@ il@@ ight even un@@ to the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which ro@@ de upon ca@@ me@@ ls , and fled .
for who will he@@ arken un@@ to you in this matter ? but as his part is that go@@ eth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tar@@ ri@@ eth by the stu@@ ff : they shall part alike .
and to them which were in R@@ ach@@ al , and to them which were in the cities of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ eli@@ tes , and to them which were in the cities of the Ken@@ ites ,
all the val@@ i@@ ant men ar@@ ose , and went all night , and took the body of Sa@@ ul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @@@ -@@ @ S@@ han , and came to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and bur@@ n@@ t them there .
now it came to pass after the death of Sa@@ ul , when David was returned from the sla@@ ughter of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and David had abo@@ de two days in Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g ;
it came even to pass on the third day , that , be@@ hold , a man came out of the camp from Sa@@ ul with his clo@@ th@@ es rent , and ear@@ th upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the ear@@ th , and did obe@@ is@@ ance .
and David said un@@ to him , Ho@@ w went the matter ? I pra@@ y the@@ e , tell me . and he answ@@ ered , That the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son are dead also .
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until even , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of He@@ br@@ on .
and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . and they told David , saying , That the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad were they that buried Sa@@ ul .
and David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers un@@ to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad , and said un@@ to them , b@@ les@@ sed be ye of the Lord , that ye have she@@ wed this kin@@ d@@ ness un@@ to your lor@@ d , even un@@ to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gi@@ be@@ on : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and th@@ rust his s@@ word in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : where@@ fore that place was called Hel@@ kat@@ h @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and A@@ sah@@ el pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Ab@@ ner .
and Ab@@ ner said to him , Tur@@ n the@@ e aside to TH@@ Y right hand or to TH@@ Y left , and lay the@@ e hold on one of the young men , and take the@@ e his arm@@ our . but A@@ sah@@ el would not turn aside from following of him .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David , that Ab@@ ner made himself strong for the house of Sa@@ ul .
now then do it : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken of David , saying , By the hand of my ser@@ vant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies .
and Ab@@ ner also sp@@ ake in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
when Jo@@ a@@ b and all the host that was with him were come , they told Jo@@ a@@ b , saying , Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er came to the king , and he hat@@ h sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
and the sons of R@@ im@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , Rec@@ ha@@ b and Ba@@ an@@ ah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ het@@ h , who lay on a bed at noon .
also in time past , when Sa@@ ul was king over us , th@@ ou w@@ ast he that led@@ dest out and b@@ rough@@ test in Israel : and the Lord said to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fe@@ ed my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be a captain over Israel .
and let it be , when th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound of a going in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then th@@ ou s@@ halt b@@ esti@@ r th@@ y@@ self : for then shall the Lord go out before the@@ e , to sm@@ ite the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and when they came to N@@ ach@@ on 's th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , Uz@@ z@@ ah put forth his hand to the Ar@@ k of God , and took hold of it ; for the ox@@ en sho@@ ok it .
so David would not remove the Ar@@ k of the Lord un@@ to him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and as the Ar@@ k of the Lord came into the city of David , Mic@@ hal Sa@@ ul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David le@@ ap@@ ing and dan@@ cing before the Lord ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
and they brought in the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and set it in his place , in the mid@@ st of the tab@@ ern@@ acle that David had pit@@ ched for it : and David offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before the Lord .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multi@@ tude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a c@@ ake of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine . so all the people depar@@ ted every one to his house .
and I will yet be more v@@ ile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the ma@@ id@@ servants which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
whereas I have not d@@ wel@@ t in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I was with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou w@@ en@@ test , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies out of TH@@ Y sight , and have made the@@ e a great name , like un@@ to the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and when TH@@ Y days be fulfilled , and th@@ ou s@@ halt sle@@ ep with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , I will set up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall proceed out of TH@@ Y bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and this was yet a small thing in TH@@ Y sight , O Lord God ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken also of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , O Lord God ?
and he smo@@ te Mo@@ a@@ b , and meas@@ ured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines meas@@ ured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Mo@@ abi@@ tes became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
then said Z@@ ib@@ a un@@ to the king , Accor@@ ding to all that my lor@@ d the king hat@@ h comman@@ ded his ser@@ vant , so shall TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do . as for M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the Syri@@ ans of Z@@ ob@@ a , and of Re@@ ho@@ b , and Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ to@@ b , and Ma@@ ac@@ ah , were by themselves in the field .
when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , then fled they also before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . so Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass in an even@@ ing@@ ti@@ de , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked upon the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman w@@ ashing her@@ self ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and when they had told David , saying , U@@ ri@@ ah went not down un@@ to his house , David said un@@ to U@@ ri@@ ah , C@@ ame@@ st th@@ ou not from TH@@ Y journey ? why then di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou not go down un@@ to th@@ ine house ?
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him dr@@ un@@ k : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lor@@ d , but went not down to his house .
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Jo@@ a@@ b , and sent it by the hand of U@@ ri@@ ah .
and if so be that the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore appro@@ ached ye so n@@ igh un@@ to the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
and I gave the@@ e TH@@ Y master 's house , and TH@@ Y master 's wi@@ ves into TH@@ Y bos@@ om , and gave the@@ e the house of Israel and of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given un@@ to the@@ e such and such things .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou desp@@ ised the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord , to do ev@@ il in his sight ? th@@ ou h@@ ast killed U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te with the s@@ word , and h@@ ast taken his wife to be TH@@ Y wife , and h@@ ast sla@@ in him with the s@@ word of the children of Am@@ mon .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will raise up ev@@ il against the@@ e out of th@@ ine own house , and I will take TH@@ Y wi@@ ves before th@@ ine eyes , and give them un@@ to TH@@ Y neighbour , and he shall lie with TH@@ Y wi@@ ves in the sight of this sun .
and the el@@ ders of his house ar@@ ose , and went to him , to raise him up from the ear@@ th : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
and he took their king 's cro@@ wn from off his head , the weight where@@ of was a tal@@ ent of gold with the pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : and it was set on David 's head . and he brought forth the sp@@ oil of the city in great ab@@ und@@ ance .
so Am@@ non lay down , and made himself si@@ ck : and when the king was come to see him , Am@@ non said un@@ to the king , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let Tam@@ ar my sister come , and make me a couple of cak@@ es in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
so Tam@@ ar went to her brother Am@@ non 's house ; and he was laid down . and she took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and made cak@@ es in his sight , and did bak@@ e the cak@@ es .
and I , w@@ hi@@ ther shall I cause my sh@@ ame to go ? and as for the@@ e , th@@ ou s@@ halt be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , speak un@@ to the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from the@@ e .
and she had a gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs upon her : for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that were vir@@ g@@ ins appar@@ elled . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and rent her gar@@ ment of di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on cr@@ ying .
and the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did un@@ to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had comman@@ ded . then all the king 's sons ar@@ ose , and every man g@@ at him up upon his mul@@ e , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hat@@ h sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and we@@ pt : and the king also and all his servants we@@ pt very sor@@ e .
now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing un@@ to my lor@@ d the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and TH@@ Y hand@@ ma@@ id said , I will now speak un@@ to the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his hand@@ ma@@ id .
then th@@ ine hand@@ ma@@ id said , The word of my lor@@ d the king shall now be comfortable : for as an an@@ gel of God , so is my lor@@ d the king to dis@@ cer@@ n good and bad : therefore the Lord TH@@ Y God will be with the@@ e .
and Jo@@ a@@ b fell to the ground on his face , and bo@@ wed himself , and thanked the king : and Jo@@ a@@ b said , To day TH@@ Y ser@@ vant know@@ eth that I have found grace in TH@@ Y sight , my lor@@ d , O king , in that the king hat@@ h fulfilled the request of his ser@@ vant .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year 's end that he polled it : because the ha@@ ir was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the ha@@ ir of his head at two hundred sh@@ ek@@ els after the king 's weight .
and it came to pass after for@@ ty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said un@@ to the king , I pra@@ y the@@ e , let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed un@@ to the Lord , in He@@ br@@ on .
and all his servants passed on bes@@ ide him ; and all the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and all the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the G@@ itti@@ tes , six hundred men which came after him from G@@ ath , passed on before the king .
and all the country we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
and lo Zad@@ ok also , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes were with him , bearing the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of God : and they set down the Ar@@ k of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and David went up by the as@@ cent of mount Oli@@ vet , and we@@ pt as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he wor@@ shi@@ pped God , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at rent , and ear@@ th upon his head :
and h@@ ast th@@ ou not there with the@@ e Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt hear out of the king 's house , th@@ ou s@@ halt tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them ye shall send un@@ to me every thing that ye can hear .
and when king David came to Ba@@ hur@@ im , be@@ hold , th@@ ence came out a man of the family of the house of Sa@@ ul , whose name was Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of Ger@@ a : he came forth , and Cur@@ sed still as he came .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
and I will come upon him while he is we@@ ary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will sm@@ ite the king only :
for , said Hus@@ hai , th@@ ou know@@ est TH@@ Y father and his men , that they be m@@ igh@@ ty men , and they be c@@ haf@@ ed in their min@@ ds , as a bear ro@@ bbed of her whel@@ ps in the field : and TH@@ Y father is a man of war , and will not lo@@ dge with the people .
and he also that is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t : for all Israel know@@ eth that TH@@ Y father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and they which be with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew fal@@ le@@ th on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
moreover , if he be gotten into a city , then shall all Israel bring ro@@ pes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone found there .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om and all the men of Israel said , The coun@@ sel of Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite is better than the coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el . for the Lord had appointed to defeat the good coun@@ sel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el , to the intent that the Lord might bring ev@@ il upon Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his coun@@ sel was not followed , he s@@ add@@ led his ass , and ar@@ ose , and g@@ at him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and han@@ ged himself , and died , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om made A@@ masa captain of the host instead of Jo@@ a@@ b : which A@@ masa was a man 's son , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra an Isra@@ elite , that went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
and Jo@@ a@@ b came into the house to the king , and said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast sha@@ med this day the faces of all TH@@ Y servants , which this day have sav@@ ed TH@@ Y life , and the lives of TH@@ Y sons and of TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the lives of TH@@ Y wi@@ ves , and the lives of TH@@ Y conc@@ ub@@ ines ;
for TH@@ Y ser@@ vant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , be@@ hold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king .
and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul came down to meet the king , and had neither d@@ ressed his feet , nor tri@@ m@@ med his be@@ ard , nor was@@ hed his clo@@ th@@ es , from the day the king depar@@ ted until the day he came again in peace .
and there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men : and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
but the king spar@@ ed M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , the son of Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul , because of the Lord 's oath that was between them , between David and Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ p@@ ah the daughter of A@@ i@@ ah , whom she b@@ are un@@ to Sa@@ ul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ; and the five sons of Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul , whom she brought up for Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the Me@@ ho@@ la@@ th@@ ite :
and the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Ze@@ lah , in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king comman@@ ded . and after that God was in@@ treated for the land .
and there was again a battle in Go@@ b with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , where El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are @@@ -@@ @ o@@ regi@@ m , a B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite , sle@@ w the brother of Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
and there was yet a battle in G@@ ath , where was a man of great stat@@ ure , that had on every hand six fin@@ gers , and on every fo@@ ot six to@@ es , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
and David sp@@ ake un@@ to the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
the God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , my high to@@ wer , and my ref@@ uge , my sa@@ vi@@ our ; th@@ ou sav@@ est me from violence .
in my dist@@ ress I called upon the Lord , and cri@@ ed to my God : and he did hear my voice out of his temp@@ le , and my cry did enter into his e@@ ars .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the re@@ bu@@ king of the Lord , at the blast of the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils .
then did I beat them as small as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , I did stamp them as the m@@ ire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
T@@ ho@@ u also h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people , th@@ ou h@@ ast kept me to be head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
and that br@@ ing@@ eth me forth from mine enem@@ ies : th@@ ou also h@@ ast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of J@@ es@@ se said , and the man who was raised up on high , the ano@@ in@@ ted of the God of Jac@@ o@@ b , and the swe@@ et p@@ sal@@ mist of Israel , said ,
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun ris@@ eth , even a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds ; as the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ inging out of the ear@@ th by clear sh@@ ining after rain .
these be the names of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had : the T@@ ach@@ mon@@ ite that sat in the seat , chief among the cap@@ tains ; the same was Ad@@ ino the E@@ z@@ n@@ ite : he lift up his spe@@ ar against eight hundred , whom he sle@@ w at one time .
and after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of len@@ ti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time un@@ to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines pit@@ ched in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and the three m@@ igh@@ ty men br@@ ake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink there@@ of , but p@@ oured it out un@@ to the Lord .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man , of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done many acts , he sle@@ w two li@@ on@@ like men of Mo@@ a@@ b : he went down also and sle@@ w a lion in the mid@@ st of a p@@ it in time of snow :
and he sle@@ w an Egyptian , a good@@ ly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and p@@ lu@@ cked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and sle@@ w him with his own spe@@ ar .
for the king said to Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host , which was with him , G@@ o now through all the tri@@ bes of Israel , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , and number ye the people , that I may know the number of the people .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the king 's word prev@@ ailed against Jo@@ a@@ b , and against the cap@@ tains of the host . and Jo@@ a@@ b and the cap@@ tains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the strong hold of T@@ y@@ re , and to all the cities of the H@@ ibi@@ tes , and of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites : and they went out to the south of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the number of the people un@@ to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men that drew the s@@ word ; and the men of Ju@@ da@@ h were five hundred thousand men .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore his servants said un@@ to him , Let there be sought for my lor@@ d the king a young vir@@ gin : and let her stand before the king , and let her ch@@ er@@ ish him , and let her lie in TH@@ Y bos@@ om , that my lor@@ d the king may get heat .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men which belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
and he hat@@ h sla@@ in ox@@ en and f@@ at c@@ attle and she@@ ep in ab@@ und@@ ance , and hat@@ h called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ est , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host : but Solomon TH@@ Y ser@@ vant hat@@ h he not called .
and th@@ ou , my lor@@ d , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon the@@ e , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest tell them who shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of my lor@@ d the king after him .
and they told the king , saying , be@@ hold Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t . and when he was come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
even as I sw@@ are un@@ to the@@ e by the Lord God of Israel , saying , As@@ su@@ red@@ ly Solomon TH@@ Y son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my th@@ r@@ one in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my th@@ r@@ one ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ru@@ ler over Israel and over Ju@@ da@@ h .
so Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mul@@ e , and brought him to G@@ ih@@ on .
and all the people came up after him , and the people pip@@ ed with pip@@ es , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy , so that the ear@@ th rent with the sound of them .
and the king hat@@ h sent with him Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mul@@ e :
so Solomon th@@ rust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being pri@@ est un@@ to the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake concerning the house of E@@ li in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
then ti@@ dings came to Jo@@ a@@ b : for Jo@@ a@@ b had turned after Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , though he turned not after Ab@@ sal@@ om . and Jo@@ a@@ b fled un@@ to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Jo@@ a@@ b , and upon the head of his se@@ ed for ever : but upon David , and upon his se@@ ed , and upon his house , and upon his th@@ r@@ one , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
for it shall be , that on the day th@@ ou go@@ est out , and pass@@ est over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , th@@ ou s@@ halt know for certain that th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely die : TH@@ Y blood shall be upon th@@ ine own head .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shi@@ me@@ i ran away un@@ to A@@ ch@@ ish son of Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h king of G@@ ath . and they told Shi@@ me@@ i , saying , be@@ hold , TH@@ Y servants be in G@@ ath .
so the king comman@@ ded Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; which went out , and fell upon him , that he died . and the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in the hand of Solomon .
and I have also given the@@ e that which th@@ ou h@@ ast not asked , both ri@@ ches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like un@@ to the@@ e all TH@@ Y days .
and Solomon aw@@ oke ; and , be@@ hold , it was a dream . and he came to Jer@@ usalem , and stood before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , and offered up bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and offered peace offer@@ ings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no st@@ ran@@ ger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and when I rose in the morning to give my child su@@ ck , be@@ hold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , be@@ hold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
Ba@@ ana the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud ; to him per@@ tained Ta@@ an@@ ach and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and all Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean , which is by Z@@ art@@ an@@ ah ben@@ e@@ ath J@@ ez@@ reel , from Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean to A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ ho@@ lah , even un@@ to the place that is beyond Jok@@ ne@@ am :
the son of Ge@@ ber , in Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad ; to him per@@ tained the towns of J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which are in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; to him also per@@ tained the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , which is in B@@ ash@@ an , thre@@ es@@ core great cities with walls and br@@ as@@ en bars :
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , in the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had domin@@ ion over all the region on this side the river , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Az@@ z@@ ah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and he sp@@ ake of trees , from the c@@ ed@@ ar tree that is in Lebanon even un@@ to the hy@@ s@@ so@@ p that spr@@ ing@@ eth out of the wall : he sp@@ ake also of be@@ asts , and of fo@@ w@@ l , and of cre@@ eping things , and of fis@@ hes .
bes@@ ide the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eigh@@ ti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Z@@ if , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length there@@ of was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the por@@ ch before the temp@@ le of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was the length there@@ of , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house ; and ten cu@@ bi@@ ts was the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built ch@@ ambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle : and he made ch@@ ambers round about :
the ne@@ ther@@ most chamber was five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the middle was six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad , and the third was seven cu@@ bi@@ ts broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narro@@ wed rests round about , that the be@@ ams should not be fas@@ tened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought th@@ ither : so that there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
concerning this house which th@@ ou art in building , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk in my stat@@ utes , and exec@@ ute my judg@@ ments , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with the@@ e , which I sp@@ ake un@@ to David TH@@ Y father :
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of c@@ ed@@ ar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the ci@@ el@@ ing : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with plan@@ ks of f@@ ir .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in length , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in b@@ read@@ th , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in the he@@ ight there@@ of : and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold ; and so covered the alt@@ ar which was of c@@ ed@@ ar .
and the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole alt@@ ar that was by the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
and five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he set the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms within the in@@ ner house : and they stret@@ ched forth the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b touched the other wall ; and their w@@ ings touched one another in the mid@@ st of the house .
the two doors also were of olive tree ; and he car@@ ved upon them car@@ v@@ ings of ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms and pal@@ m trees and open flowers , and over@@ laid them with gold , and spread gold upon the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and upon the pal@@ m trees .
and in the ele@@ venth year , in the month B@@ ul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts there@@ of , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and he made a por@@ ch of pil@@ lars ; the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pil@@ lars and the th@@ ick be@@ am were before them .
and he made two chap@@ it@@ ers of m@@ ol@@ ten br@@ ass , to set upon the tops of the pil@@ lars : the he@@ ight of the one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight of the other chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts :
and n@@ ets of chec@@ ker work , and w@@ re@@ aths of chain work , for the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ; seven for the one chap@@ iter , and seven for the other chap@@ iter .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers upon the two pil@@ lars had po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates also above , over against the bel@@ ly which was by the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred in ro@@ ws round about upon the other chap@@ iter .
and he set up the pil@@ lars in the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called the name there@@ of J@@ ach@@ in : and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and he called the name there@@ of Bo@@ az .
and he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea , ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from the one bri@@ m to the other : it was round all about , and his he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
and on the borders that were between the led@@ ges were li@@ ons , ox@@ en , and ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms : and upon the led@@ ges there was a base above : and ben@@ e@@ ath the li@@ ons and ox@@ en were certain addi@@ tions made of th@@ in work .
and under the borders were four whe@@ els ; and the ax@@ let@@ re@@ es of the whe@@ els were joined to the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and a half a cu@@ bit .
and the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ let@@ re@@ es , and their nav@@ es , and their fel@@ lo@@ es , and their spok@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
and in the top of the base was there a round comp@@ ass of half a cu@@ bit high : and on the top of the base the led@@ ges there@@ of and the borders there@@ of were of the same .
for on the plates of the led@@ ges there@@ of , and on the borders there@@ of , he gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , li@@ ons , and pal@@ m trees , according to the pro@@ portion of every one , and addi@@ tions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eas@@ tw@@ ard over against the south .
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers that were on the top of the two pil@@ lars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ons , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the cen@@ s@@ ers of p@@ ure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the in@@ ner house , the most hol@@ y place , and for the doors of the house , to w@@ it , of the temp@@ le .
so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the chief of the fa@@ thers of the children of Israel , un@@ to king Solomon in Jer@@ usalem , that they might bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k of the Lord , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , even those did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and ox@@ en , that could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord un@@ to his place , into the or@@ acle of the house , to the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms .
and they drew out the st@@ aves , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen out in the hol@@ y place before the or@@ acle , and they were not seen without : and there they are un@@ to this day .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k save the two tables of stone , which Mos@@ es put there at Ho@@ re@@ b , when the Lord made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests were come out of the hol@@ y place , that the cl@@ oud filled the house of the Lord ,
and the Lord hat@@ h performed his word that he sp@@ ake , and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and I have set there a place for the Ar@@ k , where@@ in is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
who h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that th@@ ou promis@@ ed@@ st him : th@@ ou sp@@ ak@@ est also with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
yet have th@@ ou respect un@@ to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and to the pray@@ er , which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e to day :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which th@@ ou h@@ ast said , My name shall be there : that th@@ ou may@@ est he@@ arken un@@ to the pray@@ er which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant shall make toward this place .
and he@@ arken th@@ ou to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place : and hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place : and when th@@ ou hear@@ est , for@@ give .
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and do , and judge TH@@ Y servants , condemning the w@@ ic@@ ked , to bring his way upon his head ; and jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , to give him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y servants , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , that th@@ ou te@@ ach them the good way where@@ in they should walk , and give rain upon TH@@ Y land , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given to TH@@ Y people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
what pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation so@@ ever be made by any man , or by all TH@@ Y people Israel , which shall know every man the pla@@ gue of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear th@@ ou in heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou , even th@@ ou only , know@@ est the hear@@ ts of all the children of men ; )
( for they shall hear of TH@@ Y great name , and of TH@@ Y strong hand , and of TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
if TH@@ Y people go out to battle against their enemy , w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and shall pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for TH@@ Y name :
if they sin against the@@ e , ( for there is no man that sin@@ net@@ h not , ) and th@@ ou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tives un@@ to the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall be@@ think themselves in the land w@@ hi@@ ther they were carried cap@@ tives , and rep@@ ent , and make supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the@@ e in the land of them that carried them cap@@ tives , saying , We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ ver@@ sely , we have committed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess ;
and so return un@@ to the@@ e with all their heart , and with all their sou@@ l , in the land of their enem@@ ies , which led them away cap@@ tive , and pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward their land , which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers , the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name :
and for@@ give TH@@ Y people that have sin@@ ned against the@@ e and all their trans@@ gres@@ sions where@@ in they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against the@@ e , and give them comp@@ as@@ sion before them who carried them cap@@ tive , that they may have comp@@ as@@ sion on them :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of TH@@ Y people Israel , to he@@ arken un@@ to them in all that they call for un@@ to the@@ e .
and it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation un@@ to the Lord , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of the Lord , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread up to heav@@ en .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord , that hat@@ h given rest un@@ to his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hat@@ h not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Mos@@ es his ser@@ vant .
that he may inc@@ line our hear@@ ts un@@ to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , and his judg@@ ments , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers .
and let these my words , where@@ with I have made supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord , be n@@ igh un@@ to the Lord our God day and night , that he maintain the cause of his ser@@ vant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
and if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk before me , as David TH@@ Y father walked , in integrity of heart , and in u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , to do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and w@@ il@@ t keep my stat@@ utes and my judg@@ ments :
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David TH@@ Y father , saying , There shall not fail the@@ e a man upon the th@@ r@@ one of Israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my comman@@ d@@ ments and my stat@@ utes which I have set before you , but go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them :
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hal@@ low@@ ed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a pro@@ ver@@ b and a by@@ word among all people :
and at this house , which is high , every one that pass@@ eth by it shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in the city , and given it for a present un@@ to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the cities of store that Solomon had , and cities for his char@@ i@@ ots , and cities for his hor@@ se@@ men , and that which Solomon desi@@ red to build in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his domin@@ ion .
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able ut@@ ter@@ ly to destroy , upon those did Solomon lev@@ y a tri@@ bute of bon@@ d@@ service un@@ to this day .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fif@@ ty , which b@@ are rule over the people that w@@ rought in the work .
and king Solomon made a nav@@ y of ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ ber , which is bes@@ ide E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
and she came to Jer@@ usalem with a very great train , with ca@@ me@@ ls that b@@ are sp@@ ices , and very much gold , and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she commun@@ ed with him of all that was in her heart .
bes@@ ide that he had of the mer@@ chan@@ t@@ men , and of the traffic@@ k of the sp@@ ice mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and a char@@ i@@ ot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and an hor@@ se for an hundred and fif@@ ty : and so for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wi@@ ves turned away his heart after other go@@ ds : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then did Solomon build an high place for Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of Mo@@ a@@ b , in the hill that is before Jer@@ usalem , and for Mo@@ le@@ ch , the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the children of Am@@ mon .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord said un@@ to Solomon , For@@ as@@ much as this is done of the@@ e , and th@@ ou h@@ ast not kept my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and my stat@@ utes , which I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , I will su@@ rely ren@@ d the k@@ ing@@ dom from the@@ e , and will give it to TH@@ Y ser@@ vant .
for it came to pass , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was gone up to bur@@ y the sla@@ in , after he had s@@ mit@@ ten every male in E@@ dom ;
that Had@@ ad fled , he and certain E@@ dom@@ ites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Had@@ ad being yet a little child .
and they ar@@ ose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an : and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , un@@ to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him vic@@ tuals , and gave him land .
and when Had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and that Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the host was dead , Had@@ ad said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , Let me de@@ part , that I may go to mine own country .
and it came to pass at that time when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; and he had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am d@@ wel@@ t in Egypt ; )
and they sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , If th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t be a ser@@ vant un@@ to this people this day , and w@@ il@@ t serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be TH@@ Y servants for ever .
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men , which they had given him , and consul@@ ted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and the young men that were grown up with him sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou speak un@@ to this people that sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Th@@ y father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make th@@ ou it ligh@@ ter un@@ to us ; thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , My little fin@@ ger shall be th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's lo@@ ins .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the king hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord sp@@ ake by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite un@@ to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the tri@@ bute ; and all Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was come again , that they sent and called him un@@ to the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again un@@ to their lor@@ d , even un@@ to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall kill me , and go again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
the alt@@ ar also was rent , and the ashes p@@ oured out from the alt@@ ar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
now there d@@ wel@@ t an old pro@@ phe@@ t in Be@@ the@@ l ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l : the words which he had spoken un@@ to the king , them they told also to their father .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t that brought him back :
and he cri@@ ed un@@ to the man of God that came from Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord , For@@ as@@ much as th@@ ou h@@ ast dis@@ obe@@ yed the m@@ outh of the Lord , and h@@ ast not kept the comman@@ d@@ ment which the Lord TH@@ Y God comman@@ ded the@@ e ,
but ca@@ me@@ st back , and h@@ ast e@@ aten bread and dr@@ un@@ k water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to the@@ e , eat no bread , and drink no water ; TH@@ Y car@@ case shall not come un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of TH@@ Y fa@@ thers .
and it came to pass , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led for him the ass , to w@@ it , for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and sle@@ w him : and his car@@ case was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the car@@ case .
and , be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the car@@ case cast in the way , and the lion standing by the car@@ case : and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t d@@ wel@@ t .
and the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the car@@ case of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old pro@@ phe@@ t came to the city , to mour@@ n and to bur@@ y him .
and it came to pass , after he had buried him , that he sp@@ ake to his sons , saying , When I am dead , then bur@@ y me in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re where@@ in the man of God is buried ; lay my b@@ ones bes@@ ide his b@@ ones :
for the saying which he cri@@ ed by the word of the Lord against the alt@@ ar in Be@@ the@@ l , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samar@@ ia , shall su@@ rely come to pass .
and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and ar@@ ose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . but A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
and rent the k@@ ing@@ dom away from the house of David , and gave it the@@ e : and yet th@@ ou h@@ ast not been as my ser@@ vant David , who kept my comman@@ d@@ ments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but h@@ ast done ev@@ il above all that were before the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast gone and made the@@ e other go@@ ds , and m@@ ol@@ ten images , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger , and h@@ ast cast me behind TH@@ Y back :
him that di@@ eth of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth in the field shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and Ju@@ da@@ h did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they had committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their stead br@@ as@@ en shi@@ elds , and committed them un@@ to the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? and there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and all Cin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
then king A@@ SA made a proc@@ lamation throughout all Ju@@ da@@ h ; none was exemp@@ ted : and they took away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and the tim@@ ber there@@ of , where@@ with Ba@@ as@@ ha had buil@@ ded ; and king A@@ SA built with them Ge@@ ba of Benjamin , and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
and Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , consp@@ ired against him ; and Ba@@ as@@ ha smo@@ te him at G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ a@@ b and all Israel laid siege to G@@ ib@@ be@@ th@@ on .
because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provoc@@ ation where@@ with he provoked the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
For@@ as@@ much as I ex@@ al@@ ted the@@ e out of the d@@ ust , and made the@@ e pr@@ ince over my people Israel ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast walked in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and h@@ ast made my people Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with their sin@@ s ;
be@@ hold , I will take away the poster@@ ity of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and the poster@@ ity of his house ; and will make TH@@ Y house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
him that di@@ eth of Ba@@ as@@ ha in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and him that di@@ eth of his in the fields shall the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air eat .
now the rest of the acts of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his th@@ r@@ one , that he sle@@ w all the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha : he left him not one that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against a wall , neither of his k@@ ins@@ fol@@ ks , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of E@@ lah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and the people that were en@@ camp@@ ed heard say , Z@@ im@@ ri hat@@ h consp@@ ired , and hat@@ h also sla@@ in the king : where@@ fore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and it came to pass , when Z@@ im@@ ri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and bur@@ n@@ t the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sin@@ s which he sin@@ ned in doing ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , in walk@@ ing in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he w@@ rought , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
for he walked in all the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin , to prov@@ oke the Lord God of Israel to an@@ ger with their van@@ ities .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he she@@ wed , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and in the thirty and eighth year of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h began A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri to reign over Israel : and A@@ ha@@ b the son of Om@@ ri re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel in Samar@@ ia twenty and two years .
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , that he took to wife J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel the daughter of Eth@@ ba@@ al king of the Z@@ id@@ on@@ ians , and went and served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , The bar@@ rel of me@@ al shall not waste , neither shall the cr@@ use of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sen@@ de@@ th rain upon the ear@@ th .
and the bar@@ rel of me@@ al was@@ ted not , neither did the cr@@ use of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by Eli@@ j@@ ah .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mist@@ ress of the house , fell si@@ ck ; and his si@@ ck@@ ness was so sor@@ e , that there was no bre@@ ath left in him .
and he said un@@ to her , Gi@@ ve me TH@@ Y son . and he took him out of her bos@@ om , and carried him up into a lo@@ ft , where he abo@@ de , and laid him upon his own bed .
and Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him un@@ to his mother : and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , Se@@ e , TH@@ Y son li@@ vet@@ h .
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the Lord , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took an hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
was it not told my lor@@ d what I did when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel sle@@ w the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the Lord , how I hi@@ d an hundred men of the Lord 's pro@@ ph@@ ets by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water ?
and it came to pass , when mid@@ day was past , and they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bul@@ lock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and p@@ our it on the bur@@ n@@ t sacrifice , and on the wood .
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he cast himself down upon the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es ,
and when he saw that , he ar@@ ose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h , and left his ser@@ vant there .
and he looked , and , be@@ hold , there was a c@@ ake bak@@ en on the co@@ als , and a cr@@ use of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and he came th@@ ither un@@ to a cave , and lo@@ d@@ ged there ; and , be@@ hold , the word of the Lord came to him , and he said un@@ to him , What do@@ est th@@ ou here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
and it was so , when Eli@@ j@@ ah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his man@@ tle , and went out , and stood in the entering in of the cave . and , be@@ hold , there came a voice un@@ to him , and said , What do@@ est th@@ ou here , Eli@@ j@@ ah ?
and it shall come to pass , that him that escap@@ eth the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el shall J@@ eh@@ u s@@ lay : and him that escap@@ eth from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u shall E@@ lis@@ ha s@@ lay .
and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and hor@@ ses , and char@@ i@@ ots : and he went up and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Samar@@ ia , and war@@ red against it .
yet I will send my servants un@@ to the@@ e to mor@@ row about this time , and they shall search th@@ ine house , and the houses of TH@@ Y servants ; and it shall be , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is pleas@@ ant in th@@ ine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad num@@ ber@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
and they pit@@ ched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel sle@@ w of the Syri@@ ans an hundred thousand foot@@ men in one day .
but the rest fled to A@@ ph@@ ek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left . and Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad fled , and came into the city , into an in@@ ner chamber .
so she wrote letters in A@@ ha@@ b 's name , and sealed them with his se@@ al , and sent the letters un@@ to the el@@ ders and to the no@@ bles that were in his city , d@@ wel@@ ling with Nab@@ o@@ th .
and set two men , sons of Bel@@ ial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent un@@ to them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent un@@ to them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon the@@ e , and will take away TH@@ Y poster@@ ity , and will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provoc@@ ation where@@ with th@@ ou h@@ ast provoked me to an@@ ger , and made Israel to sin .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat each on his th@@ r@@ one , having put on their rob@@ es , in a vo@@ id place in the entrance of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bo@@ w at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the har@@ ness : where@@ fore he said un@@ to the driver of his char@@ i@@ ot , Tur@@ n th@@ ine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and one was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot in the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they was@@ hed his arm@@ our ; according un@@ to the word of the Lord which he sp@@ ake .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ ha@@ b , and all that he did , and the Iv@@ ory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and he walked in all the ways of A@@ SA his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se yet in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he she@@ wed , and how he war@@ red , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin :
but the an@@ gel of the Lord said to Eli@@ j@@ ah the T@@ ish@@ bi@@ te , arise , go up to meet the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the king of Samar@@ ia , and say un@@ to them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b the go@@ d of E@@ kr@@ on ?
then the king sent un@@ to him a captain of fif@@ ty with his fif@@ ty . and he went up to him : and , be@@ hold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he sp@@ ake un@@ to him , T@@ ho@@ u man of God , the king hat@@ h said , C@@ ome down .
and he said , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if th@@ ou see me when I am taken from the@@ e , it shall be so un@@ to the@@ e ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , be@@ hold , there appeared a char@@ i@@ ot of fire , and hor@@ ses of fire , and par@@ ted them both as@@ under ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind into heav@@ en .
and E@@ lis@@ ha saw it , and he cri@@ ed , My father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ se@@ men there@@ of . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clo@@ th@@ es , and rent them in two pieces .
and he took the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and smo@@ te the waters , and said , W@@ here is the Lord God of Eli@@ j@@ ah ? and when he also had s@@ mit@@ ten the waters , they par@@ ted hi@@ ther and th@@ ither : and E@@ lis@@ ha went over .
and when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah do@@ th rest on E@@ lis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
and he went up from th@@ ence un@@ to Be@@ the@@ l : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mo@@ cked him , and said un@@ to him , G@@ o up , th@@ ou bal@@ d head ; go up , th@@ ou bal@@ d head .
and he turned back , and looked on them , and Cur@@ sed them in the name of the Lord . and there came forth two she be@@ ars out of the wood , and tar@@ e for@@ ty and two children of them .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the king of E@@ dom : and they f@@ et@@ ched a comp@@ ass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the c@@ attle that followed them .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , Y@@ e shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that val@@ ley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your c@@ attle , and your be@@ asts .
and it came to pass in the morning , when the meat offering was offered , that , be@@ hold , there came water by the way of E@@ dom , and the country was filled with water .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one upon the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes rose up and smo@@ te the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , so that they fled before them : but they went forward s@@ mit@@ ing the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , even in their country .
and when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too sor@@ e for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even un@@ to the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
then he took his el@@ dest son that should have re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead , and offered him for a bur@@ n@@ t offering upon the wall . and there was great in@@ dign@@ ation against Israel : and they depar@@ ted from him , and returned to their own land .
and she called un@@ to her husband , and said , S@@ end me , I pra@@ y the@@ e , one of the young men , and one of the ass@@ es , that I may run to the man of God , and come again .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his m@@ outh upon his m@@ outh , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stret@@ ched himself upon the child ; and the f@@ les@@ h of the child wa@@ xed warm .
and E@@ lis@@ ha came again to G@@ ilg@@ al : and there was a de@@ ar@@ th in the land ; and the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets were sitting before him : and he said un@@ to his ser@@ vant , S@@ et on the great po@@ t , and se@@ e@@ the po@@ tt@@ age for the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
so they p@@ oured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were e@@ ating of the po@@ tt@@ age , that they cri@@ ed out , and said , O th@@ ou man of God , there is death in the po@@ t . and they could not eat there@@ of .
now Na@@ aman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honour@@ able , because by him the Lord had given deliver@@ ance un@@ to Syria : he was also a m@@ igh@@ ty man in val@@ our , but he was a le@@ per .
and one went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , Th@@ us and thus said the ma@@ id that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come un@@ to the@@ e , be@@ hold , I have there@@ with sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to the@@ e , that th@@ ou may@@ est rec@@ over him of his le@@ pro@@ sy .
and it was so , when E@@ lis@@ ha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clo@@ th@@ es , that he sent to the king , saying , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore h@@ ast th@@ ou rent TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a pro@@ phe@@ t in Israel .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his f@@ les@@ h came again like un@@ to the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the to@@ wer , he took them from their hand , and bes@@ to@@ wed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sor@@ e troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said un@@ to them , Will ye not she@@ w me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when they were come into Samar@@ ia , that E@@ lis@@ ha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , be@@ hold , they were in the mid@@ st of Samar@@ ia .
and there was a great fam@@ ine in Samar@@ ia : and , be@@ hold , they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , until an ass 's head was sold for fo@@ ur@@ score pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a ca@@ b of do@@ ve 's D@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
and it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and , be@@ hold , he had s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th within upon his f@@ les@@ h .
and they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go un@@ to the camp of the Syri@@ ans : and when they were come to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
and they went after them un@@ to Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of gar@@ ments and vessels , which the Syri@@ ans had cast away in their has@@ te . and the mes@@ sen@@ gers returned , and told the king .
and the woman ar@@ ose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and she went forth to cry un@@ to the king for her house and for her land .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that he took a th@@ ick clo@@ th , and di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Haz@@ a@@ el re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b was his wife : and he did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord .
and the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
two and twenty years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned one year in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah , the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and did ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he was the son in law of the house of A@@ ha@@ b .
and when th@@ ou co@@ me@@ st th@@ ither , look out there J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his bre@@ th@@ ren , and carry him to an in@@ ner chamber ;
and he ar@@ ose , and went into the house ; and he p@@ oured the oil on his head , and said un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , I have ano@@ in@@ ted the@@ e king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ ha@@ b TH@@ Y master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish : and I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and sle@@ w sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent him them to J@@ ez@@ reel .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Y@@ e be righ@@ te@@ ous : be@@ hold , I consp@@ ired against my master , and sle@@ w him : but who sle@@ w all these ?
and when he came to Samar@@ ia , he sle@@ w all that remained un@@ to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , ti@@ ll he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
and J@@ eh@@ u sent through all Israel : and all the wor@@ ship@@ pers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was full from one end to another .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u depar@@ ted not from after them , to w@@ it , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but J@@ eh@@ u took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart : for he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , which made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
and he comman@@ ded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath shall even be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and ye shall comp@@ ass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that co@@ me@@ th within the ran@@ ges , let him be sla@@ in : and be ye with the king as he go@@ eth out and as he co@@ me@@ th in .
and the cap@@ tains over the hundreds did according to all things that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , with them that should go out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , and came to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right cor@@ ner of the temp@@ le to the left cor@@ ner of the temp@@ le , along by the alt@@ ar and the temp@@ le .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est comman@@ ded the cap@@ tains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said un@@ to them , H@@ ave her forth without the ran@@ ges : and him that follow@@ eth her kill with the s@@ word . for the pri@@ est had said , Let her not be sla@@ in in the house of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the hor@@ ses came into the king 's house : and there was she sla@@ in .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down ; his al@@ tar@@ s and his images br@@ ake they in pieces thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s . and the pri@@ est appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
and he took the rul@@ ers over hundreds , and the cap@@ tains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . and he sat on the th@@ r@@ one of the kings .
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the ch@@ est , that the king 's s@@ cri@@ be and the high pri@@ est came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the car@@ pen@@ ters and buil@@ ders , that w@@ rought upon the house of the Lord ,
and to mas@@ ons , and he@@ wers of stone , and to buy tim@@ ber and he@@ wed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the Lord bo@@ w@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ons , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , which made Israel to sin ; he depar@@ ted not there@@ from .
and the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ a@@ el , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a sa@@ vi@@ our , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syri@@ ans : and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their ten@@ ts , as be@@ fore@@ time .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?

now E@@ lis@@ ha was fallen si@@ ck of his si@@ ck@@ ness where@@ of he died . and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down un@@ to him , and we@@ pt over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the char@@ i@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ se@@ men there@@ of .
and it came to pass , as they were bur@@ ying a man , that , be@@ hold , they sp@@ ied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of E@@ lis@@ ha : and when the man was let down , and touched the b@@ ones of E@@ lis@@ ha , he revi@@ ved , and stood up on his feet .
and it came to pass , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was confirmed in his hand , that he sle@@ w his servants which had sla@@ in the king his father .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and came to Jer@@ usalem , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im un@@ to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and host@@ ages , and returned to Samar@@ ia .

and the Lord smo@@ te the king , so that he was a le@@ per un@@ to the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house . and Jo@@ th@@ am the king 's son was over the house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
and the rest of the acts of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as his fa@@ thers had done : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
for Men@@ a@@ hem the son of Gad@@ i went up from Tir@@ z@@ ah , and came to Samar@@ ia , and smo@@ te S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h in Samar@@ ia , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of S@@ hal@@ lum , and his con@@ spir@@ acy which he made , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not all his days from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Men@@ a@@ hem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?

and the rest of the acts of Pek@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord : he depar@@ ted not from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who made Israel to sin .
in the days of Pek@@ ah king of Israel came Ti@@ gla@@ th @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and took I@@ j@@ on , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ Beth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , and Jon@@ o@@ ah , and K@@ ede@@ sh , and Haz@@ or , and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and Gal@@ il@@ ee , all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and carried them cap@@ tive to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a con@@ spir@@ acy against Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
and the rest of the acts of Pek@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , ye@@ a , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
so A@@ haz sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to Ti@@ gla@@ th @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , saying , I am TH@@ Y ser@@ vant and TH@@ Y son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to him : for the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a went up against Dam@@ as@@ cus , and took it , and carried the people of it cap@@ tive to K@@ ir , and sle@@ w Re@@ z@@ in .
and when the king was come from Dam@@ as@@ cus , the king saw the alt@@ ar : and the king appro@@ ached to the alt@@ ar , and offered there@@ on .
and he brought also the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , which was before the Lord , from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between the alt@@ ar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the alt@@ ar .
and king A@@ haz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the lav@@ er from off them ; and took down the sea from off the br@@ as@@ en ox@@ en that were under it , and put it upon a pav@@ ement of stones .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and walked in the stat@@ utes of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secre@@ tly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the f@@ enced city .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they would not hear , but har@@ dened their nec@@ ks , like to the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a brought men from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and from Cu@@ th@@ ah , and from Av@@ a , and from Ham@@ ath , and from Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , and placed them in the cities of Samar@@ ia instead of the children of Israel : and they poss@@ essed Samar@@ ia , and d@@ wel@@ t in the cities there@@ of .
and so it was at the beginning of their d@@ wel@@ ling there , that they fear@@ ed not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent li@@ ons among them , which sle@@ w some of them .
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stret@@ ched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , and the law , and the comman@@ d@@ ment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for ever@@ more ; and ye shall not fear other go@@ ds .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and nine years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name also was A@@ bi , the daughter of Z@@ ac@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and br@@ ake the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves , and br@@ ake in pieces the br@@ as@@ en ser@@ p@@ ent that Mos@@ es had made : for un@@ to those days the children of Israel did bur@@ n incen@@ se to it : and he called it Ne@@ hus@@ h@@ tan .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a did carry away Israel un@@ to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des :
at that time did H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temp@@ le of the Lord , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent T@@ artan and R@@ ab@@ sar@@ is and Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a great host against Jer@@ usalem . and they went up and came to Jer@@ usalem . and when they were come up , they came and stood by the con@@ du@@ it of the up@@ per pool , which is in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
now , be@@ hold , th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test upon the staff of this bru@@ ised Re@@ ed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man le@@ an , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it : so is P@@ har@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt un@@ to all that trust on him .
now therefore , I pra@@ y the@@ e , give pledges to my lor@@ d the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will deliver the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h stood and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a :
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
then came Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es rent , and told him the words of Ra@@ b @@@ -@@ @ shak@@ e@@ h .
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed ; as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in T@@ hel@@ as@@ ar ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter of the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah pray@@ ed before the Lord , and said , O Lord God of Israel , which d@@ wel@@ lest between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , th@@ ou art the God , even th@@ ou alone , of all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th : th@@ ou h@@ ast made heav@@ en and ear@@ th .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , save th@@ ou us out of his hand , that all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th may know that th@@ ou art the Lord God , even th@@ ou only .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste f@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded ; they were as the gr@@ ass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as cor@@ n b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
because TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me and TH@@ Y t@@ um@@ ult is come up into mine e@@ ars , therefore I will put my ho@@ ok in TH@@ Y n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and I will turn the@@ e back by the way by which th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
and it came to pass that night , that the an@@ gel of the Lord went out , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans an hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons smo@@ te him with the s@@ word : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and E@@ sar @@@ -@@ @ h@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and it came to pass , a@@ fore I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
and I will add un@@ to TH@@ Y days fif@@ teen years ; and I will deliver the@@ e and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my ser@@ vant David 's sake .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store un@@ to this day , shall be carried into Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a con@@ du@@ it , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built up again the high places which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his father had destroyed ; and he re@@ ar@@ ed up al@@ tar@@ s for Ba@@ al , and made a gro@@ ve , as did A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel ; and wor@@ shi@@ pped all the host of heav@@ en , and served them .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and dealt with familiar spir@@ its and w@@ iz@@ ards : he w@@ rought much w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
and I will for@@ sake the re@@ mn@@ ant of mine inher@@ it@@ ance , and deliver them into the hand of their enem@@ ies ; and they shall become a pre@@ y and a sp@@ oil to all their enem@@ ies ;
because they have done that which was ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even un@@ to this day .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the gar@@ den of his own house , in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Am@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
Am@@ on was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th , the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
and the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Am@@ on which he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
Jos@@ i@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty and one years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ da@@ h , the daughter of A@@ dai@@ ah of Bos@@ c@@ ath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the ke@@ epers of the door have gathered of the people :
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est said un@@ to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Th@@ y servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sahi@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
so H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , and A@@ ch@@ bor , and Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ sahi@@ ah , went un@@ to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ v@@ ah , the son of Har@@ has , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem in the colle@@ ge ; ) and they commun@@ ed with her .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h hat@@ h read :
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wr@@ ath shall be kin@@ d@@ led against this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h which sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel , As tou@@ ching the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
be@@ hold therefore , I will gather the@@ e un@@ to TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be gathered into TH@@ Y grave in peace ; and th@@ ine eyes shall not see all the ev@@ il which I will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
and he brought out the gro@@ ve from the house of the Lord , without Jer@@ usalem , un@@ to the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and st@@ amp@@ ed it small to pow@@ der , and cast the pow@@ der there@@ of upon the graves of the children of the people .
and the al@@ tar@@ s that were on the top of the up@@ per chamber of A@@ haz , which the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h had made , and the al@@ tar@@ s which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down , and br@@ ake them down from th@@ ence , and cast the d@@ ust of them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samar@@ ia , which the kings of Israel had made to prov@@ oke the Lord to an@@ ger , Jos@@ i@@ ah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Be@@ the@@ l .
and like un@@ to him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his sou@@ l , and with all his might , according to all the law of Mos@@ es ; neither after him ar@@ ose there any like him .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing the Lord turned not from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , where@@ with his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ations that Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him with@@ al .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and his servants carried him in a char@@ i@@ ot dead from Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and buried him in his own se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re . and the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and ano@@ in@@ ted him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h made Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king in the room of Jos@@ i@@ ah his father , and turned his name to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ze@@ bu@@ da@@ h , the daughter of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah of Rum@@ ah .
and the Lord sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and bands of the Syri@@ ans , and bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Ju@@ da@@ h to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h went out to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his officers : and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried out th@@ ence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temp@@ le of the Lord , as the Lord had said .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he , and all his host , against Jer@@ usalem , and pit@@ ched against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
and they sle@@ w the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him with f@@ et@@ ters of br@@ ass , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan , captain of the guard , a ser@@ vant of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem :
and he bur@@ n@@ t the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and every great man 's house bur@@ n@@ t he with fire .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the re@@ mn@@ ant of the multi@@ tude , did Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the Lord , did the Chal@@ de@@ es break in pieces , and carried the br@@ ass of them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , ru@@ ler .
and when all the cap@@ tains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah governor , there came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah , and Johan@@ an the son of C@@ are@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of a Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , they and their men .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ es that were with him at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
and all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the armies , ar@@ ose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ es .
and his allow@@ ance was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .
and Can@@ a@@ an beg@@ at Z@@ id@@ on his fir@@ st@@ born , and H@@ eth ,
and Jok@@ tan beg@@ at Al@@ mo@@ dad , and She@@ le@@ p@@ h , and H@@ azar@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Jer@@ ah ,

now these are the kings that re@@ ig@@ ned in the land of E@@ dom before any king re@@ ig@@ ned over the children of Israel ; Bel@@ a the son of Be@@ or : and the name of his city was Din@@ ha@@ bah .
and when Hus@@ ham was dead , Had@@ ad the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , which smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
and when Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ han@@ an was dead , Had@@ ad re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pa@@ i ; and his wife 's name was Meh@@ et@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Mez@@ a@@ ha@@ b .
now the sons of Cal@@ e@@ b the brother of Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el were , Mes@@ ha his fir@@ st@@ born , which was the father of Z@@ ip@@ h ; and the sons of Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h the father of He@@ br@@ on .
now these were the sons of David , which were born un@@ to him in He@@ br@@ on ; the fir@@ st@@ born Am@@ non , of Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s ; the second Daniel , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s :
the sons of She@@ lah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h were , E@@ R the father of L@@ ec@@ ah , and La@@ ad@@ ah the father of Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h , and the families of the house of them that w@@ rought fine lin@@ en , of the house of Ash@@ be@@ a ,
and some of them , even of the sons of Simeon , five hundred men , went to mount Se@@ ir , having for their cap@@ tains Pe@@ la@@ ti@@ ah , and N@@ ear@@ i@@ ah , and Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , the sons of I@@ sh@@ i .
these are the children of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il the son of Hur@@ i , the son of Jar@@ o@@ ah , the son of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the son of Michael , the son of J@@ es@@ his@@ hai , the son of Jah@@ do , the son of B@@ uz ;
the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and half the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , of val@@ i@@ ant men , men able to bear bu@@ ck@@ ler and s@@ word , and to sho@@ ot with bo@@ w , and s@@ kil@@ ful in war , were four and for@@ ty thousand seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core , that went out to the war .
and these were the heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , even Ep@@ her , and I@@ sh@@ i , and Eli@@ el , and Az@@ ri@@ el , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and Ho@@ da@@ vi@@ ah , and Jah@@ di@@ el , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , famous men , and heads of the house of their fa@@ thers .
and they minist@@ ered before the d@@ wel@@ ling place of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation with singing , until Solomon had built the house of the Lord in Jer@@ usalem : and then they w@@ aited on their office according to their order .
now these are their d@@ wel@@ ling places throughout their c@@ ast@@ les in their co@@ asts , of the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : for the@@ ir@@ s was the lot .
and un@@ to the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h , which were left of the family of that tri@@ be , were cities given out of the half tri@@ be , name@@ ly , out of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , by lot , ten cities .
and to the sons of Ger@@ sho@@ m throughout their families out of the tri@@ be of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tri@@ be of As@@ her , and out of the tri@@ be of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of the tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in B@@ ash@@ an , thir@@ teen cities .
un@@ to the sons of Mer@@ ari were given by lot , throughout their families , out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , and out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , twelve cities .
and they gave by lot out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin , these cities , which are called by their names .
and on the other side Jordan by Jer@@ ich@@ o , on the east side of Jordan , were given them out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , B@@ ez@@ er in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with her subur@@ bs , and Jah@@ z@@ ah with her subur@@ bs ,
and the sons of Bel@@ a ; E@@ z@@ bon , and Uz@@ zi , and Uz@@ zi@@ el , and Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th , and I@@ RI , five ; heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our ; and were rec@@ kon@@ ed by their gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four .
and the number of them , after their gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy by their generations , heads of the house of the fa@@ thers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , was twenty thousand and two hundred .
all these the sons of J@@ edi@@ a@@ el , by the heads of their fa@@ thers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , were se@@ ven@@ teen thousand and two hundred soldiers , fit to go out for war and battle .
and Rep@@ ha@@ h was his son , also Res@@ hep@@ h , and Te@@ lah his son , and Tah@@ an his son ,
and their pos@@ sessions and habi@@ tations were , Be@@ the@@ l and the towns there@@ of , and eas@@ tw@@ ard Na@@ ar@@ an , and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard Ge@@ zer , with the towns there@@ of ; Sh@@ ec@@ hem also and the towns there@@ of , un@@ to Gaza and the towns there@@ of :
and by the borders of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Beth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ ean and her towns , Ta@@ an@@ ach and her towns , Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do and her towns , D@@ or and her towns . in these d@@ wel@@ t the children of Joseph the son of Israel .
all these were the children of As@@ her , heads of their father 's house , choice and m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , chief of the pr@@ inces . and the number throughout the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of them that were ap@@ t to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
U@@ th@@ ai the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud , the son of Om@@ ri , the son of Im@@ ri , the son of Ban@@ i , of the children of P@@ har@@ ez the son of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and I@@ b@@ ne@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and E@@ lah the son of Uz@@ zi , the son of Mic@@ hri , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of S@@ hep@@ ha@@ th@@ i@@ ah , the son of Re@@ uel , the son of I@@ b@@ ni@@ j@@ ah ;
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , according to their generations , nine hundred and fif@@ ty and six . all these men were chief of the fa@@ thers in the house of their fa@@ thers .
and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the house of God ;
and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah , and Ma@@ asi@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of Jah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ lem@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , heads of the house of their fa@@ thers , a thousand and seven hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God .
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of A@@ SA , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
all these which were chosen to be por@@ ters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were rec@@ kon@@ ed by their gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the se@@ er did or@@ da@@ in in their set office .
so they and their children had the over@@ sight of the gates of the house of the Lord , name@@ ly , the house of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , by wards .
some of them also were appointed to over@@ see the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .
and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , one of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who was the fir@@ st@@ born of S@@ hal@@ lum the Kor@@ ah@@ ite , had the set office over the things that were made in the p@@ ans .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard after Sa@@ ul , and after his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines sle@@ w Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ u@@ a , the sons of Sa@@ ul .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the val@@ ley saw that they fled , and that Sa@@ ul and his sons were dead , then they for@@ so@@ ok their cities , and fled : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
they ar@@ ose , all the val@@ i@@ ant men , and took away the body of Sa@@ ul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and buried their b@@ ones under the o@@ ak in J@@ ab@@ es@@ h , and fas@@ ted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Sa@@ ul was king , th@@ ou w@@ ast he that led@@ dest out and b@@ rough@@ test in Israel : and the Lord TH@@ Y God said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fe@@ ed my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be ru@@ ler over my people Israel , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be ru@@ ler over my people Israel .
these also are the chief of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his k@@ ing@@ dom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
and the three br@@ ake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but p@@ oured it out to the Lord ,
Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ z@@ e@@ el , who had done many acts ; he sle@@ w two li@@ on@@ like men of Mo@@ a@@ b : also he went down and sle@@ w a lion in a p@@ it in a snow@@ y day .
now these are they that came to David to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , while he yet kept himself close because of Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish : and they were among the m@@ igh@@ ty men , hel@@ pers of the war .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flo@@ wn all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to He@@ br@@ on , to turn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Sa@@ ul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
and of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their bre@@ th@@ ren were at their comman@@ d@@ ment .
and on the other side of Jordan , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and of the half tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , with all manner of instruments of war for the battle , an hundred and twenty thousand .
so David brought not the Ar@@ k home to himself to the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom the G@@ itti@@ te .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou s@@ halt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then th@@ ou s@@ halt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before the@@ e to sm@@ ite the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are the chief of the fa@@ thers of the L@@ evi@@ tes : sanc@@ ti@@ fy yo@@ ur@@ selves , both ye and your bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye may bring up the Ar@@ k of the Lord God of Israel un@@ to the place that I have prepared for it .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes to appoint their bre@@ th@@ ren to be the singers with instruments of musi@@ ck , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his bre@@ th@@ ren , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their bre@@ th@@ ren , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
so David , and the el@@ ders of Israel , and the cap@@ tains over thousands , went to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom with joy .
and David was clo@@ th@@ ed with a ro@@ be of fine lin@@ en , and all the L@@ evi@@ tes that b@@ are the Ar@@ k , and the singers , and Chen@@ an@@ i@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ep@@ ho@@ d of lin@@ en .
thus all Israel brought up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with sound of the cor@@ net , and with tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , making a no@@ ise with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps .
and it came to pass , as the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord came to the city of David , that Mic@@ hal the daughter of Sa@@ ul looking out at a window saw king David dan@@ cing and playing : and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a good piece of f@@ les@@ h , and a fla@@ g@@ on of wine .
so he left there before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord A@@ sap@@ h and his bre@@ th@@ ren , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required :
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord upon the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he comman@@ ded Israel ;
and I have been with the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou h@@ ast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enem@@ ies from before the@@ e , and have made the@@ e a name like the name of the great men that are in the ear@@ th .
and it shall come to pass , when TH@@ Y days be expired that th@@ ou must go to be with TH@@ Y fa@@ thers , that I will raise up TH@@ Y se@@ ed after the@@ e , which shall be of TH@@ Y sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
and yet this was a small thing in th@@ ine eyes , O God ; for th@@ ou h@@ ast also spoken of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant 's house for a great while to come , and h@@ ast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
them also king David dedicated un@@ to the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ a@@ b , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
and the children of Am@@ mon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
and he said , If the Syri@@ ans be too strong for me , then th@@ ou s@@ halt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for the@@ e , then I will help the@@ e .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans were fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b came to Jer@@ usalem .
and when the Syri@@ ans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and drew forth the Syri@@ ans that were beyond the river : and S@@ hop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and David took the cro@@ wn of their king from off his head , and found it to we@@ igh a tal@@ ent of gold , and there were pre@@ ci@@ ous stones in it ; and it was set upon David 's head : and he brought also exceeding much sp@@ oil out of the city .
and it came to pass after this , that there ar@@ ose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; at which time Si@@ b@@ bec@@ hai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite sle@@ w S@@ ip@@ p@@ ai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were sub@@ du@@ ed .
and yet again there was war at G@@ ath , where was a man of great stat@@ ure , whose fin@@ gers and to@@ es were four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each fo@@ ot : and he also was the son of the giant .
and Jo@@ a@@ b gave the sum of the number of the people un@@ to David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew s@@ word : and Ju@@ da@@ h was four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand men that drew s@@ word .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord comman@@ ded G@@ ad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an alt@@ ar un@@ to the Lord in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
and as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord , which Mos@@ es made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the alt@@ ar of the bur@@ n@@ t offering , were at that season in the high place at Gi@@ be@@ on .
but the word of the Lord came to me , saying , T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast shed blood ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and h@@ ast made great wars : th@@ ou s@@ halt not build an house un@@ to my name , because th@@ ou h@@ ast shed much blood upon the ear@@ th in my sight .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou prosp@@ er , if th@@ ou tak@@ est heed to fulfil the stat@@ utes and judg@@ ments which the Lord charged Mos@@ es with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dre@@ ad not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed .
now , be@@ hold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand tal@@ ents of gold , and a thousand thousand tal@@ ents of silver ; and of br@@ ass and iron without weight ; for it is in ab@@ und@@ ance : tim@@ ber also and stone have I prepared ; and th@@ ou may@@ est add there@@ to .
the sons of Am@@ ram ; Aaron and Mos@@ es : and Aaron was separated , that he should sanc@@ ti@@ fy the most hol@@ y things , he and his sons for ever , to bur@@ n incen@@ se before the Lord , to minister un@@ to him , and to b@@ less in his name for ever .
these were the sons of L@@ evi after the house of their fa@@ thers ; even the chief of the fa@@ thers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and up@@ ward .
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the ch@@ ambers , and in the pur@@ ifying of all hol@@ y things , and the work of the service of the house of God ;
and there were more chief men found of the sons of Ele@@ azar than of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of Ele@@ azar there were six@@ teen chief men of the house of their fa@@ thers , and eight among the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar according to the house of their fa@@ thers .
thus were they divided by lot , one sort with another ; for the govern@@ ors of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and govern@@ ors of the house of God , were of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar .
these were the or@@ der@@ ings of them in their service to come into the house of the Lord , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the Lord God of Israel had comman@@ ded him .
moreover David and the cap@@ tains of the host separated to the service of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , and of H@@ eman , and of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , who should pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y with har@@ ps , with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als : and the number of the work@@ men according to their service was :
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the Lord , with cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and har@@ ps , for the service of the house of God , according to the king 's order to A@@ sap@@ h , J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and H@@ eman .
so the number of them , with their bre@@ th@@ ren that were instruc@@ ted in the songs of the Lord , even all that were c@@ un@@ ning , was two hundred fo@@ ur@@ score and eight .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons ; Sim@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him the chief ; )
which S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith and his bre@@ th@@ ren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fa@@ thers , the cap@@ tains over thousands and hundreds , and the cap@@ tains of the host , had dedicated .
and all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Sa@@ ul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith , and of his bre@@ th@@ ren .
among the He@@ bron@@ ites was Jer@@ ij@@ ah the chief , even among the He@@ bron@@ ites , according to the generations of his fa@@ thers . in the for@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our at Jaz@@ er of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
and over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the sto@@ re@@ houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the c@@ ast@@ les , was J@@ eh@@ on@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hat@@ h given me many sons , ) he hat@@ h chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom of the Lord over Israel .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pat@@ tern of the por@@ ch , and of the houses there@@ of , and of the treas@@ ur@@ ies there@@ of , and of the up@@ per ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and of the in@@ ner par@@ lo@@ urs there@@ of , and of the place of the mer@@ cy seat ,
and the pat@@ tern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the ch@@ ambers round about , of the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the house of God , and of the treas@@ ur@@ ies of the dedicated things :
also for the courses of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of gold , and for their lam@@ ps of gold , by weight for every cand@@ le@@ stick , and for the lam@@ ps there@@ of : and for the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks of silver by weight , both for the cand@@ le@@ stick , and also for the lam@@ ps there@@ of , according to the use of every cand@@ le@@ stick .
and for the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se refin@@ ed gold by weight ; and gold for the pat@@ tern of the char@@ i@@ ot of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , that spread out their w@@ ings , and covered the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord .
moreover , because I have set my aff@@ ection to the house of my God , I have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the hol@@ y house ,
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of arti@@ fic@@ ers . and who then is willing to consec@@ rate his service this day un@@ to the Lord ?
Th@@ ine , O Lord , is the gre@@ at@@ ness , and the power , and the gl@@ ory , and the victory , and the maj@@ es@@ ty : for all that is in the heav@@ en and in the ear@@ th is th@@ ine ; th@@ ine is the k@@ ing@@ dom , O Lord , and th@@ ou art ex@@ al@@ ted as head above all .
both ri@@ ches and honour come of the@@ e , and th@@ ou re@@ ign@@ est over all ; and in th@@ ine hand is power and might ; and in th@@ ine hand it is to make great , and to give strength un@@ to all .
and give un@@ to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments , TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , and TH@@ Y stat@@ utes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es un@@ to the Lord , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings un@@ to the Lord , on the mor@@ row after that day , even a thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks , a thousand r@@ ams , and a thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance for all Israel :
now the acts of David the king , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of Samuel the se@@ er , and in the book of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the book of G@@ ad the se@@ er ,
then Solomon sp@@ ake un@@ to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fa@@ thers .
so Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of the Lord had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
but the Ar@@ k of God had David brought up from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jer@@ usalem .
moreover the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , he put before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Con@@ gre@@ gation sought un@@ to it .
and they f@@ et@@ ched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a char@@ i@@ ot for six hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and an hor@@ se for an hundred and fif@@ ty : and so brought they out hor@@ ses for all the kings of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
and Solomon sent to Hur@@ am the king of T@@ y@@ re , saying , As th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st deal with David my father , and di@@ d@@ st send him c@@ ed@@ ars to build him an house to d@@ well there@@ in , even so deal with me .
and Solomon num@@ ber@@ ed all the st@@ ran@@ gers that were in the land of Israel , after the num@@ ber@@ ing where@@ with David his father had num@@ ber@@ ed them ; and they were found an hundred and fif@@ ty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jer@@ usalem in mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where the Lord appeared un@@ to David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the th@@ res@@ h@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instruc@@ ted for the building of the house of God . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and the por@@ ch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight was an hundred and twenty : and he over@@ laid it within with p@@ ure gold .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the posts , and the walls there@@ of , and the doors there@@ of , with gold ; and gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms on the walls .
and the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms were twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts long : one wing of the one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
and he made cha@@ ins , as in the or@@ acle , and put them on the heads of the pil@@ lars ; and made an hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the cha@@ ins .
and he re@@ ar@@ ed up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
also he made a m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the he@@ ight there@@ of ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts did comp@@ ass it round about .
and under it was the si@@ milit@@ u@@ de of ox@@ en , which did comp@@ ass it round about : ten in a cu@@ bit , comp@@ ass@@ ing the sea round about . two ro@@ ws of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hin@@ der parts were in@@ ward .
and the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of it was an hand@@ b@@ read@@ th , and the bri@@ m of it like the work of the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , with flowers of l@@ ilies ; and it received and held three thousand ba@@ ths .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temp@@ le , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred bas@@ ons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the pri@@ ests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and over@@ laid the doors of them with br@@ ass .
to w@@ it , the two pil@@ lars , and the pom@@ me@@ ls , and the chap@@ it@@ ers which were on the top of the two pil@@ lars , and the two w@@ re@@ aths to cover the two pom@@ me@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the sn@@ u@@ ffers , and the bas@@ ons , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the cen@@ s@@ ers , of p@@ ure gold : and the entry of the house , the in@@ ner doors there@@ of for the most hol@@ y place , and the doors of the house of the temp@@ le , were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished : and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
then Solomon assemb@@ led the el@@ ders of Israel , and all the heads of the tri@@ bes , the chief of the fa@@ thers of the children of Israel , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Z@@ ion .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tab@@ ern@@ acle , these did the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel that were assemb@@ led un@@ to him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed she@@ ep and ox@@ en , which could not be told nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
and the pri@@ ests brought in the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of the Lord un@@ to his place , to the or@@ acle of the house , into the most hol@@ y place , even under the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms :
and they drew out the st@@ aves of the Ar@@ k , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is un@@ to this day .
and it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests were come out of the hol@@ y place : ( for all the pri@@ ests that were present were sanc@@ ti@@ fied , and did not then wait by course :
but the Lord said to David my father , For@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
the Lord therefore hat@@ h performed his word that he hat@@ h spoken : for I am risen up in the room of David my father , and am set on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u which h@@ ast kept with TH@@ Y ser@@ vant David my father that which th@@ ou h@@ ast promised him ; and sp@@ ak@@ est with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and h@@ ast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
have respect therefore to the pray@@ er of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and to his supp@@ lic@@ ation , O Lord my God , to he@@ arken un@@ to the cry and the pray@@ er which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth before the@@ e :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place where@@ of th@@ ou h@@ ast said that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest put TH@@ Y name there ; to he@@ arken un@@ to the pray@@ er which TH@@ Y ser@@ vant pray@@ eth toward this place .
Hear@@ ken therefore un@@ to the supp@@ lic@@ ations of TH@@ Y ser@@ vant , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear th@@ ou from TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , even from heav@@ en ; and when th@@ ou hear@@ est , for@@ give .
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en , and do , and judge TH@@ Y servants , by requ@@ iting the w@@ ic@@ ked , by re@@ compen@@ sing his way upon his own head ; and by jus@@ tif@@ ying the righ@@ te@@ ous , by giving him according to his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
when the heav@@ en is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against the@@ e ; yet if they pra@@ y toward this place , and conf@@ ess TH@@ Y name , and turn from their sin , when th@@ ou dost aff@@ lic@@ t them ;
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of TH@@ Y servants , and of TH@@ Y people Israel , when th@@ ou h@@ ast ta@@ ught them the good way , where@@ in they should walk ; and send rain upon TH@@ Y land , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given un@@ to TH@@ Y people for an inher@@ it@@ ance .
then what pray@@ er or what supp@@ lic@@ ation so@@ ever shall be made of any man , or of all TH@@ Y people Israel , when every one shall know his own sor@@ e and his own gri@@ ef , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear th@@ ou from heav@@ en TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and for@@ give , and ren@@ der un@@ to every man according un@@ to all his ways , whose heart th@@ ou know@@ est ; ( for th@@ ou only know@@ est the hear@@ ts of the children of men : )
moreover concerning the st@@ ran@@ ger , which is not of TH@@ Y people Israel , but is come from a far country for TH@@ Y great name 's sake , and TH@@ Y m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and TH@@ Y stret@@ ched out arm ; if they come and pra@@ y in this house ;
if TH@@ Y people go out to war against their enem@@ ies by the way that th@@ ou s@@ halt send them , and they pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e toward this city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name ;
if they sin against the@@ e , ( for there is no man which sin@@ net@@ h not , ) and th@@ ou be angry with them , and deliver them over before their enem@@ ies , and they carry them away cap@@ tives un@@ to a land far off or near ;
yet if they be@@ think themselves in the land w@@ hi@@ ther they are carried cap@@ tive , and turn and pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , We have sin@@ ned , we have done am@@ is@@ s , and have dealt w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ;
if they return to the@@ e with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l in the land of their cap@@ tivity , w@@ hi@@ ther they have carried them cap@@ tives , and pra@@ y toward their land , which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to their fa@@ thers , and toward the city which th@@ ou h@@ ast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for TH@@ Y name :
now when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing , the fire came down from heav@@ en , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; and the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house .
and the pri@@ ests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the gl@@ ory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house .
moreover Solomon hal@@ low@@ ed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , because the br@@ as@@ en alt@@ ar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the meat offer@@ ings , and the f@@ at .
and on the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their ten@@ ts , glad and mer@@ ry in heart for the Go@@ od@@ ness that the Lord had she@@ wed un@@ to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house , he prosp@@ er@@ ously eff@@ ected .
if my people , which are called by my name , shall hum@@ ble themselves , and pra@@ y , and seek my face , and turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked ways ; then will I hear from heav@@ en , and will for@@ give their sin , and will he@@ al their land .
and as for the@@ e , if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t walk before me , as David TH@@ Y father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded the@@ e , and s@@ halt observe my stat@@ ues and my judg@@ ments ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Wh@@ y hat@@ h the Lord done thus un@@ to this land , and un@@ to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , where@@ in Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
and Ba@@ al@@ ath , and all the store cities that Solomon had , and all the char@@ i@@ ot cities , and the cities of the hor@@ se@@ men , and all that Solomon desi@@ red to build in Jer@@ usalem , and in Lebanon , and throughout all the land of his domin@@ ion .
as for all the people that were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , which were not of Israel ,
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Mos@@ es , on the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the so@@ lem@@ n fe@@ asts , three times in the year , even in the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , be@@ hold , the one half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom was not told me : for th@@ ou exce@@ ede@@ st the f@@ ame that I heard .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite , and in the visions of I@@ d@@ do the se@@ er against Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at ?
and it came to pass , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , who was in Egypt , w@@ hi@@ ther he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel which the old men gave him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and the young men that were brought up with him sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us s@@ halt th@@ ou answer the people that sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , saying , Th@@ y father made our yok@@ e heavy , but make th@@ ou it somewhat ligh@@ ter for us ; thus s@@ halt th@@ ou say un@@ to them , My little fin@@ ger shall be th@@ ic@@ ker than my father 's lo@@ ins .
so the king hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to the people : for the cause was of God , that the Lord might perform his word , which he sp@@ ake by the hand of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Had@@ or@@ am that was over the tri@@ bute ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . but king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jer@@ usalem , he gathered of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin an hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score thousand chosen men , which were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from exec@@ ut@@ ing the pri@@ est 's office un@@ to the Lord :
so they strengthened the k@@ ing@@ dom of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
and he dealt wis@@ ely , and disper@@ sed of all his children throughout all the countries of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , un@@ to every f@@ enced city : and he gave them vic@@ tual in ab@@ und@@ ance . and he desi@@ red many wi@@ ves .
and it came to pass , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had established the k@@ ing@@ dom , and had strengthened himself , he for@@ so@@ ok the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
so S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jer@@ usalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
instead of which king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king 's house .
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hat@@ h rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
but as for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not for@@ sak@@ en him ; and the pri@@ ests , which minister un@@ to the Lord , are the sons of Aaron , and the L@@ evi@@ tes wait upon their business :
and , be@@ hold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his pri@@ ests with so@@ unding tr@@ ump@@ ets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the Lord God of your fa@@ thers ; for ye shall not prosp@@ er .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it came to pass , that God smo@@ te Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
and A@@ SA and the people that were with him pursu@@ ed them un@@ to Ger@@ ar : and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians were over@@ thrown , that they could not rec@@ over themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much sp@@ oil .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great v@@ ex@@ ations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
and all Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the Lord gave them rest round about .
and also concerning Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ h the mother of A@@ SA the king , he removed her from being qu@@ een , because she had made an i@@ dol in a gro@@ ve : and A@@ SA cut down her i@@ dol , and st@@ amp@@ ed it , and bur@@ n@@ t it at the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
in the six and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of A@@ SA Ba@@ as@@ ha king of Israel came up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and built Ram@@ ah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
then A@@ SA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben @@@ -@@ @ h@@ ad@@ ad king of Syria , that d@@ wel@@ t at Dam@@ as@@ cus , saying ,
and at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and said un@@ to him , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast reli@@ ed on the king of Syria , and not reli@@ ed on the Lord TH@@ Y God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of th@@ ine hand .
for the eyes of the Lord run to and f@@ ro throughout the whole ear@@ th , to she@@ w himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . her@@ e@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly : therefore from hen@@ ce@@ forth th@@ ou s@@ halt have wars .
then A@@ SA was wro@@ th with the se@@ er , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a ra@@ ge with him because of this thing . and A@@ SA op@@ pressed some of the people the same time .
and A@@ SA in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was dis@@ eased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physi@@ cians .
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his pr@@ inces , even to Ben @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ il , and to Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and to N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and to Micha@@ i@@ ah , to te@@ ach in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught the people .
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fa@@ thers : of Ju@@ da@@ h , the cap@@ tains of thousands ; Ad@@ n@@ ah the chief , and with him m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our three hundred thousand .
and after certain years he went down to A@@ ha@@ b to Samar@@ ia . and A@@ ha@@ b killed she@@ ep and ox@@ en for him in ab@@ und@@ ance , and for the people that he had with him , and persu@@ aded him to go up with him to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ gil@@ e@@ ad .
and the king of Israel and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h sat either of them on his th@@ r@@ one , clo@@ th@@ ed in their rob@@ es , and they sat in a vo@@ id place at the entering in of the gate of Samar@@ ia ; and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied before them .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they comp@@ ass@@ ed about him to fight : but J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cri@@ ed out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to de@@ part from him .
for it came to pass , that , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bo@@ w at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the join@@ ts of the har@@ ness : therefore he said to his char@@ i@@ ot man , Tur@@ n th@@ ine hand , that th@@ ou may@@ est carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : ho@@ w@@ be@@ it the king of Israel stayed himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
moreover in Jer@@ usalem did J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at set of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and of the pri@@ ests , and of the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , for the judgment of the Lord , and for controversi@@ es , when they returned to Jer@@ usalem .
it came to pass after this also , that the children of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon , and with them other bes@@ ide the Am@@ mon@@ ites , came against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at to battle .
then upon Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , a Lev@@ ite of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , came the Spiri@@ t of the Lord in the mid@@ st of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
to mor@@ row go ye down against them : be@@ hold , they come up by the c@@ lif@@ f of Z@@ iz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Bro@@ ok , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , and of the children of the Kor@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a l@@ oud voice on high .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ a@@ b stood up against the inhabitants of mount Se@@ ir , ut@@ ter@@ ly to s@@ lay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , every one helped to destroy another .
and on the fourth day they assemb@@ led themselves in the val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h ; for there they b@@ les@@ sed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ha@@ h , un@@ to this day .
then they returned , every man of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in the fo@@ ref@@ ront of them , to go again to Jer@@ usalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to re@@ jo@@ ice over their enem@@ ies .
and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ ig@@ ned over Ju@@ da@@ h : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty and five years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of J@@ eh@@ u the son of Han@@ ani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up to the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , he strengthened himself , and sle@@ w all his bre@@ th@@ ren with the s@@ word , and di@@ vers also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b : for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b to wife : and he w@@ rought that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it the Lord would not destroy the house of David , because of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
and there came a writing to him from Eli@@ j@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of David TH@@ Y father , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast not walked in the ways of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at TH@@ Y father , nor in the ways of A@@ SA king of Ju@@ da@@ h ,
and they came up into Ju@@ da@@ h , and br@@ ake into it , and carried away all the sub@@ stance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wi@@ ves ; so that there was never a son left him , save Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the youngest of his sons .
and he returned to be he@@ aled in J@@ ez@@ reel because of the wounds which were given him at Ram@@ ah , when he fought with Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria . and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am king of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to see J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b at J@@ ez@@ reel , because he was si@@ ck .
and it came to pass , that , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment upon the house of A@@ ha@@ b , and found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the bre@@ th@@ ren of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , that minist@@ ered to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , he sle@@ w them .
and in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada strengthened himself , and took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Ob@@ ed , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , and E@@ lis@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , into C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him .
and they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , of the pri@@ ests and of the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be por@@ ters of the doors ;
and a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
but let none come into the house of the Lord , save the pri@@ ests , and they that minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes ; they shall go in , for they are hol@@ y : but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall comp@@ ass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever else co@@ me@@ th into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he co@@ me@@ th in , and when he go@@ eth out .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes and all Ju@@ da@@ h did according to all things that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est had comman@@ ded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath , with them that were to go out on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath : for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est dismissed not the courses .
moreover Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temp@@ le to the left side of the temp@@ le , along by the alt@@ ar and the temp@@ le , by the king round about .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the hor@@ se gate by the king 's house , they sle@@ w her there .
then all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and br@@ ake it down , and br@@ ake his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and sle@@ w Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
and he took the cap@@ tains of hundreds , and the no@@ bles , and the govern@@ ors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the th@@ r@@ one of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
for the sons of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , that w@@ ic@@ ked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bes@@ to@@ w upon Ba@@ al@@ im .
and the king and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired mas@@ ons and car@@ pen@@ ters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as w@@ rought iron and br@@ ass to mend the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and destroyed all the pr@@ inces of the people from among the people , and sent all the sp@@ oil of them un@@ to the king of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
now it came to pass , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he sle@@ w his servants that had killed the king his father .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , to w@@ it , the army that was come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : where@@ fore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in great an@@ ger .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away cap@@ tive , and brought them un@@ to the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
now it came to pass , after that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was come from the sla@@ ughter of the E@@ dom@@ ites , that he brought the go@@ ds of the children of Se@@ ir , and set them up to be his go@@ ds , and bo@@ wed down himself before them , and burned incen@@ se un@@ to them .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the an@@ ger of the Lord was kin@@ d@@ led against A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , and he sent un@@ to him a pro@@ phe@@ t , which said un@@ to him , Wh@@ y h@@ ast th@@ ou sought after the go@@ ds of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of th@@ ine hand ?
T@@ ho@@ u say@@ est , L@@ o , th@@ ou h@@ ast s@@ mit@@ ten the E@@ dom@@ ites ; and th@@ ine heart lif@@ te@@ th the@@ e up to bo@@ ast : abide now at home ; why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou med@@ dle to th@@ ine hurt , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest fall , even th@@ ou , and Ju@@ da@@ h with the@@ e ?
so Jo@@ ash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , which belon@@ get@@ h to Ju@@ da@@ h .
and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel took A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , the son of Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , at Beth @@@ -@@ @ she@@ mes@@ h , and brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and br@@ ake down the wall of Jer@@ usalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the cor@@ ner gate , four hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the host@@ ages also , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
now after the time that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah did turn away from following the Lord they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem ; and he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish : but they sent to L@@ ach@@ ish after him , and sle@@ w him there .
and he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and br@@ ake down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d , and built cities about Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per un@@ to the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , jud@@ ging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him with his fa@@ thers in the field of the bur@@ ial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a le@@ per : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and the children of Israel carried away cap@@ tive of their bre@@ th@@ ren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and took also away much sp@@ oil from them , and brought the sp@@ oil to Samar@@ ia .
then certain of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , and Je@@ hiz@@ ki@@ ah the son of S@@ hal@@ lum , and A@@ masa the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against them that came from the war ,
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it un@@ to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but he helped him not .
and A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him al@@ tar@@ s in every cor@@ ner of Jer@@ usalem .
and A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem : but they brought him not into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he re@@ ig@@ ned nine and twenty years in Jer@@ usalem . and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and rep@@ aired them .
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
then the L@@ evi@@ tes ar@@ ose , Mah@@ ath the son of A@@ mas@@ ai , and Jo@@ el the son of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : and of the sons of Mer@@ ari , K@@ ish the son of Ab@@ di , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hal@@ ele@@ l : and of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites ; Jo@@ ah the son of Z@@ im@@ ma@@ h , and E@@ den the son of Jo@@ ah :
and the pri@@ ests went into the in@@ ner part of the house of the Lord , to cleans@@ e it , and brought out all the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess that they found in the temp@@ le of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . and the L@@ evi@@ tes took it , to carry it out abroad into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanc@@ ti@@ fy , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the por@@ ch of the Lord : so they sanc@@ ti@@ fied the house of the Lord in eight days ; and in the six@@ teen@@ th day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king , and said , We have cleans@@ ed all the house of the Lord , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , with all the vessels there@@ of , and the she@@ w@@ bread table , with all the vessels there@@ of .
so they killed the bul@@ loc@@ ks , and the pri@@ ests received the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the alt@@ ar : likewise , when they had killed the r@@ ams , they sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar : they killed also the lam@@ bs , and they sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood upon the alt@@ ar .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah comman@@ ded to offer the bur@@ n@@ t offering upon the alt@@ ar . and when the bur@@ n@@ t offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the tr@@ ump@@ ets , and with the instruments or@@ da@@ ined by David king of Israel .
moreover H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king and the pr@@ inces comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes to sing praise un@@ to the Lord with the words of David , and of A@@ sap@@ h the se@@ er . and they san@@ g pra@@ ises with gla@@ d@@ ness , and they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ pped .
now be ye not sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked , as your fa@@ thers were , but yield yo@@ ur@@ selves un@@ to the Lord , and enter into his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which he hat@@ h sanc@@ ti@@ fied for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath may turn away from you .
and they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they killed the pass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month : and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were as@@ ha@@ med , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and brought in the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings into the house of the Lord .
for there were many in the Con@@ gre@@ gation that were not sanc@@ ti@@ fied : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes had the charge of the killing of the pass@@ overs for every one that was not clean , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them un@@ to the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jer@@ usalem kept the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread seven days with great gla@@ d@@ ness : and the L@@ evi@@ tes and the pri@@ ests praised the Lord day by day , singing with l@@ oud instruments un@@ to the Lord .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation that came out of Israel , and the st@@ ran@@ gers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his sub@@ stance for the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , to w@@ it , for the morning and evening bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings for the sa@@ b@@ ba@@ ths , and for the new mo@@ ons , and for the set fe@@ asts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
and concerning the children of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h , that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , they also brought in the ti@@ the of ox@@ en and she@@ ep , and the ti@@ the of hol@@ y things which were consec@@ rated un@@ to the Lord their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
and he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and sp@@ ake comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
after this did Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a send his servants to Jer@@ usalem , ( but he himself laid siege against L@@ ach@@ ish , and all his power with him , ) un@@ to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and un@@ to all Ju@@ da@@ h that were at Jer@@ usalem , saying ,
know ye not what I and my fa@@ thers have done un@@ to all the people of other lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations that my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' speech un@@ to the people of Jer@@ usalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had exceeding much ri@@ ches and honour : and he made himself treas@@ ur@@ ies for silver , and for gold , and for pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and for sp@@ ices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all manner of pleas@@ ant je@@ wel@@ s ;
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it in the business of the ambassadors of the pr@@ inces of Bab@@ yl@@ on , who sent un@@ to him to inqu@@ ire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his Go@@ od@@ ness , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , and in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the chi@@ ef@@ est of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the sons of David : and all Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem did him honour at his death . and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
but did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , like un@@ to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m : also he observed times , and used en@@ chan@@ tments , and used wit@@ ch@@ craft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with w@@ iz@@ ards : he w@@ rought much ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , to prov@@ oke him to an@@ ger .
and he took away the st@@ range go@@ ds , and the i@@ dol out of the house of the Lord , and all the al@@ tar@@ s that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jer@@ usalem , and cast them out of the city .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and his pray@@ er un@@ to his God , and the words of the se@@ ers that sp@@ ake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
but he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of the Lord , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father : for Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to all the car@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them ;
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
now in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of his reign , when he had p@@ urged the land , and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the rec@@ order , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the over@@ sight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the work@@ men that w@@ rought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est found a book of the law of the Lord given by Mos@@ es .
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the over@@ se@@ ers , and to the hand of the work@@ men .
and the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah a ser@@ vant of the king 's , saying ,
and H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and they that the king had appointed , went to H@@ ul@@ da@@ h the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the wife of S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Ti@@ k@@ vat@@ h , the son of Has@@ ra@@ h , keep@@ er of the war@@ dro@@ be ; ( now she d@@ wel@@ t in Jer@@ usalem in the colle@@ ge : ) and they sp@@ ake to her to that effect .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon this place , and upon the inhabitants there@@ of , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h :
because they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they might prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wr@@ ath shall be p@@ oured out upon this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
and as for the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , so shall ye say un@@ to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which th@@ ou h@@ ast heard ;
and prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves by the houses of your fa@@ thers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the families of the fa@@ thers of your bre@@ th@@ ren the people , and after the division of the families of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
and Jos@@ i@@ ah gave to the people , of the flock , lam@@ bs and kids , all for the pass@@ over offer@@ ings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bul@@ loc@@ ks : these were of the king 's sub@@ stance .
and they removed the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer un@@ to the Lord , as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es . and so did they with the ox@@ en .
and they ro@@ asted the pass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other hol@@ y offer@@ ings so@@ d they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ edil@@ y among all the people .
his servants therefore took him out of that char@@ i@@ ot , and put him in the second char@@ i@@ ot that he had ; and they brought him to Jer@@ usalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of his fa@@ thers . and all Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem mour@@ ned for Jos@@ i@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ omin@@ ations which he did , and that which was found in him , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and when the year was expired , king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sent , and brought him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the good@@ ly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
and the Lord God of their fa@@ thers sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up be@@ times , and sending ; because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his pr@@ inces ; all these he brought to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be accomplished , the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that the word of the Lord by the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah might be fulfilled , the Lord s@@ tir@@ red up the spirit of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , that he made a proc@@ lamation throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jer@@ usalem , which is in Ju@@ da@@ h , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel , ( he is the God , ) which is in Jer@@ usalem .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with be@@ asts , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , bes@@ ide all that was will@@ ingly offered .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and came again un@@ to Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
and these were they which went up from Tel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ lah , Tel @@@ -@@ @ har@@ sa , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ dan , and Im@@ mer : but they could not she@@ w their father 's house , and their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel :
and of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i ; which took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name :
and some of the chief of the fa@@ thers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jer@@ usalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
and they set the alt@@ ar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on un@@ to the Lord , even bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings morning and evening .
and after@@ ward offered the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , both of the new mo@@ ons , and of all the set fe@@ asts of the Lord that were consec@@ rated , and of every one that will@@ ingly offered a fre@@ e@@ will offering un@@ to the Lord .
then stood J@@ es@@ hua with his sons and his bre@@ th@@ ren , Kad@@ mi@@ el and his sons , the sons of Ju@@ da@@ h , together , to set forward the work@@ men in the house of God : the sons of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , with their sons and their bre@@ th@@ ren the L@@ evi@@ tes .
but many of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes and chief of the fa@@ thers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a l@@ oud voice ; and many sh@@ ou@@ ted al@@ oud for joy :
so that the people could not dis@@ cer@@ n the no@@ ise of the sh@@ out of joy from the no@@ ise of the we@@ eping of the people : for the people sh@@ ou@@ ted with a l@@ oud sh@@ out , and the no@@ ise was heard af@@ ar off .
and in the days of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es wrote B@@ ish@@ lam , Mi@@ th@@ red@@ ath , T@@ ab@@ e@@ el , and the rest of their compan@@ ions , un@@ to Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Per@@ sia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian ton@@ gue , and interpreted in the Syrian ton@@ gue .
then wrote Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and the rest of their compan@@ ions ; the Din@@ ai@@ tes , the Ap@@ har@@ sa@@ th@@ chi@@ tes , the Tar@@ p@@ eli@@ tes , the Ap@@ har@@ sites , the Arch@@ evi@@ tes , the Bab@@ y@@ lon@@ ians , the Sus@@ an@@ chi@@ tes , the De@@ ha@@ vi@@ tes , and the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and no@@ ble As@@ n@@ app@@ ar brought over , and set in the cities of Samar@@ ia , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known now un@@ to the king , that , if this city be buil@@ ded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tri@@ bute , and cust@@ om , and so th@@ ou s@@ halt end@@ am@@ age the revenue of the kings .
then sent the king an answer un@@ to Re@@ h@@ um the chan@@ cellor , and to Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and to the rest of their compan@@ ions that d@@ well in Samar@@ ia , and un@@ to the rest beyond the river , Peace , and at such a time .
and I comman@@ ded , and search hat@@ h been made , and it is found that this city of old time hat@@ h made insur@@ rec@@ tion against kings , and that rebel@@ lion and se@@ di@@ tion have been made there@@ in .
now when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went up in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
then the pro@@ ph@@ ets , Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of I@@ d@@ do , pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied un@@ to the Jews that were in Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in the name of the God of Israel , even un@@ to them .
but the eye of their God was upon the el@@ ders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to ce@@ ase , ti@@ ll the matter came to Dar@@ i@@ us : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the cop@@ y of the letter that Tat@@ na@@ i , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ boz@@ na@@ i , and his compan@@ ions the Ap@@ har@@ s@@ achi@@ tes , which were on this side the river , sent un@@ to Dar@@ i@@ us the king :
but after that our fa@@ thers had provoked the God of heav@@ en un@@ to wr@@ ath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , the Chal@@ de@@ an , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar took out of the temp@@ le that was in Jer@@ usalem , and brought them into the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , those did Cy@@ ru@@ s the king take out of the temp@@ le of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and they were delivered un@@ to one , whose name was Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , whom he had made governor ;
then came the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now hat@@ h it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
then Dar@@ i@@ us the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rol@@ ls , where the treasures were laid up in Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and there was found at A@@ ch@@ meth@@ a , in the palace that is in the province of the Me@@ des , a rol@@ l , and there@@ in was a record thus written :
and they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves un@@ to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the he@@ a@@ then of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , un@@ to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
now this is the cop@@ y of the letter that the king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es gave un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be , even a s@@ cri@@ be of the words of the comman@@ d@@ ments of the Lord , and of his stat@@ utes to Israel .
Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es , king of kings , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , a s@@ cri@@ be of the law of the God of heav@@ en , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , which are min@@ ded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jer@@ usalem , go with the@@ e .
and all the silver and gold that th@@ ou can@@ st find in all the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the pri@@ ests , offering will@@ ingly for the house of their God which is in Jer@@ usalem :
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall seem good to the@@ e , and to TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever more shall be ne@@ ed@@ ful for the house of TH@@ Y God , which th@@ ou s@@ halt have occasion to bes@@ to@@ w , bes@@ to@@ w it out of the king 's treasure house .
wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be dil@@ ig@@ ently done for the house of the God of heav@@ en : for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
also we certi@@ fy you , that tou@@ ching any of the pri@@ ests and L@@ evi@@ tes , singers , por@@ ters , N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be law@@ ful to impose toll , tri@@ bute , or cust@@ om , upon them .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever will not do the law of TH@@ Y God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed spe@@ edil@@ y upon him , whether it be un@@ to death , or to ban@@ is@@ hment , or to confis@@ cation of goods , or to imprisonment .
b@@ les@@ sed be the Lord God of our fa@@ thers , which hat@@ h put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to be@@ auti@@ fy the house of the Lord which is in Jer@@ usalem :
and I gathered them together to the river that run@@ net@@ h to A@@ hava ; and there abo@@ de we in ten@@ ts three days : and I viewed the people , and the pri@@ ests , and found there none of the sons of L@@ evi .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Jar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and for Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , men of understanding .
and weighed un@@ to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his coun@@ sel@@ lers , and his lor@@ ds , and all Israel there present , had offered :
watch ye , and keep them , until ye we@@ igh them before the chief of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and chief of the fa@@ thers of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the ch@@ ambers of the house of the Lord .
so took the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to the house of our God .
for they have taken of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the hol@@ y se@@ ed have min@@ g@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the pr@@ inces and rul@@ ers hat@@ h been chief in this t@@ res@@ pass .
then were assemb@@ led un@@ to me every one that tre@@ m@@ b@@ led at the words of the God of Israel , because of the trans@@ gres@@ sion of those that had been carried away ; and I sat ast@@ on@@ ied until the evening sacrifice .
and at the evening sacrifice I ar@@ ose up from my heav@@ iness ; and having rent my gar@@ ment and my man@@ tle , I fell upon my k@@ ne@@ es , and spread out my hands un@@ to the Lord my God .
and Sh@@ ec@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of E@@ lam , answ@@ ered and said un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra , We have t@@ res@@ passed against our God , and have taken st@@ range wi@@ ves of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
and that wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever would not come within three days , according to the coun@@ sel of the pr@@ inces and the el@@ ders , all his sub@@ stance should be for@@ fe@@ ited , and himself separated from the Con@@ gre@@ gation of those that had been carried away .
and among the sons of the pri@@ ests there were found that had taken st@@ range wi@@ ves : name@@ ly , of the sons of J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and his bre@@ th@@ ren ; Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and Jar@@ i@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
that Han@@ ani , one of my bre@@ th@@ ren , came , he and certain men of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days , and fas@@ ted , and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
but if ye turn un@@ to me , and keep my comman@@ d@@ ments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the heav@@ en , yet will I gather them from th@@ ence , and will bring them un@@ to the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
and it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine , and gave it un@@ to the king . now I had not been be@@ fore@@ time sad in his presence .
and said un@@ to the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my coun@@ tenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fa@@ thers ' se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , li@@ eth waste , and the gates there@@ of are consu@@ med with fire ?
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and I ar@@ ose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jer@@ usalem : neither was there any be@@ ast with me , save the be@@ ast that I ro@@ de upon .
and the rul@@ ers knew not w@@ hi@@ ther I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the pri@@ ests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rul@@ ers , nor to the rest that did the work .
but when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , and G@@ es@@ hem the Ara@@ bi@@ an , heard it , they la@@ ug@@ hed us to scor@@ n , and desp@@ ised us , and said , What is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est rose up with his bre@@ th@@ ren the pri@@ ests , and they buil@@ ded the she@@ ep gate ; they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , and set up the doors of it ; even un@@ to the to@@ wer of Me@@ ah they sanc@@ ti@@ fied it , un@@ to the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el .
but the fish gate did the sons of H@@ ass@@ en@@ a@@ ah build , who also laid the be@@ ams there@@ of , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah , the son of Ko@@ z . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ e@@ el . and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Zad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana .
moreover the old gate rep@@ aired Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah , and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah ; they laid the be@@ ams there@@ of , and set up the doors there@@ of , and the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
and next un@@ to them rep@@ aired Me@@ la@@ ti@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , and Jad@@ on the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite , the men of Gi@@ be@@ on , and of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , un@@ to the th@@ r@@ one of the governor on this side the river .
the val@@ ley gate rep@@ aired Han@@ un , and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah ; they built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of , and a thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts on the wall un@@ to the D@@ ung gate .
but the D@@ ung gate rep@@ aired Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of part of Beth @@@ -@@ @ h@@ acc@@ er@@ em ; he built it , and set up the doors there@@ of , the loc@@ ks there@@ of , and the bars there@@ of .
after him rep@@ aired Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ bu@@ k , the ru@@ ler of the half part of Beth @@@ -@@ @ z@@ ur , un@@ to the place over against the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of David , and to the pool that was made , and un@@ to the house of the m@@ igh@@ ty .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the to@@ wer which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah the son of Par@@ os@@ h .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat heard that we buil@@ ded the wall , he was wro@@ th , and took great in@@ dign@@ ation , and mo@@ cked the Jews .
and cover not their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and let not their sin be blo@@ t@@ ted out from before the@@ e : for they have provoked the@@ e to an@@ ger before the buil@@ ders .
but it came to pass , that when San@@ bal@@ lat , and To@@ bi@@ ah , and the Ara@@ bi@@ ans , and the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ di@@ tes , heard that the walls of Jer@@ usalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wro@@ th ,
and it came to pass , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known un@@ to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one un@@ to his work .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants w@@ rought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spe@@ ars , the shi@@ elds , and the bo@@ ws , and the haber@@ ge@@ ons ; and the rul@@ ers were behind all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
they which buil@@ ded on the wall , and they that b@@ are bur@@ den@@ s , with those that la@@ ded , every one with one of his hands w@@ rought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the buil@@ ders , every one had his s@@ word gir@@ ded by his side , and so buil@@ ded . and he that so@@ unded the tr@@ ump@@ et was by me .
so neither I , nor my bre@@ th@@ ren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clo@@ th@@ es , saving that every one put them off for w@@ ashing .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fif@@ ty of the Jews and rul@@ ers , bes@@ ide those that came un@@ to us from among the he@@ a@@ then that are about us .
and th@@ ou h@@ ast also appointed pro@@ ph@@ ets to pre@@ ach of the@@ e at Jer@@ usalem , saying , There is a king in Ju@@ da@@ h : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take coun@@ sel together .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an ev@@ il report , that they might re@@ pro@@ ach me .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the cap@@ tivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away , and came again to Jer@@ usalem and to Ju@@ da@@ h , every one un@@ to his city ;
the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , an hundred thirty and eight .
and of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , which took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te to wife , and was called after their name .
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the por@@ ters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ ims , and all Israel , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their cities .
also J@@ es@@ hua , and Ban@@ i , and S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , J@@ amin , Ak@@ ku@@ b , Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai , Ho@@ dij@@ ah , Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , Kel@@ ita , A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , Joz@@ ab@@ ad , H@@ anan , Pe@@ la@@ i@@ ah , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stood in their place .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fa@@ thers of all the people , the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , un@@ to E@@ z@@ ra the s@@ cri@@ be , even to understand the words of the law .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves bo@@ o@@ ths , every one upon the ro@@ of of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of them that were come again out of the cap@@ tivity made bo@@ o@@ ths , and sat under the bo@@ o@@ ths : for since the days of J@@ es@@ hua the son of nun un@@ to that day had not the children of Israel done so . and there was very great gla@@ d@@ ness .
also day by day , from the first day un@@ to the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . and they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a so@@ lem@@ n assembly , according un@@ to the manner .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they conf@@ essed , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the Lord their God .
and she@@ w@@ ed@@ st signs and won@@ ders upon P@@ har@@ o@@ ah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for th@@ ou k@@ newest that they dealt pro@@ u@@ dly against them . so di@@ d@@ st th@@ ou get the@@ e a name , as it is this day .
and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st divide the sea before them , so that they went through the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry land ; and their persec@@ ut@@ ors th@@ ou thre@@ west into the deep@@ s , as a stone into the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
moreover th@@ ou led@@ dest them in the day by a cl@@ ou@@ dy pil@@ lar ; and in the night by a pil@@ lar of fire , to give them light in the way where@@ in they should go .
and g@@ av@@ est them bread from heav@@ en for their hunger , and b@@ rough@@ test forth water for them out of the rock for their thir@@ st , and promis@@ ed@@ st them that they should go in to poss@@ ess the land which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st sworn to give them .
yet th@@ ou in TH@@ Y manif@@ old mer@@ cies for@@ so@@ ok@@ est them not in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : the pil@@ lar of the cl@@ oud depar@@ ted not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pil@@ lar of fire by night , to she@@ w them light , and the way where@@ in they should go .
moreover th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms and nations , and di@@ d@@ st divide them into cor@@ ners : so they poss@@ essed the land of S@@ ih@@ on , and the land of the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an .
their children also multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed@@ st th@@ ou as the stars of heav@@ en , and b@@ rough@@ test them into the land , concerning which th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st promised to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept TH@@ Y law , nor hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y comman@@ d@@ ments and TH@@ Y testimon@@ ies , where@@ with th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st testify against them .
for they have not served the@@ e in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in TH@@ Y great Go@@ od@@ ness that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est them , and in the large and f@@ at land which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est before them , neither turned they from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
be@@ hold , we are servants this day , and for the land that th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est un@@ to our fa@@ thers to eat the fruit there@@ of and the good there@@ of , be@@ hold , we are servants in it :
and it yi@@ el@@ de@@ th much increase un@@ to the kings whom th@@ ou h@@ ast set over us because of our sin@@ s : also they have domin@@ ion over our bodies , and over our c@@ attle , at their pleas@@ ure , and we are in great dist@@ ress .
also the fir@@ st@@ born of our sons , and of our c@@ attle , as it is written in the law , and the fir@@ st@@ lings of our her@@ ds and of our f@@ loc@@ ks , to bring to the house of our God , un@@ to the pri@@ ests that minister in the house of our God :
and the pri@@ est the son of Aaron shall be with the L@@ evi@@ tes , when the L@@ evi@@ tes take ti@@ th@@ es : and the L@@ evi@@ tes shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ th@@ es un@@ to the house of our God , to the ch@@ ambers , into the treasure house .
and at Jer@@ usalem d@@ wel@@ t certain of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h ; Ath@@ ai@@ ah the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ hal@@ al@@ e@@ el , of the children of Per@@ ez ;
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Co@@ l @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sh@@ il@@ oni .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sal@@ lu the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Jo@@ ed , the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , the son of K@@ ola@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah , the son of I@@ th@@ i@@ el , the son of J@@ es@@ ai@@ ah .
Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Zad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , was the ru@@ ler of the house of God .
and their bre@@ th@@ ren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and A@@ dai@@ ah the son of Jer@@ o@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah ,
and his bre@@ th@@ ren , chief of the fa@@ thers , two hundred for@@ ty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of Mes@@ hil@@ le@@ mo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their bre@@ th@@ ren , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ our , an hundred twenty and eight : and their over@@ se@@ er was Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el , the son of one of the great men .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h d@@ wel@@ t at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , and in the villages there@@ of , and at Di@@ bon , and in the villages there@@ of , and at J@@ ek@@ ab@@ z@@ e@@ el , and in the villages there@@ of ,
the sons of L@@ evi , the chief of the fa@@ thers , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
and the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Has@@ habi@@ ah , S@@ her@@ e@@ bi@@ ah , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Kad@@ mi@@ el , with their bre@@ th@@ ren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
then I brought up the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , where@@ of one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the D@@ ung gate :
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets ; name@@ ly , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Micha@@ i@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h :
and at the fo@@ un@@ tain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even un@@ to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
and from above the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the to@@ wer of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el , and the to@@ wer of Me@@ ah , even un@@ to the she@@ ep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ abi@@ te should not come into the Con@@ gre@@ gation of God for ever ;
and I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them : for the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wi@@ pe not out my good de@@ eds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices there@@ of .
there d@@ wel@@ t men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , which brought fish , and all manner of w@@ are , and sold on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath un@@ to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
then I testified against them , and said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y lo@@ dge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath .
and I conten@@ ded with them , and Cur@@ sed them , and smo@@ te certain of them , and p@@ lu@@ cked off their ha@@ ir , and made them swe@@ ar by God , saying , Y@@ e shall not give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to their sons , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters un@@ to your sons , or for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
now it came to pass in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us which re@@ ig@@ ned , from India even un@@ to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast un@@ to all the people that were present in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace , both un@@ to great and small , seven days , in the court of the gar@@ den of the king 's palace ;
and the drinking was according to the law ; none did comp@@ el : for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleas@@ ure .
for this de@@ ed of the qu@@ een shall come abroad un@@ to all women , so that they shall desp@@ ise their hus@@ bands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us comman@@ ded V@@ ash@@ ti the qu@@ een to be brought in before him , but she came not .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his emp@@ ire , ( for it is great , ) all the wi@@ ves shall give to their hus@@ bands honour , both to great and small .
then thus came every ma@@ iden un@@ to the king ; wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever she desi@@ red was given her to go with her out of the house of the women un@@ to the king 's house .
and the king lov@@ ed Es@@ ther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the vir@@ g@@ ins ; so that he set the royal cro@@ wn upon her head , and made her qu@@ een instead of V@@ ash@@ ti .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , of those which kept the door , were wro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and when In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bo@@ wed , and rever@@ enced Ham@@ an : for the king had so comman@@ ded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai bo@@ wed not , nor did him rever@@ ence .
and he thought scor@@ n to lay hands on Mor@@ dec@@ ai alone ; for they had she@@ wed him the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai : where@@ fore Ham@@ an sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole k@@ ing@@ dom of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , even the people of Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
if it ple@@ ase the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand tal@@ ents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king 's treas@@ ur@@ ies .
when Mor@@ dec@@ ai perceived all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th with ashes , and went out into the mid@@ st of the city , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud and a bitter cry ;
so Es@@ ther 's ma@@ ids and her ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins came and told it her . then was the qu@@ een exce@@ ed@@ ingly gri@@ ev@@ ed ; and she sent ra@@ im@@ ent to clo@@ the Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and to take away his s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th from him : but he received it not .
then called Es@@ ther for Hat@@ ach , one of the king 's ch@@ am@@ ber@@ la@@ ins , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a comman@@ d@@ ment to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to know what it was , and why it was .
now it came to pass on the third day , that Es@@ ther put on her royal appar@@ el , and stood in the in@@ ner court of the king 's house , over against the king 's house : and the king sat upon his royal th@@ r@@ one in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
and it was so , when the king saw Es@@ ther the qu@@ een standing in the court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to Es@@ ther the golden scep@@ tre that was in his hand . so Es@@ ther drew near , and touched the top of the scep@@ tre .
then went Ham@@ an forth that day jo@@ y@@ ful and with a glad heart : but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of in@@ dign@@ ation against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
and Ham@@ an told them of the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , and the multi@@ tude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night could not the king sle@@ ep , and he comman@@ ded to bring the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les ; and they were read before the king .
and the king said again un@@ to Es@@ ther on the second day at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , What is TH@@ Y petition , qu@@ een Es@@ ther ? and it shall be granted the@@ e : and what is TH@@ Y request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered and said , If I have found favour in TH@@ Y sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and Es@@ ther sp@@ ake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him with te@@ ars to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had dev@@ ised against the Jews .
and all the rul@@ ers of the provinces , and the li@@ e@@ uten@@ ants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mor@@ dec@@ ai fell upon them .
and Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , and Dal@@ ph@@ on , and A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
for the Jews that were in Sh@@ us@@ han gathered themselves together on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and sle@@ w three hundred men at Sh@@ us@@ han ; but on the pre@@ y they laid not their hand .
but the other Jews that were in the king 's provinces gathered themselves together , and stood for their lives , and had rest from their enem@@ ies , and sle@@ w of their fo@@ es sev@@ enty and five thousand , but they laid not their hands on the pre@@ y ,
therefore the Jews of the villages , that d@@ wel@@ t in the un@@ wal@@ led towns , made the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gla@@ d@@ ness and fe@@ asting , and a good day , and of sending por@@ tions one to another .
because Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ me@@ da@@ th@@ a , the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , the enemy of all the Jews , had dev@@ ised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast PUR , that is , the lot , to consum@@ e them , and to destroy them ;
but when Es@@ ther came before the king , he comman@@ ded by letters that his w@@ ic@@ ked device , which he dev@@ ised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be han@@ ged on the gal@@ lows .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the gre@@ at@@ ness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , where@@ un@@ to the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Media and Per@@ sia ?
his sub@@ stance also was seven thousand she@@ ep , and three thousand ca@@ me@@ ls , and five hundred yok@@ e of ox@@ en , and five hundred she ass@@ es , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
and when they lifted up their eyes af@@ ar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt ; and they rent every one his man@@ tle , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led d@@ ust upon their heads toward heav@@ en .
as for that night , let d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize upon it ; let it not be joined un@@ to the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of the tw@@ il@@ ight there@@ of be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the da@@ w@@ ning of the day :
for the thing which I greatly fear@@ ed is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come un@@ to me .
for th@@ ou s@@ halt be in league with the stones of the field : and the be@@ asts of the field shall be at peace with the@@ e .
then should I yet have comfor@@ t ; ye@@ a , I would har@@ den myself in sor@@ row : let him not spar@@ e ; for I have not conce@@ aled the words of the Holy One .
and why dost th@@ ou not par@@ don my trans@@ gres@@ sion , and take away mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I sle@@ ep in the d@@ ust ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
if I be w@@ ic@@ ked , wo@@ e un@@ to me ; and if I be righ@@ te@@ ous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of conf@@ usion ; therefore see th@@ ou mine aff@@ li@@ ction ;
he that is ready to sli@@ p with his feet is as a lam@@ p desp@@ ised in the thought of him that is at ease .
be@@ hold , he break@@ eth down , and it can@@ not be built again : he shut@@ te@@ th up a man , and there can be no opening .
T@@ ho@@ u p@@ ut@@ test my feet also in the sto@@ cks , and lo@@ ok@@ est narro@@ w@@ ly un@@ to all my p@@ aths ; th@@ ou set@@ test a print upon the he@@ els of my feet .
I was at ease , but he hat@@ h broken me as@@ under : he hat@@ h also taken me by my nec@@ k , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
that which he la@@ b@@ oured for shall he restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down : according to his sub@@ stance shall the restitution be , and he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice there@@ in .
when he is about to fill his bel@@ ly , God shall cast the fur@@ y of his wr@@ ath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is e@@ ating .
on the left hand , where he do@@ th work , but I can@@ not be@@ hold him : he hi@@ de@@ th himself on the right hand , that I can@@ not see him :
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terr@@ ors of the shadow of death .
then was kin@@ d@@ led the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Buz@@ ite , of the kin@@ d@@ red of R@@ am : against Jo@@ b was his wr@@ ath kin@@ d@@ led , because he justified himself rather than God .
let me not , I pra@@ y you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give f@@ lat@@ tering titles un@@ to man .
he withdra@@ w@@ eth not his eyes from the righ@@ te@@ ous : but with kings are they on the th@@ r@@ one ; ye@@ a , he do@@ th establish them for ever , and they are ex@@ al@@ ted .
even so would he have removed the@@ e out of the stra@@ it into a broad place , where there is no stra@@ it@@ ness ; and that which should be set on TH@@ Y table should be full of fat@@ ness .
and it is turned round about by his coun@@ sels : that they may do wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he comman@@ de@@ th them upon the face of the world in the ear@@ th .
and it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words un@@ to Jo@@ b , the Lord said to Eli@@ p@@ haz the Tem@@ an@@ ite , My wr@@ ath is kin@@ d@@ led against the@@ e , and against TH@@ Y two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my ser@@ vant Jo@@ b hat@@ h .
and he shall be like a tree plan@@ ted by the rivers of water , that br@@ ing@@ eth forth his fruit in his season ; his le@@ af also shall not wi@@ ther ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he do@@ eth shall prosp@@ er .
but as for me , I will come into TH@@ Y house in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy : and in TH@@ Y fear will I worship toward TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
but let all those that put their trust in the@@ e re@@ jo@@ ice : let them ever sh@@ out for joy , because th@@ ou defen@@ dest them : let them also that love TH@@ Y name be jo@@ y@@ ful in the@@ e .
if I have re@@ warded ev@@ il un@@ to him that was at peace with me ; ( ye@@ a , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
he li@@ eth in wait secre@@ tly as a lion in his den : he li@@ eth in wait to catch the poor : he do@@ th catch the poor , when he dra@@ w@@ eth him into his net .
She@@ w TH@@ Y mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness , O th@@ ou that sav@@ est by TH@@ Y right hand them which put their trust in the@@ e from those that rise up against them .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliver@@ er ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my bu@@ ck@@ ler , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , and my high to@@ wer .
in my dist@@ ress I called upon the Lord , and cri@@ ed un@@ to my God : he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le , and my cry came before him , even into his e@@ ars .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of the people ; and th@@ ou h@@ ast made me the head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
he deliver@@ eth me from mine enem@@ ies : ye@@ a , th@@ ou lif@@ test me up above those that rise up against me : th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered me from the violent man .
his going forth is from the end of the heav@@ en , and his cir@@ cu@@ it un@@ to the ends of it : and there is nothing hi@@ d from the heat there@@ of .
therefore s@@ halt th@@ ou make them turn their back , when th@@ ou s@@ halt make ready th@@ ine ar@@ ro@@ ws upon TH@@ Y str@@ ings against the face of them .
I am p@@ oured out like water , and all my b@@ ones are out of joint : my heart is like wa@@ x ; it is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of my bo@@ wel@@ s .
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enem@@ ies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tab@@ ern@@ acle sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of joy ; I will sing , ye@@ a , I will sing pra@@ ises un@@ to the Lord .
give them according to their de@@ eds , and according to the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their en@@ deav@@ ours : give them after the work of their hands ; ren@@ der to them their de@@ sert .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pra@@ y un@@ to the@@ e in a time when th@@ ou may@@ est be found : su@@ rely in the floods of great waters they shall not come n@@ igh un@@ to him .
but in mine ad@@ versity they re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and gathered themselves together : ye@@ a , the ab@@ j@@ ects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ce@@ ased not :
rest in the Lord , and wait pati@@ ently for him : fre@@ t not th@@ y@@ self because of him who prosp@@ er@@ eth in his way , because of the man who br@@ ing@@ eth w@@ ic@@ ked devices to pass .
for yet a little while , and the w@@ ic@@ ked shall not be : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt dil@@ ig@@ ently consider his place , and it shall not be .
many , O Lord my God , are TH@@ Y won@@ der@@ ful works which th@@ ou h@@ ast done , and TH@@ Y th@@ ou@@ ghts which are to us @@@ -@@ @ ward : they can@@ not be rec@@ kon@@ ed up in order un@@ to the@@ e : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be num@@ ber@@ ed .
I have not hi@@ d TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness within my heart ; I have declared TH@@ Y fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and TH@@ Y sal@@ vation : I have not conce@@ aled TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness and TH@@ Y truth from the great Con@@ gre@@ gation .
for in@@ num@@ er@@ able ev@@ ils have comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : mine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be b@@ les@@ sed upon the ear@@ th : and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not deliver him un@@ to the will of his enem@@ ies .
Ye@@ a , mine own familiar friend , in whom I tr@@ usted , which did eat of my bread , hat@@ h lifted up his he@@ el against me .
yet the Lord will command his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the day@@ time , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my pray@@ er un@@ to the God of my life .
for they got not the land in possession by their own s@@ word , neither did their own arm save them : but TH@@ Y right hand , and th@@ ine arm , and the light of TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance , because th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st a favour un@@ to them .
he mak@@ eth wars to ce@@ ase un@@ to the end of the ear@@ th ; he break@@ eth the bo@@ w , and cut@@ te@@ th the spe@@ ar in s@@ under ; he bur@@ net@@ h the char@@ i@@ ot in the fire .
these things h@@ ast th@@ ou done , and I kept sil@@ ence ; th@@ ou th@@ ou@@ gh@@ test that I was altogether such an one as th@@ y@@ self : but I will re@@ prove the@@ e , and set them in order before th@@ ine eyes .
God shall likewise destroy the@@ e for ever , he shall take the@@ e away , and p@@ lu@@ ck the@@ e out of TH@@ Y d@@ wel@@ ling place , and root the@@ e out of the land of the living . Se@@ lah .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hat@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered the b@@ ones of him that en@@ camp@@ eth against the@@ e : th@@ ou h@@ ast put them to sh@@ ame , because God hat@@ h desp@@ ised them .
for it was not an enemy that re@@ pro@@ ached me ; then I could have bor@@ ne it : neither was it he that ha@@ ted me that did mag@@ ni@@ fy himself against me ; then I would have hi@@ d myself from him :
be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me , O God , be mer@@ ci@@ ful un@@ to me : for my sou@@ l tr@@ us@@ te@@ th in the@@ e : ye@@ a , in the shadow of TH@@ Y w@@ ings will I make my ref@@ uge , until these cal@@ am@@ ities be over@@ past .
my sou@@ l is among li@@ ons : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose te@@ eth are spe@@ ars and ar@@ ro@@ ws , and their ton@@ gue a sharp s@@ word .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my sou@@ l is bo@@ wed down : they have dig@@ ged a p@@ it before me , into the mid@@ st where@@ of they are fallen themselves . Se@@ lah .
as a s@@ na@@ il which mel@@ te@@ th , let every one of them pass away : like the un@@ ti@@ mely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
b@@ les@@ sed is the man whom th@@ ou choos@@ est , and ca@@ us@@ est to approach un@@ to the@@ e , that he may d@@ well in TH@@ Y courts : we shall be satisfied with the Go@@ od@@ ness of TH@@ Y house , even of TH@@ Y hol@@ y temp@@ le .
by ter@@ ri@@ ble things in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou answer us , O God of our sal@@ vation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the ear@@ th , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
the char@@ i@@ ots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of an@@ gel@@ s : the Lord is among them , as in S@@ ina@@ i , in the hol@@ y place .
to him that ri@@ de@@ th upon the heav@@ ens of heav@@ ens , which were of old ; lo , he do@@ th send out his voice , and that a m@@ igh@@ ty voice .
they that h@@ ate me without a cause are more than the ha@@ ir@@ s of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enem@@ ies wrong@@ fully , are m@@ igh@@ ty : then I restored that which I took not away .
but as for me , my pray@@ er is un@@ to the@@ e , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y mer@@ cy hear me , in the truth of TH@@ Y sal@@ vation .
re@@ pro@@ ach hat@@ h broken my heart ; and I am full of heav@@ iness : and I looked for some to take p@@ ity , but there was none ; and for comfor@@ ters , but I found none .
now also when I am old and gr@@ ay@@ headed , O God , for@@ sake me not ; until I have she@@ wed TH@@ Y strength un@@ to this generation , and TH@@ Y power to every one that is to come .
there shall be an hand@@ ful of cor@@ n in the ear@@ th upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit there@@ of shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th .
for in the hand of the Lord there is a c@@ up , and the wine is red ; it is full of mi@@ x@@ ture ; and he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out of the same : but the d@@ reg@@ s there@@ of , all the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th shall wr@@ ing them out , and drink them .
we will not hide them from their children , she@@ wing to the generation to come the pra@@ ises of the Lord , and his strength , and his won@@ der@@ ful works that he hat@@ h done .
and might not be as their fa@@ thers , a st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous generation ; a generation that set not their heart ar@@ ight , and whose spirit was not ste@@ d@@ fast with God .
the dead bodies of TH@@ Y servants have they given to be meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , the f@@ les@@ h of TH@@ Y sa@@ ints un@@ to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put away mine acqu@@ ain@@ tance far from me ; th@@ ou h@@ ast made me an ab@@ omin@@ ation un@@ to them : I am shut up , and I can@@ not come forth .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish th@@ ou the work of our hands upon us ; ye@@ a , the work of our hands establish th@@ ou it .
the Lord re@@ ig@@ net@@ h , he is clo@@ th@@ ed with maj@@ es@@ ty ; the Lord is clo@@ th@@ ed with strength , where@@ with he hat@@ h gir@@ ded himself : the world also is st@@ ab@@ lis@@ hed , that it can@@ not be moved .
the Lord hat@@ h been min@@ d@@ ful of us : he will b@@ less us ; he will b@@ less the house of Israel ; he will b@@ less the house of Aaron .
be@@ hold , as the eyes of servants look un@@ to the hand of their mas@@ ters , and as the eyes of a ma@@ iden un@@ to the hand of her mist@@ ress ; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God , until that he have mer@@ cy upon us .
though I walk in the mid@@ st of trouble , th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t revive me : th@@ ou s@@ halt stretch forth th@@ ine hand against the wr@@ ath of mine enem@@ ies , and TH@@ Y right hand shall save me .
Th@@ ine eyes did see my sub@@ stance , yet being un@@ perfect ; and in TH@@ Y book all my members were written , which in continu@@ ance were fas@@ hi@@ oned , when as yet there was none of them .
let the righ@@ te@@ ous sm@@ ite me ; it shall be a kin@@ d@@ ness : and let him re@@ prove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my pray@@ er also shall be in their cal@@ am@@ ities .
when my spirit was overwhel@@ med within me , then th@@ ou k@@ newest my path . in the way where@@ in I walked have they priv@@ ily laid a sn@@ are for me .
for the enemy hat@@ h persec@@ uted my sou@@ l ; he hat@@ h s@@ mit@@ ten my life down to the ground ; he hat@@ h made me to d@@ well in d@@ ark@@ ness , as those that have been long dead .
cause me to hear TH@@ Y lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ ness in the morning ; for in the@@ e do I trust : cause me to know the way where@@ in I should walk ; for I lift up my sou@@ l un@@ to the@@ e .
when th@@ ou li@@ est down , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be afraid : ye@@ a , th@@ ou s@@ halt lie down , and TH@@ Y sle@@ ep shall be swe@@ et .
even a fo@@ ol , when he hol@@ de@@ th his peace , is counted wise : and he that shut@@ te@@ th his li@@ ps is es@@ te@@ emed a man of understanding .
a man 's bel@@ ly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his m@@ outh ; and with the increase of his li@@ ps shall he be filled .
the fear of the Lord ten@@ de@@ th to life : and he that hat@@ h it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with ev@@ il .
it is a sn@@ are to the man who dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th that which is hol@@ y , and after vows to make inquiry .
if th@@ ou say@@ est , be@@ hold , we knew it not ; do@@ th not he that pon@@ der@@ eth the heart consider it ? and he that keep@@ eth TH@@ Y sou@@ l , do@@ th not he know it ? and shall not he ren@@ der to every man according to his works ?
if th@@ ine enemy be hun@@ gry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thir@@ st@@ y , give him water to drink :
Th@@ ine own friend , and TH@@ Y father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into TH@@ Y brother 's house in the day of TH@@ Y cal@@ am@@ ity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ id .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wis@@ dom concerning all things that are done under heav@@ en : this sor@@ e trav@@ ail hat@@ h God given to the sons of man to be exerc@@ ised there@@ with .
I commun@@ ed with mine own heart , saying , L@@ o , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wis@@ dom than all they that have been before me in Jer@@ usalem : ye@@ a , my heart had great experience of wis@@ dom and knowledge .
I gathered me also silver and gold , and the pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar treasure of kings and of the provinces : I g@@ at me men singers and women singers , and the deli@@ ghts of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sor@@ ts .
then I looked on all the works that my hands had w@@ rought , and on the labour that I had la@@ b@@ oured to do : and , be@@ hold , all was van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
for there is no re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of the wise more than of the fo@@ ol for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how di@@ eth the wise man ? as the fo@@ ol .
and who know@@ eth whether he shall be a wise man or a fo@@ ol ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour where@@ in I have la@@ b@@ oured , and where@@ in I have she@@ wed myself wise under the sun . this is also van@@ ity .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his sou@@ l enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
so I returned , and considered all the op@@ pres@@ sions that are done under the sun : and be@@ hold the te@@ ars of such as were op@@ pressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but wo@@ e to him that is alone when he fal@@ le@@ th ; for he hat@@ h not another to help him up .
there is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them : they also that come after shall not re@@ jo@@ ice in him . su@@ rely this also is van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
be not ras@@ h with TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and let not th@@ ine heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter any thing before God : for God is in heav@@ en , and th@@ ou upon ear@@ th : therefore let TH@@ Y words be few .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners there@@ of , saving the be@@ holding of them with their eyes ?
as he came forth of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nak@@ ed shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
all things have I seen in the days of my van@@ ity : there is a just man that per@@ is@@ het@@ h in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and there is a w@@ ic@@ ked man that prol@@ on@@ get@@ h his life in his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
it is good that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest take hold of this ; ye@@ a , also from this withdraw not th@@ ine hand : for he that fear@@ eth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wis@@ dom , and the reason of things , and to know the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Fol@@ ly , even of fo@@ ol@@ ishness and mad@@ ness :
which yet my sou@@ l seek@@ eth , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
and so I saw the w@@ ic@@ ked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the hol@@ y , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also van@@ ity .
because sentence against an ev@@ il work is not executed spe@@ edil@@ y , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do ev@@ il .
there is a van@@ ity which is done upon the ear@@ th ; that there be just men , un@@ to whom it happen@@ eth according to the work of the w@@ ic@@ ked ; again , there be w@@ ic@@ ked men , to whom it happen@@ eth according to the work of the righ@@ te@@ ous : I said that this also is van@@ ity .
when I applied mine heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done upon the ear@@ th : ( for also there is that neither day nor night se@@ eth sle@@ ep with his eyes : )
also their love , and their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y , is now per@@ ished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
for man also know@@ eth not his time : as the fis@@ hes that are taken in an ev@@ il net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are ; so are the sons of men s@@ nar@@ ed in an ev@@ il time , when it fal@@ le@@ th su@@ d@@ den@@ ly upon them .
dead f@@ lies cause the o@@ in@@ tment of the ap@@ o@@ th@@ ec@@ ary to send forth a st@@ in@@ king sav@@ our : so do@@ th a little Fol@@ ly him that is in reputation for wis@@ dom and honour .
Ye@@ a also , when he that is a fo@@ ol walk@@ eth by the way , his wis@@ dom fail@@ eth him , and he sa@@ ith to every one that he is a fo@@ ol .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the ear@@ th : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fal@@ le@@ th , there it shall be .
as th@@ ou know@@ est not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the b@@ ones do grow in the w@@ om@@ b of her that is with child : even so th@@ ou know@@ est not the works of God who mak@@ eth all .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the gr@@ in@@ ding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of musi@@ ck shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cor@@ d be lo@@ os@@ ed , or the golden bo@@ w@@ l be broken , or the pit@@ cher be broken at the fo@@ un@@ tain , or the whe@@ el broken at the c@@ ister@@ n .
look not upon me , because I am black , because the sun hat@@ h looked upon me : my mother 's children were angry with me ; they made me the keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards ; but mine own v@@ ine@@ yard have I not kept .
if th@@ ou know not , O th@@ ou fa@@ i@@ rest among women , go TH@@ Y way forth by the foot@@ steps of the flock , and fe@@ ed TH@@ Y kids bes@@ ide the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ' ten@@ ts .
as the app@@ le tree among the trees of the wood , so is my bel@@ ov@@ ed among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great de@@ light , and his fruit was swe@@ et to my tas@@ te .
the flowers appear on the ear@@ th ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the tur@@ tle is heard in our land ;
O my do@@ ve , that art in the cle@@ fts of the rock , in the secret places of the st@@ airs , let me see TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance , let me hear TH@@ Y voice ; for swe@@ et is TH@@ Y voice , and TH@@ Y coun@@ tenance is co@@ mely .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
it was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ eth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , and into the chamber of her that conce@@ ived me .
he made the pil@@ lars there@@ of of silver , the bottom there@@ of of gold , the covering of it of pur@@ ple , the mid@@ st there@@ of being paved with love , for the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem .
go forth , O ye da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and be@@ hold king Solomon with the cro@@ wn where@@ with his mother crow@@ ned him in the day of his es@@ po@@ us@@ als , and in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart .
until the day break , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , I will get me to the mountain of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , and to the hill of fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
come with me from Lebanon , my sp@@ o@@ use , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of S@@ hen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the li@@ ons ' den@@ s , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
I opened to my bel@@ ov@@ ed ; but my bel@@ ov@@ ed had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my sou@@ l failed when he sp@@ ake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
TH@@ Y nec@@ k is as a to@@ wer of Iv@@ ory ; th@@ ine eyes like the fis@@ h@@ po@@ ols in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , by the gate of B@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ rab@@ bi@@ m : TH@@ Y n@@ ose is as the to@@ wer of Lebanon which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward Dam@@ as@@ cus .
O that th@@ ou w@@ ert as my brother , that suc@@ ked the bre@@ asts of my mother ! when I should find the@@ e without , I would k@@ is@@ s the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I should not be desp@@ ised .
I would lead the@@ e , and bring the@@ e into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me : I would cause the@@ e to drink of sp@@ ic@@ ed wine of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even un@@ to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it ; but wounds , and bru@@ ises , and p@@ ut@@ rif@@ ying so@@ res : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither m@@ ol@@ lified with o@@ in@@ tment .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow un@@ to it .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots :
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lo@@ f@@ ty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
and they shall go into the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and into the c@@ aves of the ear@@ th , for fear of the Lord , and for the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty , when he ar@@ is@@ eth to shake ter@@ ri@@ bly the ear@@ th .
and the people shall be op@@ pressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall be@@ have himself pro@@ u@@ dly against the ancient , and the base against the honour@@ able .
and it shall come to pass , that instead of swe@@ et s@@ me@@ ll there shall be st@@ ink ; and instead of a gir@@ dle a rent ; and instead of well set ha@@ ir bal@@ d@@ ness ; and instead of a st@@ om@@ acher a gir@@ ding of s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th ; and burning instead of beauty .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Z@@ ion , and he that remain@@ eth in Jer@@ usalem , shall be called hol@@ y , even every one that is written among the living in Jer@@ usalem :
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from the mid@@ st there@@ of by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
and the Lord will create upon every d@@ wel@@ ling place of mount Z@@ ion , and upon her assemb@@ lies , a cl@@ oud and smoke by day , and the sh@@ ining of a f@@ laming fire by night : for upon all the gl@@ ory shall be a defence .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? where@@ fore , when I looked that it should bring forth grap@@ es , brought it forth wild grap@@ es ?
and now go to ; I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard : I will take away the h@@ edge there@@ of , and it shall be e@@ aten up ; and break down the wall there@@ of , and it shall be tro@@ dden down :
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pip@@ e , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the m@@ igh@@ ty man shall be hum@@ b@@ led , and the eyes of the lo@@ f@@ ty shall be hum@@ b@@ led :
that say , Let him make speed , and has@@ ten his work , that we may see it : and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw n@@ igh and come , that we may know it !
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will his@@ s un@@ to them from the end of the ear@@ th : and , be@@ hold , they shall come with speed swi@@ f@@ tly :
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the gir@@ dle of their lo@@ ins be lo@@ os@@ ed , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
their ro@@ aring shall be like a lion , they shall ro@@ ar like young li@@ ons : ye@@ a , they shall ro@@ ar , and lay hold of the pre@@ y , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and it came to pass in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that Re@@ z@@ in the king of Syria , and Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up toward Jer@@ usalem to war against it , but could not prev@@ ail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is conf@@ eder@@ ate with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
and say un@@ to him , T@@ ake heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fa@@ in@@ the@@ ar@@ ted for the two ta@@ ils of these smoking fire@@ brands , for the fierce an@@ ger of Re@@ z@@ in with Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
let us go up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and ve@@ x it , and let us make a breach there@@ in for us , and set a king in the mid@@ st of it , even the son of T@@ ab@@ e@@ al :
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall his@@ s for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the de@@ so@@ late val@@ ley@@ s , and in the ho@@ les of the ro@@ cks , and upon all thor@@ ns , and upon all bus@@ hes .
in the same day shall the Lord s@@ have with a ras@@ or that is hired , name@@ ly , by them beyond the river , by the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head , and the ha@@ ir of the feet : and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
and it shall come to pass , for the ab@@ und@@ ance of milk that they shall give he shall eat but@@ ter : for but@@ ter and hon@@ ey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
and on all hil@@ ls that shall be dig@@ ged with the mat@@ to@@ ck , there shall not come th@@ ither the fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of les@@ ser c@@ attle .
for the Lord sp@@ ake thus to me with a strong hand , and instruc@@ ted me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
and he shall be for a sanc@@ tu@@ ary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of off@@ ence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a sn@@ are to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bes@@ te@@ ad and hun@@ gry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hun@@ gry , they shall fre@@ t themselves , and cur@@ se their king and their God , and look up@@ ward .
for w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess bur@@ net@@ h as the fire : it shall dev@@ our the bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns , and shall kin@@ dle in the th@@ ic@@ kets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
and he shall sn@@ at@@ ch on the right hand , and be hun@@ gry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the f@@ les@@ h of his own arm :
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your gl@@ ory ?
shall the ax@@ e bo@@ ast itself against him that he@@ w@@ eth there@@ with ? or shall the saw mag@@ ni@@ fy itself against him that shak@@ eth it ? as if the ro@@ d should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a fla@@ me : and it shall bur@@ n and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel , and such as are escaped of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , shall no more again stay upon him that smo@@ te them ; but shall stay upon the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off TH@@ Y nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting .
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither re@@ prove after the hearing of his e@@ ars :
but with righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall he judge the poor , and re@@ prove with equ@@ ity for the me@@ ek of the ear@@ th : and he shall sm@@ ite the ear@@ th with the ro@@ d of his m@@ outh , and with the bre@@ ath of his li@@ ps shall he s@@ lay the w@@ ic@@ ked .
and in that day there shall be a root of J@@ es@@ se , which shall stand for an en@@ sign of the people ; to it shall the Gen@@ ti@@ les seek : and his rest shall be g@@ lor@@ ious .
and he shall set up an en@@ sign for the nations , and shall assem@@ ble the out@@ casts of Israel , and gather together the disper@@ sed of Ju@@ da@@ h from the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th .
but they shall fly upon the sho@@ ul@@ ders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall sp@@ oil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ a@@ b ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obe@@ y them .
for the stars of heav@@ en and the con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations there@@ of shall not give their light : the sun shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to sh@@ ine .
and it shall be as the ch@@ ased ro@@ e , and as a she@@ ep that no man tak@@ eth up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
their bo@@ ws also shall d@@ ash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b ; their eye shall not spar@@ e children .
and the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall cry in their de@@ so@@ late houses , and dra@@ g@@ ons in their pleas@@ ant pal@@ aces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prol@@ on@@ ged .
for the Lord will have mer@@ cy on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the st@@ ran@@ gers shall be joined with them , and they shall cle@@ ave to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give the@@ e rest from TH@@ Y sor@@ row , and from TH@@ Y fear , and from the hard bon@@ da@@ ge where@@ in th@@ ou w@@ ast made to serve ,
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and upon my mountains tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot : then shall his yok@@ e de@@ part from off them , and his burden de@@ part from off their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
re@@ jo@@ ice not th@@ ou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the ro@@ d of him that smo@@ te the@@ e is broken : for out of the ser@@ p@@ ent 's root shall come forth a co@@ c@@ kat@@ ri@@ ce , and his fruit shall be a fi@@ ery flying ser@@ p@@ ent .
and H@@ es@@ h@@ bon shall cry , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : their voice shall be heard even un@@ to Ja@@ haz : therefore the armed soldiers of Mo@@ a@@ b shall cry out ; his life shall be gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ to him .
my heart shall cry out for Mo@@ a@@ b ; his fugitives shall flee un@@ to Zo@@ ar , an he@@ if@@ er of three years old : for by the mounting up of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping shall they go it up ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
and in mer@@ cy shall the th@@ r@@ one be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David , jud@@ ging , and seeking judgment , and has@@ ting righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b ; he is very proud : even of his ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess , and his pride , and his wr@@ ath : but his lies shall not be so .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Mo@@ a@@ b is we@@ ary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanc@@ tu@@ ary to pra@@ y ; but he shall not prev@@ ail .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the gl@@ ory of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be made th@@ in , and the fat@@ ness of his f@@ les@@ h shall wa@@ x le@@ an .
and he shall not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fin@@ gers have made , either the gro@@ ves , or the images .
in the day s@@ halt th@@ ou make TH@@ Y plant to grow , and in the morning s@@ halt th@@ ou make TH@@ Y se@@ ed to flo@@ ur@@ ish : but the har@@ v@@ est shall be a he@@ ap in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
Wo@@ e to the multi@@ tude of many people , which make a no@@ ise like the no@@ ise of the seas ; and to the rus@@ hing of nations , that make a rus@@ hing like the rus@@ hing of m@@ igh@@ ty waters !
the nations shall rush like the rus@@ hing of many waters : but God shall re@@ bu@@ ke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be ch@@ ased as the c@@ haf@@ f of the mountains before the wind , and like a rol@@ ling thing before the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind .
for a@@ fore the har@@ v@@ est , when the bu@@ d is perfect , and the s@@ our gra@@ pe is ri@@ pen@@ ing in the f@@ lower , he shall both cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and take away and cut down the branches .
they shall be left together un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the mountains , and to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th : and the fo@@ w@@ ls shall summer upon them , and all the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th shall winter upon them .
the burden of Egypt . be@@ hold , the Lord ri@@ de@@ th upon a swift cl@@ oud , and shall come into Egypt : and the id@@ ols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall mel@@ t in the mid@@ st of it .
and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the mid@@ st there@@ of ; and I will destroy the coun@@ sel there@@ of : and they shall seek to the id@@ ols , and to the char@@ mers , and to them that have familiar spir@@ its , and to the w@@ iz@@ ards .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the bro@@ oks of defence shall be emp@@ tied and dri@@ ed up : the re@@ eds and flags shall wi@@ ther .
the paper re@@ eds by the bro@@ oks , by the m@@ outh of the bro@@ oks , and every thing so@@ wn by the bro@@ oks , shall wi@@ ther , be driven away , and be no more .
in that day shall Egypt be like un@@ to women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shak@@ eth over it .
and the land of Ju@@ da@@ h shall be a terror un@@ to Egypt , every one that mak@@ eth mention there@@ of shall be afraid in himself , because of the coun@@ sel of the Lord of hosts , which he hat@@ h determined against it .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w un@@ to the Lord , and perform it .
and the Lord shall sm@@ ite Egypt : he shall sm@@ ite and he@@ al it : and they shall return even to the Lord , and he shall be in@@ treated of them , and shall he@@ al them .
therefore are my lo@@ ins filled with p@@ ain : pan@@ gs have taken hold upon me , as the pan@@ gs of a woman that trav@@ ail@@ eth : I was bo@@ wed down at the hearing of it ; I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the seeing of it .
what h@@ ast th@@ ou here ? and whom h@@ ast th@@ ou here , that th@@ ou h@@ ast he@@ wed the@@ e out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re here , as he that he@@ w@@ eth him out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on high , and that gra@@ vet@@ h an habi@@ tation for himself in a rock ?
and I will clo@@ the him with TH@@ Y ro@@ be , and strengthen him with TH@@ Y gir@@ dle , and I will commit TH@@ Y government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his sho@@ ul@@ der ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and they shall han@@ g upon him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , all vessels of small quanti@@ ty , from the vessels of c@@ ups , even to all the vessels of fla@@ g@@ ons .
he stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , he sho@@ ok the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms : the Lord hat@@ h given a comman@@ d@@ ment against the mer@@ chan@@ t city , to destroy the strong holds there@@ of .
and it shall come to pass after the end of sev@@ enty years , that the Lord will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall turn to her h@@ ire , and shall commit for@@ nic@@ ation with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world upon the face of the ear@@ th .
when thus it shall be in the mid@@ st of the land among the people , there shall be as the shak@@ ing of an olive tree , and as the g@@ le@@ an@@ ing grap@@ es when the vin@@ t@@ age is done .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fle@@ eth from the no@@ ise of the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he that co@@ me@@ th up out of the mid@@ st of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the ear@@ th do shake .
the ear@@ th shall reel to and f@@ ro like a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d , and shall be removed like a cot@@ t@@ age ; and the trans@@ gres@@ sion there@@ of shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th upon the ear@@ th .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers , as the heat in a d@@ ry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cl@@ oud : the branch of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make un@@ to all people a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of win@@ es on the le@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of win@@ es on the le@@ es well refin@@ ed .
he will sw@@ allow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wi@@ pe away te@@ ars from off all faces ; and the re@@ bu@@ ke of his people shall he take away from off all the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
and it shall be said in that day , L@@ o , this is our God ; we have w@@ aited for him , and he will save us : this is the Lord ; we have w@@ aited for him , we will be glad and re@@ jo@@ ice in his sal@@ vation .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the mid@@ st of them , as he that swim@@ me@@ th sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th forth his hands to sw@@ im : and he shall bring down their pride together with the sp@@ o@@ ils of their hands .
and the fortress of the high For@@ t of TH@@ Y walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the d@@ ust .
for he br@@ ing@@ eth down them that d@@ well on high ; the lo@@ f@@ ty city , he lay@@ eth it low ; he lay@@ eth it low , even to the ground ; he br@@ ing@@ eth it even to the d@@ ust .
Ye@@ a , in the way of TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , O Lord , have we w@@ aited for the@@ e ; the desire of our sou@@ l is to TH@@ Y name , and to the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of the@@ e .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red the@@ e in the night ; ye@@ a , with my spirit within me will I seek the@@ e early : for when TH@@ Y judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world will learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let favour be she@@ wed to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet will he not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness : in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness will he deal un@@ j@@ ust@@ ly , and will not be@@ hold the maj@@ es@@ ty of the Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in p@@ ain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not w@@ rought any deliver@@ ance in the ear@@ th ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter th@@ ou into TH@@ Y ch@@ ambers , and shut TH@@ Y doors about the@@ e : hide th@@ y@@ self as it were for a little moment , until the in@@ dign@@ ation be over@@ past .
when the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of are with@@ ered , they shall be broken off : the women come , and set them on fire : for it is a people of no understanding : therefore he that made them will not have mer@@ cy on them , and he that formed them will she@@ w them no favour .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall beat off from the channel of the river un@@ to the stream of Egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , O ye children of Israel .
and your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with death shall be dis@@ annulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the over@@ flow@@ ing s@@ cour@@ ge shall pass through , then ye shall be tro@@ dden down by it .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narro@@ wer than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the f@@ it@@ ches are not th@@ res@@ hed with a th@@ res@@ hing instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned about upon the cum@@ min ; but the f@@ it@@ ches are beaten out with a staff , and the cum@@ min with a ro@@ d .
moreover the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y st@@ ran@@ gers shall be like small d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ter@@ ri@@ ble ones shall be as c@@ haf@@ f that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an in@@ stan@@ t su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the Lord said , For@@ as@@ much as this people draw near me with their m@@ outh , and with their li@@ ps do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is ta@@ ught by the prec@@ ep@@ t of men :
therefore , be@@ hold , I will proceed to do a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous work among this people , even a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous work and a wonder : for the wis@@ dom of their wise men shall per@@ ish , and the understanding of their pru@@ dent men shall be hi@@ d .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field shall be es@@ te@@ emed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the de@@ af hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d shall see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity , and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the mid@@ st of him , they shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy my name , and sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Holy One of Jac@@ o@@ b , and shall fear the God of Israel .
that walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked at my m@@ outh ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
for the people shall d@@ well in Z@@ ion at Jer@@ usalem : th@@ ou s@@ halt we@@ ep no more : he will be very gr@@ ac@@ ious un@@ to the@@ e at the voice of TH@@ Y cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer the@@ e .
and th@@ ine e@@ ars shall hear a word behind the@@ e , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Y@@ e shall def@@ ile also the covering of TH@@ Y Gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of TH@@ Y m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold : th@@ ou s@@ halt cast them away as a men@@ stru@@ ous clo@@ th ; th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to it , G@@ et the@@ e hence .
then shall he give the rain of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , that th@@ ou s@@ halt so@@ w the ground with@@ al ; and bread of the increase of the ear@@ th , and it shall be f@@ at and plen@@ te@@ ous : in that day shall TH@@ Y c@@ attle fe@@ ed in large pas@@ tures .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and stre@@ ams of waters in the day of the great sla@@ ughter , when the tow@@ ers fall .
and his bre@@ ath , as an over@@ flow@@ ing stream , shall reach to the mid@@ st of the nec@@ k , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of van@@ ity : and there shall be a bri@@ dle in the j@@ a@@ ws of the people , causing them to er@@ r .
Y@@ e shall have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y so@@ lem@@ n@@ ity is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one go@@ eth with a pip@@ e to come into the mountain of the Lord , to the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Israel .
and the Lord shall cause his g@@ lor@@ ious voice to be heard , and shall she@@ w the ligh@@ ting down of his arm , with the in@@ dign@@ ation of his an@@ ger , and with the fla@@ me of a dev@@ our@@ ing fire , with sc@@ at@@ tering , and temp@@ est , and ha@@ il@@ stones .
and in every place where the gro@@ unded staff shall pass , which the Lord shall lay upon him , it shall be with tab@@ re@@ ts and har@@ ps : and in batt@@ les of shak@@ ing will he fight with it .
Wo@@ e to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on hor@@ ses , and trust in char@@ i@@ ots , because they are many ; and in hor@@ se@@ men , because they are very strong ; but they look not un@@ to the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the Lord !
yet he also is wise , and will bring ev@@ il , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of them that work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
now the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans are men , and not God ; and their hor@@ ses f@@ les@@ h , and not spirit . when the Lord shall stretch out his hand , both he that hel@@ pet@@ h shall fall , and he that is hol@@ p@@ en shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
for in that day every man shall cast away his id@@ ols of silver , and his id@@ ols of gold , which your own hands have made un@@ to you for a sin .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a cover@@ t from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a d@@ ry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a we@@ ary land .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than th@@ ou can@@ st perce@@ ive ; of a st@@ ammer@@ ing ton@@ gue , that th@@ ou can@@ st not understand .
their sla@@ in also shall be cast out , and their st@@ ink shall come up out of their car@@ cases , and the mountains shall be mel@@ ted with their blood .
and all the host of heav@@ en shall be dis@@ solved , and the heav@@ ens shall be rol@@ led together as a s@@ cr@@ oll : and all their host shall fall down , as the le@@ af fal@@ le@@ th off from the v@@ ine , and as a falling fi@@ g from the fi@@ g tree .
it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched night nor day ; the smoke there@@ of shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cor@@ mor@@ ant and the bit@@ tern shall poss@@ ess it ; the ow@@ l also and the ra@@ ven shall d@@ well in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of conf@@ usion , and the stones of emp@@ tin@@ ess .
and thor@@ ns shall come up in her pal@@ aces , net@@ t@@ les and br@@ amb@@ les in the for@@ t@@ resses there@@ of : and it shall be an habi@@ tation of dra@@ g@@ ons , and a court for ow@@ ls .
the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert shall also meet with the wild be@@ asts of the island , and the sat@@ y@@ r shall cry to his fellow ; the scre@@ ech ow@@ l also shall rest there , and find for her@@ self a place of rest .
it shall b@@ los@@ so@@ m ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and re@@ jo@@ ice even with joy and singing : the gl@@ ory of Lebanon shall be given un@@ to it , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of Car@@ mel and Shar@@ on , they shall see the gl@@ ory of the Lord , and the exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy of our God .
I say , say@@ est th@@ ou , ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) I have coun@@ sel and strength for war : now on whom dost th@@ ou trust , that th@@ ou rebel@@ lest against me ?
L@@ o , th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test in the staff of this broken Re@@ ed , on Egypt ; where@@ on if a man le@@ an , it will go into his hand , and Pi@@ erce it : so is P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt to all that trust in him .
now therefore give pledges , I pra@@ y the@@ e , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give the@@ e two thousand hor@@ ses , if th@@ ou be able on TH@@ Y part to set ri@@ ders upon them .
how then w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put TH@@ Y trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , He@@ ar ye the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will su@@ rely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
then came Eli@@ ak@@ im , the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , that was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of A@@ sap@@ h , the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es rent , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
and it came to pass , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he rent his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of the Lord .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , Let not TH@@ Y God , in whom th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ test , dec@@ e@@ ive the@@ e , saying , Jer@@ usalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , as G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den which were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up un@@ to the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire : for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
whom h@@ ast th@@ ou re@@ pro@@ ached and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? and against whom h@@ ast th@@ ou ex@@ al@@ ted TH@@ Y voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest be to lay waste def@@ enced cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and con@@ founded : they were as the gr@@ ass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the gr@@ ass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as cor@@ n b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
because TH@@ Y ra@@ ge against me , and TH@@ Y t@@ um@@ ult , is come up into mine e@@ ars , therefore will I put my ho@@ ok in TH@@ Y n@@ ose , and my bri@@ dle in TH@@ Y li@@ ps , and I will turn the@@ e back by the way by which th@@ ou ca@@ me@@ st .
then the an@@ gel of the Lord went forth , and smo@@ te in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans a hundred and fo@@ ur@@ score and five thousand : and when they ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , they were all dead cor@@ p@@ ses .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of Nis@@ ro@@ ch his go@@ d , that Ad@@ ram@@ me@@ le@@ ch and Shar@@ ez@@ er his sons smo@@ te him with the s@@ word ; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and E@@ sar @@@ -@@ @ h@@ add@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his stead .
and said , Re@@ member now , O Lord , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , how I have walked before the@@ e in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in TH@@ Y sight . and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah we@@ pt sor@@ e .
mine age is depar@@ ted , and is removed from me as a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d 's tent : I have cut off like a we@@ av@@ er my life : he will cut me off with p@@ ining si@@ ck@@ ness : from day even to night w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou make an end of me .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great bit@@ ter@@ ness : but th@@ ou h@@ ast in love to my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption : for th@@ ou h@@ ast cast all my sin@@ s behind TH@@ Y back .
at that time Mer@@ od@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ adan , the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah : for he had heard that he had been si@@ ck , and was recovered .
be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which TH@@ Y fa@@ thers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and of TH@@ Y sons that shall issue from the@@ e , which th@@ ou s@@ halt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he shall fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : he shall gather the lam@@ bs with his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om , and shall g@@ ently lead those that are with young .
who hat@@ h meas@@ ured the waters in the hol@@ low of his hand , and me@@ ted out heav@@ en with the sp@@ an , and compre@@ hen@@ ded the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scal@@ es , and the hil@@ ls in a balance ?
be@@ hold , the nations are as a drop of a bu@@ c@@ ket , and are counted as the small d@@ ust of the balance : be@@ hold , he tak@@ eth up the is@@ les as a very little thing .
it is he that sit@@ te@@ th upon the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and the inhabitants there@@ of are as gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; that stret@@ ch@@ eth out the heav@@ ens as a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ re@@ ade@@ th them out as a tent to d@@ well in :
H@@ ast th@@ ou not known ? h@@ ast th@@ ou not heard , that the ever@@ lasting God , the Lord , the Cre@@ ator of the ends of the ear@@ th , fa@@ in@@ te@@ th not , neither is we@@ ary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
so the car@@ pen@@ ter encouraged the gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h , and he that smoo@@ th@@ eth with the ham@@ mer him that smo@@ te the an@@ vil , saying , It is ready for the so@@ dering : and he fas@@ tened it with n@@ ails , that it should not be moved .
T@@ ho@@ u whom I have taken from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called the@@ e from the chief men there@@ of , and said un@@ to the@@ e , T@@ ho@@ u art my ser@@ vant ; I have chosen the@@ e , and not cast the@@ e away .
fear th@@ ou not ; for I am with the@@ e : be not dis@@ may@@ ed ; for I am TH@@ Y God : I will strengthen the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I will help the@@ e ; ye@@ a , I will up@@ hold the@@ e with the right hand of my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt seek them , and s@@ halt not find them , even them that conten@@ ded with the@@ e : they that war against the@@ e shall be as nothing , and as a thing of n@@ ought .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ at@@ ter them : and th@@ ou s@@ halt re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord , and s@@ halt gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers in high places , and fo@@ un@@ tains in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s : I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
I will plant in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness the c@@ ed@@ ar , the sh@@ it@@ ta@@ h tree , and the m@@ yr@@ tle , and the oil tree ; I will set in the de@@ sert the f@@ ir tree , and the p@@ ine , and the box tree together :
let them bring them forth , and she@@ w us what shall happen : let them she@@ w the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon pr@@ inces as upon mor@@ ter , and as the P@@ ot@@ ter tre@@ ade@@ th cla@@ y .
who hat@@ h declared from the beginning , that we may know ? and be@@ fore@@ time , that we may say , He is righ@@ te@@ ous ? ye@@ a , there is none that she@@ w@@ eth , ye@@ a , there is none that declar@@ eth , ye@@ a , there is none that he@@ aret@@ h your words .
for I be@@ held , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no coun@@ seller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
thus sa@@ ith God the Lord , he that created the heav@@ ens , and stret@@ ched them out ; he that spread forth the ear@@ th , and that which co@@ me@@ th out of it ; he that gi@@ vet@@ h bre@@ ath un@@ to the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk there@@ in :
let the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and the cities there@@ of lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ ed@@ ar do@@ th in@@ ha@@ bit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them sh@@ out from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a m@@ igh@@ ty man , he shall stir up je@@ al@@ ous@@ y like a man of war : he shall cry , ye@@ a , ro@@ ar ; he shall prev@@ ail against his enem@@ ies .
therefore he hat@@ h p@@ oured upon him the fur@@ y of his an@@ ger , and the strength of battle : and it hat@@ h set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
when th@@ ou pass@@ est through the waters , I will be with the@@ e ; and through the rivers , they shall not over@@ flow the@@ e : when th@@ ou walk@@ est through the fire , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be burned ; neither shall the fla@@ me kin@@ dle upon the@@ e .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , your re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel ; For your sake I have sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and have brought down all their no@@ bles , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , whose cry is in the ships .
the be@@ ast of the field shall honour me , the dra@@ g@@ ons and the ow@@ ls : because I give waters in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and rivers in the de@@ sert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast not brought me the small c@@ attle of TH@@ Y bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings ; neither h@@ ast th@@ ou honoured me with TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . I have not caused the@@ e to serve with an offering , nor we@@ ar@@ ied the@@ e with incen@@ se .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , neither h@@ ast th@@ ou filled me with the f@@ at of TH@@ Y sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es : but th@@ ou h@@ ast made me to serve with TH@@ Y sin@@ s , th@@ ou h@@ ast we@@ ar@@ ied me with th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
be@@ hold , all his fel@@ lows shall be as@@ ha@@ med : and the work@@ men , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be as@@ ha@@ med together .
the S@@ mit@@ h with the ton@@ gs both wor@@ ket@@ h in the co@@ als , and fas@@ hi@@ on@@ eth it with ham@@ mers , and wor@@ ket@@ h it with the strength of his arms : ye@@ a , he is hun@@ gry , and his strength fail@@ eth : he drin@@ ket@@ h no water , and is fa@@ int .
I will go before the@@ e , and make the cro@@ oked places stra@@ ight : I will break in pieces the gates of br@@ ass , and cut in s@@ under the bars of iron :
and I will give the@@ e the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that th@@ ou may@@ est know that I , the Lord , which call the@@ e by TH@@ Y name , am the God of Israel .
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none bes@@ ide me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
they la@@ vis@@ h gold out of the bag , and we@@ igh silver in the balance , and h@@ ire a gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h ; and he mak@@ eth it a go@@ d : they fall down , ye@@ a , they worship .
they bear him upon the sho@@ ul@@ der , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he stan@@ de@@ th ; from his place shall he not remove : ye@@ a , one shall cry un@@ to him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
calling a ra@@ ven@@ ous bird from the east , the man that execu@@ te@@ th my coun@@ sel from a far country : ye@@ a , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have pur@@ posed it , I will also do it .
and th@@ ou sa@@ id@@ st , I shall be a la@@ dy for ever : so that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not lay these things to TH@@ Y heart , neither di@@ d@@ st remember the latter end of it .
stand now with th@@ ine en@@ chan@@ tments , and with the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y sor@@ cer@@ ies , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured from TH@@ Y youth ; if so be th@@ ou s@@ halt be able to profit , if so be th@@ ou may@@ est prev@@ ail .
hear ye this , O house of Jac@@ o@@ b , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Ju@@ da@@ h , which swe@@ ar by the name of the Lord , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I she@@ wed them ; I did them su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and they came to pass .
I have even from the beginning declared it to the@@ e ; before it came to pass I she@@ wed it the@@ e : lest th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest say , M@@ ine i@@ dol hat@@ h done them , and my Gra@@ ven image , and my m@@ ol@@ ten image , hat@@ h comman@@ ded them .
Ye@@ a , th@@ ou hear@@ dest not ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou k@@ newest not ; ye@@ a , from that time that th@@ ine e@@ ar was not opened : for I knew that th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest deal very t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and w@@ ast called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the w@@ om@@ b .
come ye near un@@ to me , hear ye this ; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I : and now the Lord God , and his Spiri@@ t , hat@@ h sent me .
and they thir@@ s@@ ted not when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he cla@@ ve the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
listen , O is@@ les , un@@ to me ; and he@@ arken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hat@@ h called me from the w@@ om@@ b ; from the bo@@ wel@@ s of my mother hat@@ h he made mention of my name .
and he hat@@ h made my m@@ outh like a sharp s@@ word ; in the shadow of his hand hat@@ h he hi@@ d me , and made me a pol@@ ished S@@ haf@@ t ; in his qu@@ i@@ ver hat@@ h he hi@@ d me ;
the children which th@@ ou s@@ halt have , after th@@ ou h@@ ast lost the other , shall say again in th@@ ine e@@ ars , The place is too stra@@ it for me : give place to me that I may d@@ well .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God , be@@ hold , I will lift up mine hand to the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and set up my standard to the people : and they shall bring TH@@ Y sons in their arms , and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be carried upon their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
and kings shall be TH@@ Y nur@@ sing fa@@ thers , and their que@@ ens TH@@ Y nur@@ sing mothers : they shall bo@@ w down to the@@ e with their face toward the ear@@ th , and lick up the d@@ ust of TH@@ Y feet ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord : for they shall not be as@@ ha@@ med that wait for me .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , W@@ here is the bill of your mother 's div@@ or@@ cement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? be@@ hold , for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have ye sold yo@@ ur@@ selves , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions is your mother put away .
the Lord God hat@@ h given me the ton@@ gue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is we@@ ary : he w@@ aken@@ eth morning by morning , he w@@ aken@@ eth mine e@@ ar to hear as the learned .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be con@@ founded : therefore have I set my face like a F@@ lin@@ t , and I know that I shall not be as@@ ha@@ med .
who is among you that fear@@ eth the Lord , that obe@@ yet@@ h the voice of his ser@@ vant , that walk@@ eth in d@@ ark@@ ness , and hat@@ h no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
Hear@@ ken to me , ye that follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , ye that seek the Lord : look un@@ to the rock wh@@ ence ye are he@@ wn , and to the hol@@ e of the p@@ it wh@@ ence ye are dig@@ ged .
for the Lord shall comfor@@ t Z@@ ion : he will comfor@@ t all her waste places ; and he will make her w@@ il@@ der@@ ness like E@@ den , and her de@@ sert like the gar@@ den of the Lord ; joy and gla@@ d@@ ness shall be found there@@ in , Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of me@@ lo@@ dy .
art th@@ ou not it which hat@@ h dri@@ ed the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hat@@ h made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the ran@@ so@@ med to pass over ?
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hat@@ h brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hat@@ h brought up .
TH@@ Y sons have fa@@ in@@ ted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as a wild bul@@ l in a net : they are full of the fur@@ y of the Lord , the re@@ bu@@ ke of TH@@ Y God .
thus sa@@ ith TH@@ Y Lord the Lord , and TH@@ Y God that ple@@ ade@@ th the cause of his people , be@@ hold , I have taken out of th@@ ine hand the c@@ up of tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , even the d@@ reg@@ s of the c@@ up of my fur@@ y ; th@@ ou s@@ halt no more drink it again :
but I will put it into the hand of them that aff@@ lic@@ t the@@ e ; which have said to TH@@ Y sou@@ l , bo@@ w down , that we may go over : and th@@ ou h@@ ast laid TH@@ Y body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over .
the Lord hat@@ h made b@@ are his hol@@ y arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the ear@@ th shall see the sal@@ vation of our God .
de@@ part ye , de@@ part ye , go ye out from th@@ ence , touch no un@@ clean thing ; go ye out of the mid@@ st of her ; be ye clean , that bear the vessels of the Lord .
for ye shall not go out with has@@ te , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; the kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a d@@ ry ground : he hat@@ h no form nor co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he was op@@ pressed , and he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , yet he opened not his m@@ outh : he is brought as a lam@@ b to the sla@@ ughter , and as a she@@ ep before her s@@ hear@@ ers is dum@@ b , so he open@@ eth not his m@@ outh .
fear not ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be as@@ ha@@ med : neither be th@@ ou con@@ founded ; for th@@ ou s@@ halt not be put to sh@@ ame : for th@@ ou s@@ halt forget the sh@@ ame of TH@@ Y youth , and s@@ halt not remember the re@@ pro@@ ach of TH@@ Y wi@@ do@@ who@@ od any more .
for this is as the waters of No@@ ah un@@ to me : for as I have sworn that the waters of No@@ ah should no more go over the ear@@ th ; so have I sworn that I would not be wro@@ th with the@@ e , nor re@@ bu@@ ke the@@ e .
for the mountains shall de@@ part , and the hil@@ ls be removed ; but my kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from the@@ e , neither shall the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the Lord that hat@@ h mer@@ cy on the@@ e .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satis@@ fi@@ eth not ? he@@ arken dil@@ ig@@ ently un@@ to me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your sou@@ l de@@ light itself in fat@@ ness .
be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt call a nation that th@@ ou know@@ est not , and nations that knew not the@@ e shall run un@@ to the@@ e because of the Lord TH@@ Y God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hat@@ h gl@@ ori@@ fied the@@ e .
let the w@@ ic@@ ked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous man his th@@ ou@@ ghts : and let him return un@@ to the Lord , and he will have mer@@ cy upon him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly par@@ don .
for as the rain co@@ me@@ th down , and the snow from heav@@ en , and retur@@ net@@ h not th@@ ither , but water@@ eth the ear@@ th , and mak@@ eth it bring forth and bu@@ d , that it may give se@@ ed to the so@@ wer , and bread to the e@@ ater :
so shall my word be that go@@ eth forth out of my m@@ outh : it shall not return un@@ to me vo@@ id , but it shall accomp@@ lish that which I ple@@ ase , and it shall prosp@@ er in the thing where@@ to I sent it .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hil@@ ls shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall cla@@ p their hands .
instead of the Th@@ or@@ n shall come up the f@@ ir tree , and instead of the bri@@ er shall come up the m@@ yr@@ tle tree : and it shall be to the Lord for a name , for an ever@@ lasting sign that shall not be cut off .
even them will I bring to my hol@@ y mountain , and make them jo@@ y@@ ful in my house of pray@@ er : their bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es shall be accepted upon mine alt@@ ar ; for mine house shall be called an house of pray@@ er for all people .
Ye@@ a , they are gre@@ edy do@@ gs which can never have enough , and they are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds that can@@ not understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
for thus sa@@ ith the high and lo@@ f@@ ty One that inhabi@@ te@@ th et@@ ern@@ ity , whose name is Holy ; I d@@ well in the high and hol@@ y place , with him also that is of a contr@@ ite and hum@@ ble spirit , to revive the spirit of the hum@@ ble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite ones .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore have we fas@@ ted , say they , and th@@ ou se@@ est not ? where@@ fore have we aff@@ lic@@ ted our sou@@ l , and th@@ ou tak@@ est no knowledge ? be@@ hold , in the day of your fast ye find pleas@@ ure , and exact all your la@@ bour@@ s .
be@@ hold , ye fast for stri@@ fe and debate , and to sm@@ ite with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
is it not to deal TH@@ Y bread to the hun@@ gry , and that th@@ ou bring the poor that are cast out to TH@@ Y house ? when th@@ ou se@@ est the nak@@ ed , that th@@ ou cover him ; and that th@@ ou hide not th@@ y@@ self from th@@ ine own f@@ les@@ h ?
then shall TH@@ Y light break forth as the morning , and th@@ ine health shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y : and TH@@ Y righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before the@@ e ; the gl@@ ory of the Lord shall be TH@@ Y r@@ er@@ e@@ ward .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou call , and the Lord shall answer ; th@@ ou s@@ halt cry , and he shall say , H@@ ere I am . if th@@ ou take away from the mid@@ st of the@@ e the yok@@ e , the putting forth of the fin@@ ger , and speaking van@@ ity ;
and the Lord shall guide the@@ e continu@@ ally , and satisfy TH@@ Y sou@@ l in drought , and make f@@ at TH@@ Y b@@ ones : and th@@ ou s@@ halt be like a wat@@ ered gar@@ den , and like a spring of water , whose waters fail not .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
for he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and an hel@@ met of sal@@ vation upon his head ; and he put on the gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a clo@@ ke .
as for me , this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , sa@@ ith the Lord ; My spirit that is upon the@@ e , and my words which I have put in TH@@ Y m@@ outh , shall not de@@ part out of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , nor out of the m@@ outh of TH@@ Y se@@ ed , nor out of the m@@ outh of TH@@ Y se@@ ed 's se@@ ed , sa@@ ith the Lord , from hen@@ ce@@ forth and for ever .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt see , and flow together , and th@@ ine heart shall fear , and be en@@ lar@@ ged ; because the ab@@ und@@ ance of the sea shall be conver@@ ted un@@ to the@@ e , the forces of the Gen@@ ti@@ les shall come un@@ to the@@ e .
the sons also of them that aff@@ lic@@ ted the@@ e shall come ben@@ ding un@@ to the@@ e ; and all they that desp@@ ised the@@ e shall bo@@ w themselves down at the so@@ les of TH@@ Y feet ; and they shall call the@@ e , The city of the Lord , The Z@@ ion of the Holy One of Israel .
the sun shall be no more TH@@ Y light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light un@@ to the@@ e : but the Lord shall be un@@ to the@@ e an ever@@ lasting light , and TH@@ Y God TH@@ Y gl@@ ory .
TH@@ Y sun shall no more go down ; neither shall TH@@ Y moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be th@@ ine ever@@ lasting light , and the days of TH@@ Y mourning shall be ended .
but ye shall be named the pri@@ ests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the ri@@ ches of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and in their gl@@ ory shall ye bo@@ ast yo@@ ur@@ selves .
for as the ear@@ th br@@ ing@@ eth forth her bu@@ d , and as the gar@@ den ca@@ us@@ eth the things that are so@@ wn in it to spring forth ; so the Lord God will cause righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness there@@ of go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and the sal@@ vation there@@ of as a lam@@ p that bur@@ net@@ h .
the Lord hat@@ h sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , su@@ rely I will no more give TH@@ Y cor@@ n to be meat for th@@ ine enem@@ ies ; and the sons of the st@@ ran@@ ger shall not drink TH@@ Y wine , for the which th@@ ou h@@ ast la@@ b@@ oured :
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I won@@ dered that there was none to up@@ hold : therefore mine own arm brought sal@@ vation un@@ to me ; and my fur@@ y , it up@@ held me .
I will mention the lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ nesses of the Lord , and the pra@@ ises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hat@@ h bes@@ to@@ wed on us , and the great Go@@ od@@ ness toward the house of Israel , which he hat@@ h bes@@ to@@ wed on them according to his mer@@ cies , and according to the multi@@ tude of his lov@@ ing@@ kin@@ d@@ nesses .
in all their aff@@ li@@ ction he was aff@@ lic@@ ted , and the an@@ gel of his presence sav@@ ed them : in his love and in his p@@ ity he re@@ deemed them ; and he b@@ are them , and carried them all the days of old .
but we are all as an un@@ clean thing , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses are as fil@@ thy ra@@ gs ; and we all do fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , have taken us away .
and there is none that cal@@ le@@ th upon TH@@ Y name , that s@@ tir@@ re@@ th up himself to take hold of the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast hi@@ d TH@@ Y face from us , and h@@ ast consu@@ med us , because of our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , be@@ hold me , be@@ hold me , un@@ to a nation that was not called by my name .
and Shar@@ on shall be a fold of f@@ loc@@ ks , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or a place for the her@@ ds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me .
and I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of we@@ eping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of cr@@ ying .
they shall not build , and another in@@ ha@@ bit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
I also will choose their de@@ lu@@ sions , and will bring their fears upon them ; because when I called , none did answer ; when I sp@@ ake , they did not hear : but they did ev@@ il before mine eyes , and chose that in which I deli@@ gh@@ ted not .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the car@@ cases of the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for their wor@@ m shall not die , neither shall their fire be qu@@ en@@ ched ; and they shall be an ab@@ hor@@ ring un@@ to all f@@ les@@ h .
and I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , who have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ pped the works of their own hands .
H@@ ast th@@ ou not proc@@ ured this un@@ to th@@ y@@ self , in that th@@ ou h@@ ast for@@ sak@@ en the Lord TH@@ Y God , when he led the@@ e by the way ?
and now what h@@ ast th@@ ou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of S@@ ih@@ or ? or what h@@ ast th@@ ou to do in the way of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , to drink the waters of the river ?
a wild ass used to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleas@@ ure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not we@@ ary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
but where are TH@@ Y go@@ ds that th@@ ou h@@ ast made the@@ e ? let them arise , if they can save the@@ e in the time of TH@@ Y trouble : for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities are TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h .
and I saw , when for all the causes where@@ by back@@ sli@@ ding Israel committed ad@@ ul@@ tery I had put her away , and given her a bill of div@@ or@@ ce ; yet her t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous sister Ju@@ da@@ h fear@@ ed not , but went and played the har@@ lot also .
at that time they shall call Jer@@ usalem the th@@ r@@ one of the Lord ; and all the nations shall be gathered un@@ to it , to the name of the Lord , to Jer@@ usalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imag@@ ination of their ev@@ il heart .
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inher@@ it@@ ance un@@ to your fa@@ thers .
the lion is come up from his th@@ ic@@ ket , and the destro@@ yer of the Gen@@ ti@@ les is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make TH@@ Y land de@@ so@@ late ; and TH@@ Y cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabi@@ tant .
my bo@@ wel@@ s , my bo@@ wel@@ s ! I am pain@@ ed at my very heart ; my heart mak@@ eth a no@@ ise in me ; I can@@ not hold my peace , because th@@ ou h@@ ast heard , O my sou@@ l , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , the alarm of war .
run ye to and f@@ ro through the streets of Jer@@ usalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places there@@ of , if ye can find a man , if there be any that execu@@ te@@ th judgment , that seek@@ eth the truth ; and I will par@@ don it .
I will get me un@@ to the great men , and will speak un@@ to them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yok@@ e , and bur@@ st the bonds .
how shall I par@@ don the@@ e for this ? TH@@ Y children have for@@ sak@@ en me , and sworn by them that are no go@@ ds : when I had f@@ ed them to the full , they then committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and assemb@@ led themselves by troops in the har@@ lots ' houses .
and they shall eat up th@@ ine har@@ v@@ est , and TH@@ Y bread , which TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters should eat : they shall eat up TH@@ Y f@@ loc@@ ks and th@@ ine her@@ ds : they shall eat up TH@@ Y v@@ ines and TH@@ Y fi@@ g trees : they shall imp@@ over@@ ish TH@@ Y f@@ enced cities , where@@ in th@@ ou tr@@ us@@ ted@@ st , with the s@@ word .
they are wa@@ x@@ en f@@ at , they sh@@ ine : ye@@ a , they over@@ pass the de@@ eds of the w@@ ic@@ ked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fa@@ ther@@ less , yet they prosp@@ er ; and the right of the ne@@ edy do they not judge .
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? be@@ hold , their e@@ ar is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can@@ not he@@ arken : be@@ hold , the word of the Lord is un@@ to them a re@@ pro@@ ach ; they have no de@@ light in it .
for from the least of them even un@@ to the greatest of them every one is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and from the pro@@ phe@@ t even un@@ to the pri@@ est every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
they shall lay hold on bo@@ w and spe@@ ar ; they are cru@@ el , and have no mer@@ cy ; their voice ro@@ aret@@ h like the sea ; and they ride upon hor@@ ses , set in array as men for war against the@@ e , O daughter of Z@@ ion .
and now , because ye have done all these works , sa@@ ith the Lord , and I sp@@ ake un@@ to you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answ@@ ered not ;
the children gather wood , and the fa@@ thers kin@@ dle the fire , and the women k@@ ne@@ ad their d@@ ough , to make cak@@ es to the qu@@ een of heav@@ en , and to p@@ our out drink offer@@ ings un@@ to other go@@ ds , that they may prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
for I sp@@ ake not un@@ to your fa@@ thers , nor comman@@ ded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
but this thing comman@@ ded I them , saying , obe@@ y my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have comman@@ ded you , that it may be well un@@ to you .
since the day that your fa@@ thers came forth out of the land of Egypt un@@ to this day I have even sent un@@ to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , daily rising up early and sending them :
therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt speak all these words un@@ to them ; but they will not he@@ arken to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt also call un@@ to them ; but they will not answer the@@ e .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Top@@ he@@ t , nor the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , but the val@@ ley of sla@@ ughter : for they shall bur@@ y in Top@@ he@@ t , ti@@ ll there be no place .
then will I cause to ce@@ ase from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the streets of Jer@@ usalem , the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de : for the land shall be de@@ so@@ late .
at that time , sa@@ ith the Lord , they shall bring out the b@@ ones of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the b@@ ones of his pr@@ inces , and the b@@ ones of the pri@@ ests , and the b@@ ones of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the b@@ ones of the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , out of their graves :
Ye@@ a , the stor@@ k in the heav@@ en know@@ eth her appointed times ; and the tur@@ tle and the cr@@ ane and the sw@@ allow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
therefore will I give their wi@@ ves un@@ to others , and their fields to them that shall inher@@ it them : for every one from the least even un@@ to the greatest is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness , from the pro@@ phe@@ t even un@@ to the pri@@ est every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our pal@@ aces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the people are v@@ ain : for one cut@@ te@@ th a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man , with the ax@@ e .
they are u@@ pri@@ ght as the pal@@ m tree , but speak not : they must needs be bor@@ ne , because they can@@ not go . be not afraid of them ; for they can@@ not do ev@@ il , neither also is it in them to do good .
who would not fear the@@ e , O King of nations ? for to the@@ e do@@ th it ap@@ per@@ tain : for@@ as@@ much as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , there is none like un@@ to the@@ e .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from U@@ p@@ haz , the work of the work@@ man , and of the hands of the founder : blue and pur@@ ple is their clo@@ thing : they are all the work of c@@ un@@ ning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an ever@@ lasting king : at his wr@@ ath the ear@@ th shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his in@@ dign@@ ation .
when he ut@@ ter@@ eth his voice , there is a multi@@ tude of waters in the heav@@ ens , and he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th ; he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings with rain , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth the wind out of his treasures .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is sp@@ o@@ iled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
p@@ our out TH@@ Y fur@@ y upon the he@@ a@@ then that know the@@ e not , and upon the families that call not on TH@@ Y name : for they have e@@ aten up Jac@@ o@@ b , and dev@@ oured him , and consu@@ med him , and have made his habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late .
for I ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly protested un@@ to your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even un@@ to this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obe@@ y my voice .
they are turned back to the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fa@@ thers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other go@@ ds to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I made with their fa@@ thers .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord , be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry un@@ to me , I will not he@@ arken un@@ to them .
for according to the number of TH@@ Y cities were TH@@ Y go@@ ds , O Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have ye set up al@@ tar@@ s to that sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se un@@ to Ba@@ al .
the Lord called TH@@ Y name , A green olive tree , fair , and of good@@ ly fruit : with the no@@ ise of a great t@@ um@@ ult he hat@@ h kin@@ d@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for the Lord of hosts , that plan@@ ted the@@ e , hat@@ h pronounced ev@@ il against the@@ e , for the ev@@ il of the house of Israel and of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , which they have done against themselves to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger in offering incen@@ se un@@ to Ba@@ al .
for even TH@@ Y bre@@ th@@ ren , and the house of TH@@ Y father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with the@@ e ; ye@@ a , they have called a multi@@ tude after the@@ e : believe them not , though they speak fair words un@@ to the@@ e .
the sp@@ o@@ ilers are come upon all high places through the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : for the s@@ word of the Lord shall dev@@ our from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h shall have peace .
they have so@@ wn wheat , but shall re@@ ap thor@@ ns : they have put themselves to p@@ ain , but shall not profit : and they shall be as@@ ha@@ med of your revenues because of the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord against all mine ev@@ il neighbours , that touch the inher@@ it@@ ance which I have caused my people Israel to inher@@ it ; be@@ hold , I will p@@ lu@@ ck them out of their land , and p@@ lu@@ ck out the house of Ju@@ da@@ h from among them .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them out I will return , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
then I went to E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and dig@@ ged , and took the gir@@ dle from the place where I had hi@@ d it : and , be@@ hold , the gir@@ dle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
this ev@@ il people , which refuse to hear my words , which walk in the imag@@ ination of their heart , and walk after other go@@ ds , to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this gir@@ dle , which is good for nothing .
give gl@@ ory to the Lord your God , before he cause d@@ ark@@ ness , and before your feet st@@ um@@ ble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross d@@ ark@@ ness .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Ju@@ da@@ h shall be carried away cap@@ tive all of it , it shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
and their no@@ bles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the p@@ its , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were as@@ ha@@ med and con@@ founded , and covered their heads .
O the hope of Israel , the sa@@ vi@@ our there@@ of in time of trouble , why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou be as a st@@ ran@@ ger in the land , and as a w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man that tur@@ net@@ h aside to tar@@ ry for a night ?
why sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou be as a man ast@@ on@@ ied , as a m@@ igh@@ ty man that can@@ not save ? yet th@@ ou , O Lord , art in the mid@@ st of us , and we are called by TH@@ Y name ; leave us not .
and the people to whom they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y shall be cast out in the streets of Jer@@ usalem because of the fam@@ ine and the s@@ word ; and they shall have none to bur@@ y them , them , their wi@@ ves , nor their sons , nor their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters : for I will p@@ our their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess upon them .
H@@ ast th@@ ou ut@@ ter@@ ly rejected Ju@@ da@@ h ? hat@@ h TH@@ Y sou@@ l lo@@ th@@ ed Z@@ ion ? why h@@ ast th@@ ou s@@ mit@@ ten us , and there is no he@@ aling for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of he@@ aling , and be@@ hold trouble !
and I will cause them to be removed into all k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , for that which he did in Jer@@ usalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas : I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a sp@@ o@@ iler at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused him to fall upon it su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , and terr@@ ors upon the city .
and I will make the@@ e un@@ to this people a f@@ enced br@@ as@@ en wall : and they shall fight against the@@ e , but they shall not prev@@ ail against the@@ e : for I am with the@@ e to save the@@ e and to deliver the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that b@@ are them , and concerning their fa@@ thers that beg@@ at them in this land ;
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning , to comfor@@ t them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the c@@ up of con@@ so@@ lation to drink for their father or for their mother .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; be@@ hold , I will cause to ce@@ ase out of this place in your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de .
and it shall come to pass , when th@@ ou s@@ halt she@@ w this people all these words , and they shall say un@@ to the@@ e , W@@ her@@ e@@ fore hat@@ h the Lord pronounced all this great ev@@ il against us ? or what is our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ?
and ye have done worse than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , ye walk every one after the imag@@ ination of his ev@@ il heart , that they may not he@@ arken un@@ to me :
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is Gra@@ ven upon the table of their heart , and upon the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
and th@@ ou , even th@@ y@@ self , s@@ halt dis@@ continue from th@@ ine heritage that I gave the@@ e ; and I will cause the@@ e to serve th@@ ine enem@@ ies in the land which th@@ ou know@@ est not : for ye have kin@@ d@@ led a fire in mine an@@ ger , which shall bur@@ n for ever .
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good co@@ me@@ th ; but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ te@@ th on eg@@ gs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ te@@ th ri@@ ches , and not by right , shall leave them in the mid@@ st of his days , and at his end shall be a fo@@ ol .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that for@@ sake the@@ e shall be as@@ ha@@ med , and they that de@@ part from me shall be written in the ear@@ th , because they have for@@ sak@@ en the Lord , the fo@@ un@@ tain of living waters .
thus said the Lord un@@ to me ; G@@ o and stand in the gate of the children of the people , where@@ by the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h come in , and by the which they go out , and in all the gates of Jer@@ usalem ;
and it shall come to pass , if ye dil@@ ig@@ ently he@@ arken un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , but hal@@ low the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , to do no work there@@ in ;
and they shall come from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and from the places about Jer@@ usalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the pla@@ in , and from the mountains , and from the south , bringing bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , and meat offer@@ ings , and incen@@ se , and bringing sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of praise , un@@ to the house of the Lord .
and the ves@@ sel that he made of cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter : so he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do un@@ to them .
therefore deliver up their children to the fam@@ ine , and p@@ our out their blood by the force of the s@@ word ; and let their wi@@ ves be ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of their children , and be wi@@ dows ; and let their men be put to death ; let their young men be sla@@ in by the s@@ word in battle .
and go forth un@@ to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the east gate , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell the@@ e ,
and I will make vo@@ id the coun@@ sel of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the s@@ word before their enem@@ ies , and by the hands of them that seek their lives : and their car@@ cases will I give to be meat for the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and for the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and I will cause them to eat the f@@ les@@ h of their sons and the f@@ les@@ h of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and they shall eat every one the f@@ les@@ h of his friend in the siege and stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with their enem@@ ies , and they that seek their lives , shall stra@@ i@@ ten them .
and the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall be def@@ iled as the place of Top@@ he@@ t , because of all the houses upon whose ro@@ of@@ s they have burned incen@@ se un@@ to all the host of heav@@ en , and have p@@ oured out drink offer@@ ings un@@ to other go@@ ds .
then P@@ ash@@ ur smo@@ te Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the la@@ bour@@ s there@@ of , and all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things there@@ of , and all the treasures of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , which shall sp@@ oil them , and take them , and carry them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
inqu@@ ire , I pra@@ y the@@ e , of the Lord for us ; for Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on mak@@ eth war against us ; if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all his won@@ dro@@ us works , that he may go up from us .
he that abi@@ de@@ th in this city shall die by the s@@ word , and by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : but he that go@@ eth out , and fal@@ le@@ th to the Chal@@ de@@ ans that bes@@ i@@ ege you , he shall live , and his life shall be un@@ to him for a pre@@ y .
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your do@@ ings , sa@@ ith the Lord : and I will kin@@ dle a fire in the forest there@@ of , and it shall dev@@ our all things round about it .
and say , He@@ ar the word of the Lord , O king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sit@@ test upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , th@@ ou , and TH@@ Y servants , and TH@@ Y people that enter in by these gates :
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , ri@@ ding in char@@ i@@ ots and on hor@@ ses , he , and his servants , and his people .
and I will give the@@ e into the hand of them that seek TH@@ Y life , and into the hand of them whose face th@@ ou fear@@ est , even into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
and I will cast the@@ e out , and TH@@ Y mother that b@@ are the@@ e , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken i@@ dol ? is he a ves@@ sel where@@ in is no pleas@@ ure ? where@@ fore are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all countries w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and increase .
for the land is full of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of swe@@ aring the land mour@@ net@@ h ; the pleas@@ ant places of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness are dri@@ ed up , and their course is ev@@ il , and their force is not right .
the an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and ti@@ ll he have performed the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
but if they had stood in my coun@@ sel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their ev@@ il way , and from the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
but since ye say , The burden of the Lord ; therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; Bec@@ ause ye say this word , The burden of the Lord , and I have sent un@@ to you , saying , Y@@ e shall not say , The burden of the Lord ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I , even I , will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will for@@ sake you , and the city that I gave you and your fa@@ thers , and cast you out of my presence :
one bas@@ ket had very good fig@@ s , even like the fig@@ s that are first ri@@ pe : and the other bas@@ ket had very na@@ ug@@ h@@ ty fig@@ s , which could not be e@@ aten , they were so bad .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; L@@ ike these good fig@@ s , so will I acknowledge them that are carried away cap@@ tive of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans for their good .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not p@@ lu@@ ck them up .
and I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the Lord : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return un@@ to me with their whole heart .
and I will deliver them to be removed into all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th for their hurt , to be a re@@ pro@@ ach and a pro@@ ver@@ b , a ta@@ un@@ t and a cur@@ se , in all places w@@ hi@@ ther I shall drive them .
from the thir@@ teen@@ th year of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Ju@@ da@@ h , even un@@ to this day , that is the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , the word of the Lord hat@@ h come un@@ to me , and I have spoken un@@ to you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed .
and the Lord hat@@ h sent un@@ to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mir@@ th , and the voice of gla@@ d@@ ness , the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om , and the voice of the bri@@ de , the sound of the mil@@ l@@ stones , and the light of the cand@@ le .
and it shall come to pass , when sev@@ enty years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and that nation , sa@@ ith the Lord , for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and will make it perpet@@ ual de@@ so@@ lations .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jerem@@ i@@ ah hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against all the nations .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God of Israel un@@ to me ; T@@ ake the wine c@@ up of this fur@@ y at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send the@@ e , to drink it .
then took I the c@@ up at the Lord 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , un@@ to whom the Lord had sent me :
to w@@ it , Jer@@ usalem , and the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the kings there@@ of , and the pr@@ inces there@@ of , to make them a de@@ so@@ lation , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , an his@@ sing , and a cur@@ se ; as it is this day ;
and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Az@@ z@@ ah , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are upon the face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
a no@@ ise shall come even to the ends of the ear@@ th ; for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with the nations , he will p@@ lead with all f@@ les@@ h ; he will give them that are w@@ ic@@ ked to the s@@ word , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and the sla@@ in of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the ear@@ th even un@@ to the other end of the ear@@ th : they shall not be lamen@@ ted , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be D@@ ung upon the ground .
a voice of the cry of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and an ho@@ w@@ ling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled their pas@@ ture .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; St@@ and in the court of the Lord 's house , and speak un@@ to all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , which come to worship in the Lord 's house , all the words that I command the@@ e to speak un@@ to them ; dimin@@ ish not a word :
if so be they will he@@ arken , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way , that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il , which I purpose to do un@@ to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
to he@@ arken to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I sent un@@ to you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hear@@ ken@@ ed ;
now it came to pass , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had comman@@ ded him to speak un@@ to all the people , that the pri@@ ests and the pro@@ ph@@ ets and all the people took him , saying , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt su@@ rely die .
when the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house un@@ to the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his m@@ igh@@ ty men , and all the pr@@ inces , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and they f@@ et@@ ched forth U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him un@@ to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king ; who sle@@ w him with the s@@ word , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ a@@ b , and to the king of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and to the king of T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , and to the king of Z@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers which come to Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
I have made the ear@@ th , the man and the be@@ ast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and have given it un@@ to whom it seemed meet un@@ to me .
and now have I given all these lands un@@ to the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the be@@ asts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
therefore he@@ arken not ye to your pro@@ ph@@ ets , nor to your di@@ vin@@ ers , nor to your dre@@ am@@ ers , nor to your en@@ chan@@ ters , nor to your sor@@ cer@@ ers , which speak un@@ to you , saying , Y@@ e shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on :
Ye@@ a , thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Ju@@ da@@ h and of Jer@@ usalem ;
and it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Az@@ ur the pro@@ phe@@ t , which was of Gi@@ be@@ on , sp@@ ake un@@ to me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the pri@@ ests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried them to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
and I will bring again to this place J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h , with all the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , that went into Bab@@ yl@@ on , sa@@ ith the Lord : for I will break the yok@@ e of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to the pro@@ phe@@ t Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah in the presence of the pri@@ ests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord ,
then the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the yok@@ e from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , un@@ to all that are carried away cap@@ tives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jer@@ usalem un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
take ye wi@@ ves , and be@@ get sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and take wi@@ ves for your sons , and give your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to hus@@ bands , that they may bear sons and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; that ye may be increased there , and not dimin@@ ished .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Let not your pro@@ ph@@ ets and your di@@ vin@@ ers , that be in the mid@@ st of you , dec@@ e@@ ive you , neither he@@ arken to your dre@@ ams which ye cause to be dre@@ amed .
know that thus sa@@ ith the Lord of the king that sit@@ te@@ th upon the th@@ r@@ one of David , and of all the people that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in this city , and of your bre@@ th@@ ren that are not gone forth with you into cap@@ tivity ;
because they have committed vil@@ lan@@ y in Israel , and have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with their neighbours ' wi@@ ves , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not comman@@ ded them ; even I know , and am a witness , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Bec@@ ause th@@ ou h@@ ast sent letters in TH@@ Y name un@@ to all the people that are at Jer@@ usalem , and to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and to all the pri@@ ests , saying ,
the Lord hat@@ h made the@@ e pri@@ est in the stead of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is ma@@ d , and mak@@ eth himself a pro@@ phe@@ t , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest put him in prison , and in the sto@@ cks .
send to all them of the cap@@ tivity , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord concerning Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the Ne@@ he@@ lam@@ ite ; Bec@@ ause that Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied un@@ to you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
all TH@@ Y lov@@ ers have forgotten the@@ e ; they seek the@@ e not ; for I have wounded the@@ e with the wo@@ und of an enemy , with the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of a cru@@ el one , for the multi@@ tude of th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; because TH@@ Y sin@@ s were increased .
therefore all they that dev@@ our the@@ e shall be dev@@ oured ; and all th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries , every one of them , shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and they that sp@@ oil the@@ e shall be a sp@@ oil , and all that pre@@ y upon the@@ e will I give for a pre@@ y .
for I will restore health un@@ to the@@ e , and I will he@@ al the@@ e of TH@@ Y wounds , sa@@ ith the Lord ; because they called the@@ e an out@@ cast , saying , This is Z@@ ion , whom no man seek@@ eth after .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b 's ten@@ ts , and have mer@@ cy on his d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places ; and the city shall be buil@@ ded upon her own he@@ ap , and the palace shall remain after the manner there@@ of .
and out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of them that make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
the fierce an@@ ger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
again I will build the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be built , O vir@@ gin of Israel : th@@ ou s@@ halt again be ad@@ or@@ ned with TH@@ Y tab@@ re@@ ts , and s@@ halt go forth in the dan@@ ces of them that make mer@@ ry .
I have su@@ rely heard E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im b@@ emo@@ an@@ ing himself thus ; T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed me , and I was ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed , as a bul@@ lock un@@ acc@@ ust@@ o@@ med to the yok@@ e : turn th@@ ou me , and I shall be turned ; for th@@ ou art the Lord my God .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I smo@@ te upon my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , ye@@ a , even con@@ founded , because I did bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of be@@ ast .
and it shall come to pass , that like as I have watched over them , to p@@ lu@@ ck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to aff@@ lic@@ t ; so will I watch over them , to build , and to plant , sa@@ ith the Lord .
not according to the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I made with their fa@@ thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant they br@@ ake , although I was an husband un@@ to them , sa@@ ith the Lord :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; If heav@@ en above can be meas@@ ured , and the foundations of the ear@@ th searched out ben@@ e@@ ath , I will also cast off all the se@@ ed of Israel for all that they have done , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed Jer@@ usalem : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Ju@@ da@@ h 's house .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall su@@ rely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and shall speak with him m@@ outh to m@@ outh , and his eyes shall be@@ hold his eyes ;
thus sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; T@@ ake these evi@@ den@@ ces , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an ear@@ then ves@@ sel , that they may continue many days .
great in coun@@ sel , and m@@ igh@@ ty in work : for th@@ ine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
and h@@ ast brought forth TH@@ Y people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with great terror ;
and they came in , and poss@@ essed it ; but they obe@@ yed not TH@@ Y voice , neither walked in TH@@ Y law ; they have done nothing of all that th@@ ou comman@@ de@@ d@@ st them to do : therefore th@@ ou h@@ ast caused all this ev@@ il to come upon them :
for the children of Israel and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have only done ev@@ il before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to an@@ ger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the Lord .
for this city hat@@ h been to me as a provoc@@ ation of mine an@@ ger and of my fur@@ y from the day that they built it even un@@ to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
and they have turned un@@ to me the back , and not the face : though I ta@@ ught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hear@@ ken@@ ed to receive in@@ struction .
be@@ hold , I will gather them out of all countries , w@@ hi@@ ther I have driven them in mine an@@ ger , and in my fur@@ y , and in great wr@@ ath ; and I will bring them again un@@ to this place , and I will cause them to d@@ well saf@@ ely :
and I will make an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hear@@ ts , that they shall not de@@ part from me .
moreover the word of the Lord came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which are thrown down by the moun@@ ts , and by the s@@ word ;
and I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , where@@ by they have sin@@ ned , and where@@ by they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
in the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the val@@ e , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jer@@ usalem , and in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , shall the f@@ loc@@ ks pass again under the hands of him that tel@@ le@@ th them , sa@@ ith the Lord .
Con@@ si@@ der@@ est th@@ ou not what this people have spoken , saying , The two families which the Lord hat@@ h chosen , he hat@@ h even cast them off ? thus they have desp@@ ised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word which came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and all his army , and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the ear@@ th of his domin@@ ion , and all the people , fought against Jer@@ usalem , and against all the cities there@@ of , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; G@@ o and speak to Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and tell him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall bur@@ n it with fire :
this is the word that came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people which were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty un@@ to them ;
that every man should let his man@@ ser@@ vant , and every man his ma@@ id@@ ser@@ vant , being an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w or an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to w@@ it , of a J@@ ew his brother .
but after@@ ward they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; I made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ d@@ men , saying ,
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , which hat@@ h been sold un@@ to the@@ e ; and when he hat@@ h served the@@ e six years , th@@ ou s@@ halt let him go free from the@@ e : but your fa@@ thers hear@@ ken@@ ed not un@@ to me , neither inc@@ lined their e@@ ar .
but ye turned and pollu@@ ted my name , and caused every man his ser@@ vant , and every man his hand@@ ma@@ id , whom ye had set at liber@@ ty at their pleas@@ ure , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection , to be un@@ to you for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat un@@ to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en , and to the be@@ asts of the ear@@ th .
and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h and his pr@@ inces will I give into the hand of their enem@@ ies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's army , which are gone up from you .
go un@@ to the house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes , and speak un@@ to them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the ch@@ ambers , and give them wine to drink .
thus have we obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b our father in all that he hat@@ h charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , nor our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
but it came to pass , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came up into the land , that we said , C@@ ome , and let us go to Jer@@ usalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syri@@ ans : so we d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that this word came un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , saying ,
take the@@ e a rol@@ l of a book , and write there@@ in all the words that I have spoken un@@ to the@@ e against Israel , and against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against all the nations , from the day I sp@@ ake un@@ to the@@ e , from the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah , even un@@ to this day .
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do un@@ to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah : and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken un@@ to him , upon a rol@@ l of a book .
therefore go th@@ ou , and read in the rol@@ l , which th@@ ou h@@ ast written from my m@@ outh , the words of the Lord in the e@@ ars of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fas@@ ting day : and also th@@ ou s@@ halt read them in the e@@ ars of all Ju@@ da@@ h that come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supp@@ lic@@ ation before the Lord , and will return every one from his ev@@ il way : for great is the an@@ ger and the fur@@ y that the Lord hat@@ h pronounced against this people .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jer@@ usalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h un@@ to Jer@@ usalem .
then read Bar@@ u@@ ch in the book the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house , in the e@@ ars of all the people .
then he went down into the king 's house , into the s@@ cri@@ be 's chamber : and , lo , all the pr@@ inces sat there , even E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , and El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and all the pr@@ inces .
therefore all the pr@@ inces sent J@@ eh@@ udi the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , the son of C@@ us@@ hi , un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch , saying , T@@ ake in th@@ ine hand the rol@@ l where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast read in the e@@ ars of the people , and come . so Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah took the rol@@ l in his hand , and came un@@ to them .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the rol@@ l in the chamber of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be , and told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
so the king sent J@@ eh@@ udi to f@@ et@@ ch the rol@@ l : and he took it out of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be 's chamber . and J@@ eh@@ udi read it in the e@@ ars of the king , and in the e@@ ars of all the pr@@ inces which stood bes@@ ide the king .
then the word of the Lord came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the rol@@ l , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; He shall have none to sit upon the th@@ r@@ one of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the F@@ ro@@ st .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did he@@ arken un@@ to the words of the Lord , which he sp@@ ake by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that sent you un@@ to me to inqu@@ ire of me ; be@@ hold , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
for though ye had s@@ mit@@ ten the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jer@@ usalem for fear of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army ,
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore the pr@@ inces were wro@@ th with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be : for they had made that the prison .
therefore hear now , I pra@@ y the@@ e , O my lor@@ d the king : let my supp@@ lic@@ ation , I pra@@ y the@@ e , be accepted before the@@ e ; that th@@ ou cause me not to return to the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be , lest I die there .
then She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Mat@@ tan , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of P@@ ash@@ ur , and Ju@@ cal the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and P@@ ash@@ ur the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah , heard the words that Jerem@@ i@@ ah had spoken un@@ to all the people , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord , He that remain@@ eth in this city shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : but he that go@@ eth forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a pre@@ y , and shall live .
then took they Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and cast him into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on of Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Ham@@ me@@ le@@ ch , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds . and in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on there was no water , but m@@ ire : so Jerem@@ i@@ ah sun@@ k in the m@@ ire .
now when E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian , one of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jerem@@ i@@ ah in the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
my lor@@ d the king , these men have done ev@@ il in all that they have done to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , whom they have cast into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
so E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ me@@ le@@ ch took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treas@@ ury , and took th@@ ence old cast cl@@ outs and old rot@@ ten ra@@ gs , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on to Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and the king said un@@ to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , I will ask the@@ e a thing ; hide nothing from me .
but if th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t not go forth to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's pr@@ inces , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall bur@@ n it with fire , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not escape out of their hand .
but Jerem@@ i@@ ah said , They shall not deliver the@@ e . obe@@ y , I bes@@ e@@ ech the@@ e , the voice of the Lord , which I speak un@@ to the@@ e : so it shall be well un@@ to the@@ e , and TH@@ Y sou@@ l shall live .
so they shall bring out all TH@@ Y wi@@ ves and TH@@ Y children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not escape out of their hand , but s@@ halt be taken by the hand of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and th@@ ou s@@ halt cause this city to be burned with fire .
but if the pr@@ inces hear that I have talked with the@@ e , and they come un@@ to the@@ e , and say un@@ to the@@ e , declare un@@ to us now what th@@ ou h@@ ast said un@@ to the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put the@@ e to death ; also what the king said un@@ to the@@ e :
and it came to pass , that when Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king of Ju@@ da@@ h saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's gar@@ den , by the gate bet@@ wi@@ xt the two walls : and he went out the way of the pla@@ in .
but the Chal@@ de@@ ans ' army pursu@@ ed after them , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
but Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
even they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
but I will deliver the@@ e in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord : and th@@ ou s@@ halt not be given into the hand of the men of whom th@@ ou art afraid .
for I will su@@ rely deliver the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not fall by the s@@ word , but TH@@ Y life shall be for a pre@@ y un@@ to the@@ e : because th@@ ou h@@ ast put TH@@ Y trust in me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from the Lord , after that Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in cha@@ ins among all that were carried away cap@@ tive of Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , which were carried away cap@@ tive un@@ to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
now when all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am governor in the land , and had committed un@@ to him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away cap@@ tive to Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
then they came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , even I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and Johan@@ an and Jon@@ athan the sons of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and Ser@@ ai@@ ah the son of Tan@@ hu@@ me@@ th , and the sons of Ep@@ hai the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of a Ma@@ ac@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , they and their men .
as for me , be@@ hold , I will d@@ well at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans , which will come un@@ to us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fru@@ its , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and d@@ well in your cities that ye have taken .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Mo@@ a@@ b , and among the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and in E@@ dom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had left a re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama , of the se@@ ed royal , and the pr@@ inces of the king , even ten men with him , came un@@ to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ; and there they did eat bread together in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
then ar@@ ose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and the ten men that were with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the s@@ word , and sle@@ w him , whom the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had made governor over the land .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also sle@@ w all the Jews that were with him , even with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were found there , and the men of war .
and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said un@@ to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
and it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah sle@@ w them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t said un@@ to them , I have heard you ; be@@ hold , I will pra@@ y un@@ to the Lord your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it un@@ to you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
whether it be good , or whether it be ev@@ il , we will obe@@ y the voice of the Lord our God , to whom we send the@@ e ; that it may be well with us , when we obe@@ y the voice of the Lord our God .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not p@@ lu@@ ck you up : for I rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il that I have done un@@ to you .
be not afraid of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , sa@@ ith the Lord : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
and now therefore hear the word of the Lord , ye re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wh@@ ol@@ ly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to so@@ jour@@ n there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the s@@ word , which ye fear@@ ed , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt , and the fam@@ ine , where@@ of ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there ; they shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce : and none of them shall remain or escape from the ev@@ il that I will bring upon them .
for ye dis@@ sem@@ b@@ led in your hear@@ ts , when ye sent me un@@ to the Lord your God , saying , pra@@ y for us un@@ to the Lord our God ; and according un@@ to all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare un@@ to us , and we will do it .
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hat@@ h sent me un@@ to you .
and it came to pass , that when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking un@@ to all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah set@@ te@@ th the@@ e on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , that were returned from all nations , w@@ hi@@ ther they had been driven , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obe@@ yed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in th@@ ine hand , and hide them in the cla@@ y in the bri@@ ck@@ kil@@ n , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and when he co@@ me@@ th , he shall sm@@ ite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity ; and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the Jews which d@@ well in the land of Egypt , which d@@ well at Mig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at N@@ op@@ h , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
have ye forgotten the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your fa@@ thers , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their wi@@ ves , and your own w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , and the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of your wi@@ ves , which they have committed in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the streets of Jer@@ usalem ?
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even un@@ to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish them that d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce :
then all the men which knew that their wi@@ ves had burned incen@@ se un@@ to other go@@ ds , and all the women that stood by , a great multi@@ tude , even all the people that d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Egypt , in P@@ ath@@ ros , answ@@ ered Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
as for the word that th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken un@@ to us in the name of the Lord , we will not he@@ arken un@@ to the@@ e .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said un@@ to all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
so that the Lord could no longer bear , because of the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings , and because of the ab@@ omin@@ ations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a de@@ so@@ lation , and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and a cur@@ se , without an inhabi@@ tant , as at this day .
be@@ hold , I will watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good : and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h that are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until there be an end of them .
the word that Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t sp@@ ake un@@ to Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah , when he had written these words in a book at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
against Egypt , against the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
come up , ye hor@@ ses ; and ra@@ ge , ye char@@ i@@ ots ; and let the m@@ igh@@ ty men come forth ; the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians and the Lib@@ y@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ di@@ ans , that handle and b@@ end the bo@@ w .
he made many to fall , ye@@ a , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nati@@ vity , from the op@@ pressing s@@ word .
also her hired men are in the mid@@ st of her like fat@@ ted bul@@ loc@@ ks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity was come upon them , and the time of their vis@@ itation .
the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith ; be@@ hold , I will punish the multi@@ tude of No , and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and Egypt , with their go@@ ds , and their kings ; even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and into the hand of his servants : and after@@ ward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , sa@@ ith the Lord .
but fear not th@@ ou , O my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b , and be not dis@@ may@@ ed , O Israel : for , be@@ hold , I will save the@@ e from af@@ ar off , and TH@@ Y se@@ ed from the land of their cap@@ tivity ; and Jac@@ o@@ b shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
at the no@@ ise of the st@@ amp@@ ing of the ho@@ of@@ s of his strong hor@@ ses , at the rus@@ hing of his char@@ i@@ ots , and at the r@@ umb@@ ling of his whe@@ els , the fa@@ thers shall not look back to their children for fe@@ eb@@ len@@ ess of hands ;
Mo@@ a@@ b hat@@ h been at ease from his youth , and he hat@@ h settled on his le@@ es , and hat@@ h not been emp@@ tied from ves@@ sel to ves@@ sel , neither hat@@ h he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his tas@@ te remained in him , and his s@@ cent is not changed .
O v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h , I will we@@ ep for the@@ e with the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er : TH@@ Y plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jaz@@ er : the sp@@ o@@ iler is fallen upon TH@@ Y summer fru@@ its and upon TH@@ Y vin@@ t@@ age .
from the cry of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon even un@@ to Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , and even un@@ to Ja@@ haz , have they ut@@ tered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even un@@ to Hor@@ on@@ aim , as an he@@ if@@ er of three years old : for the waters also of N@@ im@@ rim shall be de@@ so@@ late .
he that fle@@ eth from the fear shall fall into the p@@ it ; and he that get@@ te@@ th up out of the p@@ it shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring upon it , even upon Mo@@ a@@ b , the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the Lord .
they that fled stood under the shadow of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and a fla@@ me from the mid@@ st of S@@ ih@@ on , and shall dev@@ our the cor@@ ner of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the cro@@ wn of the head of the t@@ um@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ones .
be@@ hold , I will bring a fear upon the@@ e , sa@@ ith the Lord God of hosts , from all those that be about the@@ e ; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth ; and none shall gather up him that w@@ ander@@ eth .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is sp@@ o@@ iled , and his bre@@ th@@ ren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; be@@ hold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the c@@ up have assu@@ red@@ ly dr@@ un@@ ken ; and art th@@ ou he that shall altogether go un@@ punished ? th@@ ou s@@ halt not go un@@ punished , but th@@ ou s@@ halt su@@ rely drink of it .
therefore hear the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that he hat@@ h taken against E@@ dom ; and his purposes , that he hat@@ h pur@@ posed against the inhabitants of Tem@@ an : su@@ rely the least of the flock shall draw them out : su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tations de@@ so@@ late with them .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread his w@@ ings over Boz@@ ra@@ h : and at that day shall the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
and their ca@@ me@@ ls shall be a bo@@ o@@ ty , and the multi@@ tude of their c@@ attle a sp@@ oil : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter into all winds them that are in the ut@@ most cor@@ ners ; and I will bring their cal@@ am@@ ity from all sides there@@ of , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and upon E@@ lam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heav@@ en , and will sc@@ at@@ ter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation w@@ hi@@ ther the out@@ casts of E@@ lam shall not come .
for out of the north there co@@ me@@ th up a nation against her , which shall make her land de@@ so@@ late , and none shall d@@ well there@@ in : they shall remove , they shall de@@ part , both man and be@@ ast .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him that hand@@ le@@ th the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the Lord , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sin@@ s of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall not be found : for I will par@@ don them whom I reserve .
I have laid a sn@@ are for the@@ e , and th@@ ou art also taken , O Bab@@ yl@@ on , and th@@ ou w@@ ast not aware : th@@ ou art found , and also caught , because th@@ ou h@@ ast stri@@ ven against the Lord .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
a s@@ word is upon their hor@@ ses , and upon their char@@ i@@ ots , and upon all the min@@ g@@ led people that are in the mid@@ st of her ; and they shall become as women : a s@@ word is upon her treasures ; and they shall be ro@@ bbed .
therefore the wild be@@ asts of the de@@ sert with the wild be@@ asts of the islands shall d@@ well there , and the ow@@ ls shall d@@ well there@@ in : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be d@@ wel@@ t in from generation to generation .
therefore hear ye the coun@@ sel of the Lord , that he hat@@ h taken against Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and his purposes , that he hat@@ h pur@@ posed against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : su@@ rely the least of the flock shall draw them out : su@@ rely he shall make their habi@@ tation de@@ so@@ late with them .
against him that ben@@ de@@ th let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him that lif@@ te@@ th himself up in his bri@@ g@@ and@@ ine : and spar@@ e ye not her young men ; destroy ye ut@@ ter@@ ly all her host .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and deliver every man his sou@@ l : be not cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der un@@ to her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
we would have he@@ aled Bab@@ yl@@ on , but she is not he@@ aled : for@@ sake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reac@@ het@@ h un@@ to heav@@ en , and is lifted up even to the sk@@ ies .
make bright the ar@@ ro@@ ws ; gather the shi@@ elds : the Lord hat@@ h raised up the spirit of the kings of the Me@@ des : for his device is against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to destroy it ; because it is the ven@@ ge@@ ance of the Lord , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
when he ut@@ ter@@ eth his voice , there is a multi@@ tude of waters in the heav@@ ens ; and he ca@@ us@@ eth the v@@ ap@@ ours to as@@ cen@@ d from the ends of the ear@@ th : he mak@@ eth ligh@@ t@@ nings with rain , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth the wind out of his treasures .
and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the char@@ i@@ ot and his Ri@@ der ;
with the@@ e also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces old and young ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the young man and the ma@@ id ;
I will also break in pieces with the@@ e the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and his flock ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces the hus@@ b@@ and@@ man and his yok@@ e of ox@@ en ; and with the@@ e will I break in pieces cap@@ tains and rul@@ ers .
and the land shall tre@@ m@@ ble and sor@@ row : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Bab@@ yl@@ on , to make the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation without an inhabi@@ tant .
and I will punish B@@ el in Bab@@ yl@@ on , and I will bring forth out of his m@@ outh that which he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more un@@ to him : ye@@ a , the wall of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall fall .
therefore , be@@ hold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Gra@@ ven images of Bab@@ yl@@ on : and her whole land shall be con@@ founded , and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
then s@@ halt th@@ ou say , O Lord , th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor be@@ ast , but that it shall be de@@ so@@ late for ever .
and it shall be , when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of reading this book , that th@@ ou s@@ halt bin@@ d a stone to it , and cast it into the mid@@ st of E@@ up@@ h@@ rates :
for through the an@@ ger of the Lord it came to pass in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , ti@@ ll he had cast them out from his presence , that Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on came , he and all his army , against Jer@@ usalem , and pit@@ ched against it , and built for@@ ts against it round about .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was sor@@ e in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
then he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in cha@@ ins , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison ti@@ ll the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the n@@ in@@ ete@@ en@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , came Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , into Jer@@ usalem ,
and burned the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , and all the houses of the great men , burned he with fire :
then Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive certain of the poor of the people , and the resi@@ due of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the rest of the multi@@ tude .
also the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chal@@ de@@ ans br@@ ake , and carried all the br@@ ass of them to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and the bas@@ ons , and the fi@@ rep@@ ans , and the bo@@ w@@ ls , and the cal@@ dr@@ ons , and the cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks , and the sp@@ o@@ ons , and the c@@ ups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
and a chap@@ iter of br@@ ass was upon it ; and the he@@ ight of one chap@@ iter was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , with network and po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates upon the chap@@ it@@ ers round about , all of br@@ ass . the second pil@@ lar also and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were like un@@ to these .
and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on smo@@ te them , and put them to death in R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . thus Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his own land .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ buz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and for his di@@ et , there was a contin@@ ual di@@ et given him of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ ep@@ eth sor@@ e in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks : among all her lov@@ ers she hat@@ h none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her , they are become her enem@@ ies .
the ad@@ versary hat@@ h spread out his hand upon all her pleas@@ ant things : for she hat@@ h seen that the he@@ a@@ then entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , whom th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st command that they should not enter into TH@@ Y Con@@ gre@@ gation .
from above hat@@ h he sent fire into my b@@ ones , and it prev@@ ail@@ eth against them : he hat@@ h spread a net for my feet , he hat@@ h turned me back : he hat@@ h made me de@@ so@@ late and fa@@ int all the day .
the yok@@ e of my trans@@ gres@@ sions is bound by his hand : they are w@@ re@@ ath@@ ed , and come up upon my nec@@ k : he hat@@ h made my strength to fall , the Lord hat@@ h delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
the Lord hat@@ h tro@@ dden under fo@@ ot all my m@@ igh@@ ty men in the mid@@ st of me : he hat@@ h called an assembly against me to cr@@ ush my young men : the Lord hat@@ h tro@@ dden the vir@@ gin , the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h , as in a win@@ e@@ press .
how hat@@ h the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger , and cast down from heav@@ en un@@ to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , and remember@@ ed not his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger !
the Lord hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all the habi@@ tations of Jac@@ o@@ b , and hat@@ h not p@@ iti@@ ed : he hat@@ h thrown down in his wr@@ ath the strong holds of the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h ; he hat@@ h brought them down to the ground : he hat@@ h pollu@@ ted the k@@ ing@@ dom and the pr@@ inces there@@ of .
he hat@@ h b@@ ent his bo@@ w like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an ad@@ versary , and sle@@ w all that were pleas@@ ant to the eye in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the daughter of Z@@ ion : he p@@ oured out his fur@@ y like fire .
the Lord was as an enemy : he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up Israel , he hat@@ h sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces : he hat@@ h destroyed his strong holds , and hat@@ h increased in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
the Lord hat@@ h cast off his alt@@ ar , he hat@@ h ab@@ hor@@ red his sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he hat@@ h given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her pal@@ aces ; they have made a no@@ ise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a so@@ lem@@ n feast .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit upon the ground , and keep sil@@ ence : they have cast up d@@ ust upon their heads ; they have gir@@ ded themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
mine eyes do fail with te@@ ars , my bo@@ wel@@ s are troubled , my li@@ ver is p@@ oured upon the ear@@ th , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the su@@ ck@@ lings s@@ wo@@ on in the streets of the city .
the Lord hat@@ h done that which he had dev@@ ised ; he hat@@ h fulfilled his word that he had comman@@ ded in the days of old : he hat@@ h thrown down , and hat@@ h not p@@ iti@@ ed : and he hat@@ h caused th@@ ine enemy to re@@ jo@@ ice over the@@ e , he hat@@ h set up the Hor@@ n of th@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ aries .
their heart cri@@ ed un@@ to the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let te@@ ars run down like a river day and night : give th@@ y@@ self no rest ; let not the app@@ le of th@@ ine eye ce@@ ase .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the wat@@ ches p@@ our out th@@ ine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up TH@@ Y hands toward him for the life of TH@@ Y young children , that fa@@ int for hunger in the top of every street .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ g@@ ins and my young men are fallen by the s@@ word ; th@@ ou h@@ ast sla@@ in them in the day of th@@ ine an@@ ger ; th@@ ou h@@ ast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
even the sea mon@@ sters draw out the bre@@ ast , they give su@@ ck to their young ones : the daughter of my people is become cru@@ el , like the os@@ tri@@ ches in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the ton@@ gue of the suc@@ king child cle@@ av@@ eth to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man break@@ eth it un@@ to them .
for the punishment of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of So@@ dom , that was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
they that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word are better than they that be sla@@ in with hunger : for these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the kings of the ear@@ th , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the ad@@ versary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jer@@ usalem .
the an@@ ger of the Lord hat@@ h divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the pri@@ ests , they favoured not the el@@ ders .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , O daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ wel@@ lest in the land of U@@ z ; the c@@ up also shall pass through un@@ to the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt be dr@@ un@@ ken , and s@@ halt make th@@ y@@ self nak@@ ed .
now it came to pass in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
and I looked , and , be@@ hold , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind came out of the north , a great cl@@ oud , and a fire in@@ fol@@ ding itself , and a bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was about it , and out of the mid@@ st there@@ of as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber , out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
also out of the mid@@ st there@@ of came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . and this was their appearance ; they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
and their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot : and they spar@@ k@@ led like the col@@ our of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
as for the lik@@ eness of the living cre@@ atures , their appearance was like burning co@@ als of fire , and like the appearance of lam@@ ps : it went up and down among the living cre@@ atures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth ligh@@ t@@ ning .
the appearance of the whe@@ els and their work was like un@@ to the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l : and they four had one lik@@ eness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a whe@@ el in the middle of a whe@@ el .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ so@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went , th@@ ither was their spirit to go ; and the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
and under the fir@@ mam@@ ent were their w@@ ings stra@@ ight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and when they went , I heard the no@@ ise of their w@@ ings , like the no@@ ise of great waters , as the voice of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty , the voice of speech , as the no@@ ise of an host : when they stood , they let down their w@@ ings .
and above the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone : and upon the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was the lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I saw as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , and from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness round about .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , ) yet shall know that there hat@@ h been a pro@@ phe@@ t among them .
not to many people of a st@@ range speech and of an hard language , whose words th@@ ou can@@ st not understand . su@@ rely , had I sent the@@ e to them , they would have hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to the@@ e .
and go , get the@@ e to them of the cap@@ tivity , un@@ to the children of TH@@ Y people , and speak un@@ to them , and tell them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear .
I heard also the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures that touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els over against them , and a no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
then I ar@@ ose , and went forth into the pla@@ in : and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord stood there , as the gl@@ ory which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
but th@@ ou , O son of man , be@@ hold , they shall put bands upon the@@ e , and shall bin@@ d the@@ e with them , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not go out among them :
and I will make TH@@ Y ton@@ gue cle@@ ave to the ro@@ of of TH@@ Y m@@ outh , that th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and s@@ halt not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
but when I speak with the@@ e , I will open TH@@ Y m@@ outh , and th@@ ou s@@ halt say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; He that he@@ aret@@ h , let him hear ; and he that for@@ be@@ aret@@ h , let him for@@ bear : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build a For@@ t against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it round about .
lie th@@ ou also upon TH@@ Y left side , and lay the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that th@@ ou s@@ halt lie upon it th@@ ou s@@ halt bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for I have laid upon the@@ e the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days : so s@@ halt th@@ ou bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
and , be@@ hold , I will lay bands upon the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt not turn the@@ e from one side to another , ti@@ ll th@@ ou h@@ ast ended the days of TH@@ Y siege .
and th@@ ou , son of man , take the@@ e a sharp k@@ ni@@ fe , take the@@ e a Bar@@ ber 's ras@@ or , and cause it to pass upon th@@ ine head and upon TH@@ Y be@@ ard : then take the@@ e balan@@ ces to weight , and divide the ha@@ ir .
then take of them again , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the fire , and bur@@ n them in the fire ; for there@@ of shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
and she hat@@ h changed my judg@@ ments into w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess more than the nations , and my stat@@ utes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judg@@ ments and my stat@@ utes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause ye multi@@ p@@ lied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have kept my judg@@ ments , neither have done according to the judg@@ ments of the nations that are round about you ;
and I will do in the@@ e that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the@@ e , and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of the@@ e will I sc@@ at@@ ter into all the winds .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God ; su@@ rely , because th@@ ou h@@ ast def@@ iled my sanc@@ tu@@ ary with all TH@@ Y de@@ te@@ stable things , and with all th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations , therefore will I also dimin@@ ish the@@ e ; neither shall mine eye spar@@ e , neither will I have any p@@ ity .
when I shall send upon them the ev@@ il ar@@ ro@@ ws of fam@@ ine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the fam@@ ine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
and say , Y@@ e mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hil@@ ls , to the rivers , and to the val@@ ley@@ s ; be@@ hold , I , even I , will bring a s@@ word upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
and I will lay the dead car@@ cases of the children of Israel before their id@@ ols ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter your b@@ ones round about your al@@ tar@@ s .
he that is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he that is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he that remain@@ eth and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my fur@@ y upon them .
and mine eye shall not spar@@ e the@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : but I will re@@ compen@@ se TH@@ Y ways upon the@@ e , and th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations shall be in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : I will re@@ compen@@ se the@@ e according to TH@@ Y ways and th@@ ine ab@@ omin@@ ations that are in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that sm@@ ite@@ th .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is tou@@ ching the whole multi@@ tude there@@ of , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ ov@@ es of the val@@ ley@@ s , all of them mourning , every one for his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty : but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and of their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the st@@ ran@@ gers for a pre@@ y , and to the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th for a sp@@ oil ; and they shall poll@@ ute it .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore I will bring the worst of the he@@ a@@ then , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pom@@ p of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be def@@ iled .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h sat before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me .
then I be@@ held , and lo a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even down@@ ward , fire ; and from his lo@@ ins even up@@ ward , as the appearance of bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , as the col@@ our of Am@@ ber .
then said he un@@ to me , Son of man , lift up th@@ ine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and be@@ hold nor@@ th@@ ward at the gate of the alt@@ ar this image of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in the entry .
and there stood before them sev@@ enty men of the an@@ ci@@ ents of the house of Israel , and in the mid@@ st of them stood Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , with every man his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and a th@@ ick cl@@ oud of incen@@ se went up .
and he brought me into the in@@ ner court of the Lord 's house , and , be@@ hold , at the door of the temp@@ le of the Lord , between the por@@ ch and the alt@@ ar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temp@@ le of the Lord , and their faces toward the east ; and they wor@@ shi@@ pped the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in fur@@ y : mine eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity : and though they cry in mine e@@ ars with a l@@ oud voice , yet will I not hear them .
and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was gone up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en , which had the writer 's in@@ k@@ hor@@ n by his side ;
and the Lord said un@@ to him , G@@ o through the mid@@ st of the city , through the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem , and set a mark upon the fore@@ heads of the men that si@@ gh and that cry for all the ab@@ omin@@ ations that be done in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
then I looked , and , be@@ hold , in the fir@@ mam@@ ent that was above the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms there appeared over them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
then the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the Lord 's gl@@ ory .
and one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b stret@@ ched forth his hand from between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms un@@ to the fire that was between the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , and took there@@ of , and put it into the hands of him that was clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en : who took it , and went out .
and when I looked , be@@ hold the four whe@@ els by the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms , one whe@@ el by one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el by another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : and the appearance of the whe@@ els was as the col@@ our of a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els , were full of eyes round about , even the whe@@ els that they four had .
and the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ ms lifted up their w@@ ings , and moun@@ ted up from the ear@@ th in my sight : when they went out , the whe@@ els also were bes@@ ide them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord 's house ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the lik@@ eness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves : they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
and the Spiri@@ t of the Lord fell upon me , and said un@@ to me , Spe@@ ak ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord ; Th@@ us have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ our sla@@ in whom ye have laid in the mid@@ st of it , they are the f@@ les@@ h , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the mid@@ st of it .
and I will bring you out of the mid@@ st there@@ of , and deliver you into the hands of st@@ ran@@ gers , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments among you .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord : for ye have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither executed my judg@@ ments , but have done after the man@@ ners of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their f@@ les@@ h , and will give them an heart of f@@ les@@ h :
and the gl@@ ory of the Lord went up from the mid@@ st of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spiri@@ t of God into Chal@@ de@@ a , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
son of man , th@@ ou d@@ wel@@ lest in the mid@@ st of a rebel@@ li@@ ous house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have e@@ ars to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
in their sight s@@ halt th@@ ou bear it upon TH@@ Y sho@@ ul@@ ders , and carry it forth in the tw@@ il@@ ight : th@@ ou s@@ halt cover TH@@ Y face , that th@@ ou see not the ground : for I have set the@@ e for a sign un@@ to the house of Israel .
and I did so as I was comman@@ ded : I brought forth my stu@@ ff by day , as stu@@ ff for cap@@ tivity , and in the even I dig@@ ged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and I b@@ are it upon my sho@@ ul@@ der in their sight .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are : and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
Y@@ e have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither made up the h@@ edge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
because , even because they have s@@ educ@@ ed my people , saying , Peace ; and there was no peace ; and one built up a wall , and , lo , others da@@ ub@@ ed it with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter :
say un@@ to them which da@@ u@@ b it with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
so will I break down the wall that ye have da@@ ub@@ ed with un@@ temper@@ ed mor@@ ter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation there@@ of shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consu@@ med in the mid@@ st there@@ of : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , by promising him life :
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a pro@@ ver@@ b , and I will cut him off from the mid@@ st of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
be@@ hold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th both the ends of it , and the mid@@ st of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
be@@ hold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured it , and it is burned ?
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall dev@@ our them ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them .
and as for TH@@ Y nati@@ vity , in the day th@@ ou w@@ ast born TH@@ Y nav@@ el was not cut , neither w@@ ast th@@ ou was@@ hed in water to supp@@ le the@@ e ; th@@ ou w@@ ast not sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed the@@ e , to do any of these un@@ to the@@ e , to have comp@@ as@@ sion upon the@@ e ; but th@@ ou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of TH@@ Y person , in the day that th@@ ou w@@ ast born .
thus w@@ ast th@@ ou dec@@ ked with gold and silver ; and TH@@ Y ra@@ im@@ ent was of fine lin@@ en , and sil@@ k , and bro@@ i@@ dered work ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st eat fine fl@@ our , and hon@@ ey , and oil : and th@@ ou w@@ ast exceeding beautiful , and th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st prosp@@ er into a k@@ ing@@ dom .
and of TH@@ Y gar@@ ments th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st take , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st TH@@ Y high places with di@@ vers c@@ olo@@ urs , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot there@@ upon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast also taken TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given the@@ e , and ma@@ dest to th@@ y@@ self images of men , and di@@ d@@ st commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with them ,
my meat also which I gave the@@ e , fine fl@@ our , and oil , and hon@@ ey , where@@ with I f@@ ed the@@ e , th@@ ou h@@ ast even set it before them for a swe@@ et sav@@ our : and thus it was , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
moreover th@@ ou h@@ ast taken TH@@ Y sons and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast bor@@ ne un@@ to me , and these h@@ ast th@@ ou sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed un@@ to them to be dev@@ oured . is this of TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms a small matter ,
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast built TH@@ Y high place at every head of the way , and h@@ ast made TH@@ Y beauty to be ab@@ hor@@ red , and h@@ ast opened TH@@ Y feet to every one that passed by , and multi@@ p@@ lied TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Bec@@ ause TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness was p@@ oured out , and TH@@ Y nak@@ edn@@ ess discovered through TH@@ Y who@@ red@@ oms with TH@@ Y lov@@ ers , and with all the id@@ ols of TH@@ Y ab@@ omin@@ ations , and by the blood of TH@@ Y children , which th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st give un@@ to them ;
and I will also give the@@ e into their hand , and they shall throw down th@@ ine emin@@ ent place , and shall break down TH@@ Y high places : they shall stri@@ p the@@ e also of TH@@ Y clo@@ th@@ es , and shall take TH@@ Y fair je@@ wel@@ s , and leave the@@ e nak@@ ed and b@@ are .
and they shall bur@@ n th@@ ine houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments upon the@@ e in the sight of many women : and I will cause the@@ e to ce@@ ase from playing the har@@ lot , and th@@ ou also s@@ halt give no h@@ ire any more .
so will I make my fur@@ y toward the@@ e to rest , and my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y shall de@@ part from the@@ e , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
T@@ ho@@ u art TH@@ Y mother 's daughter , that lo@@ th@@ eth her husband and her children ; and th@@ ou art the sister of TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , which lo@@ th@@ ed their hus@@ bands and their children : your mother was an H@@ itti@@ te , and your father an Am@@ or@@ ite .
and th@@ ine el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters that d@@ well at TH@@ Y left hand : and TH@@ Y younger sister , that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th at TH@@ Y right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
when I shall bring again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , then will I bring again the cap@@ tivity of TH@@ Y cap@@ tives in the mid@@ st of them :
that th@@ ou may@@ est bear th@@ ine own sh@@ ame , and may@@ est be con@@ founded in all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , in that th@@ ou art a comfor@@ t un@@ to them .
when TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , shall return to their former estate , and Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to their former estate , then th@@ ou and TH@@ Y da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall return to your former estate .
then th@@ ou s@@ halt remember TH@@ Y ways , and be as@@ ha@@ med , when th@@ ou s@@ halt receive TH@@ Y s@@ ist@@ ers , th@@ ine el@@ der and TH@@ Y younger : and I will give them un@@ to the@@ e for da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , but not by TH@@ Y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
that th@@ ou may@@ est remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open TH@@ Y m@@ outh any more because of TH@@ Y sh@@ ame , when I am p@@ ac@@ ified toward the@@ e for all that th@@ ou h@@ ast done , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
he cro@@ pped off the top of his young tw@@ ig@@ s , and carried it into a land of traffic@@ k ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
it was plan@@ ted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a good@@ ly v@@ ine .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely in the place where the king d@@ wel@@ le@@ th that made him king , whose oath he desp@@ ised , and whose C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant he br@@ ake , even with him in the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on he shall die .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and will p@@ lead with him there for his t@@ res@@ pass that he hat@@ h t@@ res@@ passed against me .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the s@@ word , and they that remain shall be sc@@ at@@ tered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it .
and hat@@ h not e@@ aten upon the mountains , neither hat@@ h lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither hat@@ h def@@ iled his neighbour 's wife , neither hat@@ h come near to a men@@ stru@@ ous woman ,
and hat@@ h not op@@ pressed any , but hat@@ h restored to the deb@@ tor his pledge , hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled none by violence , hat@@ h given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and hat@@ h covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
neither hat@@ h op@@ pressed any , hat@@ h not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hat@@ h sp@@ o@@ iled by violence , but hat@@ h given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and hat@@ h covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ,
that hat@@ h taken off his hand from the poor , that hat@@ h not received us@@ ury nor increase , hat@@ h executed my judg@@ ments , hat@@ h walked in my stat@@ utes ; he shall not die for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall su@@ rely live .
as for his father , because he cru@@ el@@ ly op@@ pressed , sp@@ o@@ iled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked will turn from all his sin@@ s that he hat@@ h committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he hat@@ h committed , they shall not be mentioned un@@ to him : in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness that he hat@@ h done he shall live .
and it came to pass in the seventh year , in the fifth month , the tenth day of the month , that certain of the el@@ ders of Israel came to inqu@@ ire of the Lord , and sat before me .
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand un@@ to the se@@ ed of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and made myself known un@@ to them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand un@@ to them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had es@@ p@@ ied for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands :
but I w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted before the he@@ a@@ then , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known un@@ to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
yet also I lifted up my hand un@@ to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
but I said un@@ to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , Wal@@ k ye not in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their judg@@ ments , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols :
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and w@@ rought for my name 's sake , that it should not be pollu@@ ted in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them forth .
therefore , son of man , speak un@@ to the house of Israel , and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Y@@ et in this your fa@@ thers have b@@ las@@ phe@@ med me , in that they have committed a t@@ res@@ pass against me .
and I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries where@@ in ye are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with a stret@@ ched out arm , and with fur@@ y p@@ oured out .
and I will cause you to pass under the ro@@ d , and I will bring you into the bond of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant :
and I will pur@@ ge out from among you the rebels , and them that trans@@ gress against me : I will bring them forth out of the country where they so@@ jour@@ n , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; G@@ o ye , serve ye every one his id@@ ols , and her@@ e@@ after also , if ye will not he@@ arken un@@ to me : but poll@@ ute ye my hol@@ y name no more with your gifts , and with your id@@ ols .
for in mine hol@@ y mountain , in the mountain of the he@@ ight of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offer@@ ings , and the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of your ob@@ lations , with all your hol@@ y things .
I will accept you with your swe@@ et sav@@ our , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries where@@ in ye have been sc@@ at@@ tered ; and I will be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in you before the he@@ a@@ then .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fa@@ thers .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , where@@ in ye have been def@@ iled ; and ye shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for all your ev@@ ils that ye have committed .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have w@@ rought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your w@@ ic@@ ked ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , O ye house of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and he hat@@ h give it to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : this s@@ word is shar@@ pen@@ ed , and it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the S@@ lay@@ er .
also , th@@ ou son of man , appoint the@@ e two ways , that the s@@ word of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on may come : both tw@@ ain shall come forth out of one land : and choose th@@ ou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
and it shall be un@@ to them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , to them that have sworn o@@ aths : but he will call to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that they may be taken .
shall I cause it to return into his she@@ ath ? I will judge the@@ e in the place where th@@ ou w@@ ast created , in the land of TH@@ Y nati@@ vity .
and I will p@@ our out mine in@@ dign@@ ation upon the@@ e , I will blow against the@@ e in the fire of my wr@@ ath , and deliver the@@ e into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and s@@ kil@@ ful to destroy .
in the@@ e have they set light by father and mother : in the mid@@ st of the@@ e have they dealt by op@@ pression with the st@@ ran@@ ger : in the@@ e have they v@@ ex@@ ed the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dro@@ ss : all they are br@@ ass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace ; they are even the dro@@ ss of silver .
there is a con@@ spir@@ acy of her pro@@ ph@@ ets in the mid@@ st there@@ of , like a ro@@ aring lion ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y ; they have dev@@ oured so@@ ul@@ s ; they have taken the treasure and pre@@ ci@@ ous things ; they have made her many wi@@ dows in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
and they committed who@@ red@@ oms in Egypt ; they committed who@@ red@@ oms in their youth : there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there they bru@@ ised the te@@ ats of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
thus she committed her who@@ red@@ oms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and with all on whom she do@@ ted : with all their id@@ ols she def@@ iled her@@ self .
neither left she her who@@ red@@ oms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bru@@ ised the bre@@ asts of her vir@@ gin@@ ity , and p@@ oured their wh@@ ore@@ dom upon her .
yet she multi@@ p@@ lied her who@@ red@@ oms , in calling to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance the days of her youth , where@@ in she had played the har@@ lot in the land of Egypt .
thus will I make TH@@ Y le@@ w@@ d@@ ness to ce@@ ase from the@@ e , and TH@@ Y wh@@ ore@@ dom brought from the land of Egypt : so that th@@ ou s@@ halt not lift up th@@ ine eyes un@@ to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will deliver the@@ e into the hand of them whom th@@ ou ha@@ test , into the hand of them from whom TH@@ Y mind is ali@@ en@@ ated :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt even drink it and su@@ ck it out , and th@@ ou s@@ halt break the sh@@ er@@ ds there@@ of , and p@@ lu@@ ck off th@@ ine own bre@@ asts : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
that they have committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and blood is in their hands , and with their id@@ ols have they committed ad@@ ul@@ tery , and have also caused their sons , whom they b@@ are un@@ to me , to pass for them through the fire , to dev@@ our them .
and furthermore , that ye have sent for men to come from far , un@@ to whom a mes@@ sen@@ ger was sent ; and , lo , they came : for whom th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st was@@ h th@@ y@@ self , pain@@ ted@@ st TH@@ Y eyes , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st th@@ y@@ self with or@@ nam@@ ents ,
yet they went in un@@ to her , as they go in un@@ to a woman that play@@ eth the har@@ lot : so went they in un@@ to A@@ ho@@ lah and un@@ to Ah@@ ol@@ i@@ bah , the le@@ w@@ d women .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall s@@ lay their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; Wo@@ e to the blo@@ ody city , to the po@@ t whose sc@@ um is there@@ in , and whose sc@@ um is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall up on it .
then set it empty upon the co@@ als there@@ of , that the br@@ ass of it may be hot , and may bur@@ n , and that the fil@@ th@@ iness of it may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that the sc@@ um of it may be consu@@ med .
in TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness is le@@ w@@ d@@ ness : because I have p@@ urged the@@ e , and th@@ ou w@@ ast not p@@ urged , th@@ ou s@@ halt not be p@@ urged from TH@@ Y fil@@ th@@ iness any more , ti@@ ll I have caused my fur@@ y to rest upon the@@ e .
be@@ hold , therefore I will deliver the@@ e to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their pal@@ aces in the@@ e , and make their d@@ wel@@ lings in the@@ e : they shall eat TH@@ Y fruit , and they shall drink TH@@ Y milk .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
and I will lay my ven@@ ge@@ ance upon E@@ dom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in E@@ dom according to mine an@@ ger and according to my fur@@ y ; and they shall know my ven@@ ge@@ ance , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
it shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets in the mid@@ st of the sea : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord God : and it shall become a sp@@ oil to the nations .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will bring upon T@@ y@@ ru@@ s Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , a king of kings , from the north , with hor@@ ses , and with char@@ i@@ ots , and with hor@@ se@@ men , and companies , and much people .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all TH@@ Y streets : he shall s@@ lay TH@@ Y people by the s@@ word , and TH@@ Y strong gar@@ ris@@ ons shall go down to the ground .
and they shall make a sp@@ oil of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches , and make a pre@@ y of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise : and they shall break down TH@@ Y walls , and destroy TH@@ Y pleas@@ ant houses : and they shall lay TH@@ Y stones and TH@@ Y tim@@ ber and TH@@ Y d@@ ust in the mid@@ st of the water .
then all the pr@@ inces of the sea shall come down from their th@@ ron@@ es , and lay away their rob@@ es , and put off their bro@@ i@@ dered gar@@ ments : they shall clo@@ the themselves with tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tre@@ m@@ ble at every moment , and be ast@@ on@@ ished at the@@ e .
and say un@@ to T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , O th@@ ou that art situ@@ ate at the entry of the sea , which art a mer@@ chan@@ t of the people for many is@@ les , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; O T@@ y@@ ru@@ s , th@@ ou h@@ ast said , I am of perfect beauty .
of the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an have they made th@@ ine o@@ ars ; the company of the As@@ hur@@ ites have made TH@@ Y ben@@ ches of Iv@@ ory , brought out of the is@@ les of Ch@@ it@@ tim .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with th@@ ine army were upon TH@@ Y walls round about , and the G@@ am@@ ma@@ di@@ ms were in TH@@ Y tow@@ ers : they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds upon TH@@ Y walls round about ; they have made TH@@ Y beauty perfect .
these were TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts in all sor@@ ts of things , in blue clo@@ th@@ es , and bro@@ i@@ dered work , and in ch@@ ests of rich appar@@ el , bound with cor@@ ds , and made of c@@ ed@@ ar , among TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish did sing of the@@ e in TH@@ Y market : and th@@ ou w@@ ast rep@@ len@@ ished , and made very g@@ lor@@ ious in the mid@@ st of the seas .
and all that handle the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , and all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against the@@ e , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust upon their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
when TH@@ Y war@@ es went forth out of the seas , th@@ ou fil@@ led@@ st many people ; th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st en@@ rich the kings of the ear@@ th with the multi@@ tude of TH@@ Y ri@@ ches and of TH@@ Y mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
be@@ hold , therefore I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers upon the@@ e , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations : and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of TH@@ Y wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile TH@@ Y bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
T@@ ho@@ u art the ano@@ in@@ ted ch@@ er@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set the@@ e so : th@@ ou w@@ ast upon the hol@@ y mountain of God ; th@@ ou h@@ ast walked up and down in the mid@@ st of the stones of fire .
Th@@ ine heart was lifted up because of TH@@ Y beauty , th@@ ou h@@ ast cor@@ rupted TH@@ Y wis@@ dom by reason of TH@@ Y bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness : I will cast the@@ e to the ground , I will lay the@@ e before kings , that they may be@@ hold the@@ e .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are sc@@ at@@ tered , and shall be sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , then shall they d@@ well in their land that I have given to my ser@@ vant Jac@@ o@@ b .
but I will put ho@@ oks in TH@@ Y j@@ a@@ ws , and I will cause the fish of TH@@ Y rivers to stick un@@ to TH@@ Y scal@@ es , and I will bring the@@ e up out of the mid@@ st of TH@@ Y rivers , and all the fish of TH@@ Y rivers shall stick un@@ to TH@@ Y scal@@ es .
and I will leave the@@ e thrown into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , the@@ e and all the fish of TH@@ Y rivers : th@@ ou s@@ halt fall upon the open fields ; th@@ ou s@@ halt not be brought together , nor gathered : I have given the@@ e for meat to the be@@ asts of the field and to the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en .
when they took hold of the@@ e by TH@@ Y hand , th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st break , and ren@@ d all their sho@@ ul@@ der : and when they le@@ an@@ ed upon the@@ e , th@@ ou br@@ ak@@ est , and ma@@ dest all their lo@@ ins to be at a stand .
be@@ hold , therefore I am against the@@ e , and against TH@@ Y rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt ut@@ ter@@ ly waste and de@@ so@@ late , from the to@@ wer of S@@ yen@@ e even un@@ to the border of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia .
and I will make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be de@@ so@@ late for@@ ty years : and I will sc@@ at@@ ter the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their habi@@ tation ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will give the land of Egypt un@@ to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ z@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and he shall take her multi@@ tude , and take her sp@@ oil , and take her pre@@ y ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
in that day will I cause the Hor@@ n of the house of Israel to bu@@ d forth , and I will give the@@ e the opening of the m@@ outh in the mid@@ st of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , and Libya , and Ly@@ dia , and all the min@@ g@@ led people , and Ch@@ u@@ b , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the s@@ word .
and they shall be de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late , and her cities shall be in the mid@@ st of the cities that are was@@ ted .
and I will make the rivers d@@ ry , and sell the land into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is there@@ in , by the hand of st@@ ran@@ gers : I the Lord have spoken it .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; I will also destroy the id@@ ols , and I will cause their images to ce@@ ase out of N@@ op@@ h ; and there shall be no more a pr@@ ince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
at Te@@ ha@@ ph@@ ne@@ hes also the day shall be dar@@ ken@@ ed , when I shall break there the yok@@ es of Egypt : and the pom@@ p of her strength shall ce@@ ase in her : as for her , a cl@@ oud shall cover her , and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall go into cap@@ tivity .
and it came to pass in the ele@@ venth year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be he@@ aled , to put a rol@@ ler to bin@@ d it , to make it strong to hold the s@@ word .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I am against P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the s@@ word to fall out of his hand .
and I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put my s@@ word in his hand : but I will break P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's arms , and he shall gro@@ an before him with the gro@@ an@@ ings of a deadly wounded man .
therefore his he@@ ight was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field , and his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and his branches became long because of the multi@@ tude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en made their nes@@ ts in his b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and under his branches did all the be@@ asts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the he@@ a@@ then ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him : I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
they also went down into hell with him un@@ to them that be sla@@ in with the s@@ word ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the he@@ a@@ then .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
then will I leave the@@ e upon the land , I will cast the@@ e forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en to remain upon the@@ e , and I will fill the be@@ asts of the whole ear@@ th with the@@ e .
I will also water with TH@@ Y blood the land where@@ in th@@ ou swim@@ me@@ st , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of the@@ e .
and when I shall put the@@ e out , I will cover the heav@@ en , and make the stars there@@ of dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give her light .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause TH@@ Y multi@@ tude to fall , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , all of them : and they shall sp@@ oil the pom@@ p of Egypt , and all the multi@@ tude there@@ of shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late , and the country shall be de@@ stitute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
it came to pass also in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to me , saying ,
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , un@@ to the ne@@ ther parts of the ear@@ th , with them that go down into the p@@ it .
whose graves are set in the sides of the p@@ it , and her company is round about her grave : all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Mes@@ h@@ ech , T@@ ub@@ al , and all her multi@@ tude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings , and all her pr@@ inces , which with their might are laid by them that were sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with them that go down to the p@@ it .
for I have caused my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be laid in the mid@@ st of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised with them that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his multi@@ tude , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
son of man , speak to the children of TH@@ Y people , and say un@@ to them , When I bring the s@@ word upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their co@@ asts , and set him for their watch@@ man :
so th@@ ou , O son of man , I have set the@@ e a watch@@ man un@@ to the house of Israel ; therefore th@@ ou s@@ halt hear the word at my m@@ outh , and warn them from me .
nevertheless , if th@@ ou warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but th@@ ou h@@ ast delivered TH@@ Y sou@@ l .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ f@@ th year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jer@@ usalem came un@@ to me , saying , The city is s@@ mit@@ ten .
and , lo , th@@ ou art un@@ to them as a very lov@@ ely song of one that hat@@ h a pleas@@ ant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear TH@@ Y words , but they do them not .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord God , su@@ rely because my flock became a pre@@ y , and my flock became meat to every be@@ ast of the field , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , neither did my she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds search for my flock , but the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds f@@ ed themselves , and f@@ ed not my flock ;
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and fe@@ ed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will fe@@ ed them in a good pas@@ ture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a f@@ at pas@@ ture shall they fe@@ ed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bin@@ d up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was si@@ ck : but I will destroy the f@@ at and the strong ; I will fe@@ ed them with judgment .
Se@@ eme@@ th it a small thing un@@ to you to have e@@ aten up the good pas@@ ture , but ye must tre@@ ad down with your feet the resi@@ due of your pas@@ tures ? and to have dr@@ un@@ k of the deep waters , but ye must f@@ oul the resi@@ due with your feet ?
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have tro@@ dden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
and I will make with them a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace , and will cause the ev@@ il be@@ asts to ce@@ ase out of the land : and they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sle@@ ep in the wo@@ ods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in his season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
and they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the he@@ a@@ then , neither shall the be@@ ast of the land dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well saf@@ ely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with hunger in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the he@@ a@@ then any more .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast had a perpet@@ ual hatred , and h@@ ast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the s@@ word in the time of their cal@@ am@@ ity , in the time that their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity had an end :
and I will fill his mountains with his sla@@ in men : in TH@@ Y hil@@ ls , and in TH@@ Y val@@ ley@@ s , and in all TH@@ Y rivers , shall they fall that are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all TH@@ Y b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies which th@@ ou h@@ ast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid de@@ so@@ late , they are given us to consum@@ e .
Ye@@ a , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall poss@@ ess the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt be their inher@@ it@@ ance , and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more hen@@ ce@@ forth ber@@ e@@ ave them of men .
neither will I cause men to hear in the@@ e the sh@@ ame of the he@@ a@@ then any more , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of the people any more , neither s@@ halt th@@ ou cause TH@@ Y nations to fall any more , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
then will I sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you an heart of f@@ les@@ h .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my stat@@ utes , and ye shall keep my judg@@ ments , and do them .
then shall ye remember your own ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good , and shall lo@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleans@@ ed you from all your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities I will also cause you to d@@ well in the cities , and the was@@ tes shall be buil@@ ded .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley which was full of b@@ ones ,
therefore pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
moreover , th@@ ou son of man , take the@@ e one stick , and write upon it , For Ju@@ da@@ h , and for the children of Israel his compan@@ ions : then take another stick , and write upon it , For Joseph , the stick of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and for all the house of Israel his compan@@ ions :
and say un@@ to them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord God ; be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the he@@ a@@ then , w@@ hi@@ ther they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms any more at all :
neither shall they def@@ ile themselves any more with their id@@ ols , nor with their de@@ te@@ stable things , nor with any of their trans@@ gres@@ sions : but I will save them out of all their d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places , where@@ in they have sin@@ ned , and will cleans@@ e them : so shall they be my people , and I will be their God .
and they shall d@@ well in the land that I have given un@@ to Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant , where@@ in your fa@@ thers have d@@ wel@@ t ; and they shall d@@ well there@@ in , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my ser@@ vant David shall be their pr@@ ince for ever .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt come from TH@@ Y place out of the north parts , th@@ ou , and many people with the@@ e , all of them ri@@ ding upon hor@@ ses , a great company , and a m@@ igh@@ ty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that my fur@@ y shall come up in my face .
and I will p@@ lead against him with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an over@@ flow@@ ing rain , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and bri@@ m@@ stone .
and I will turn the@@ e back , and leave but the sixth part of the@@ e , and will cause the@@ e to come up from the north parts , and will bring the@@ e upon the mountains of Israel :
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt fall upon the mountains of Israel , th@@ ou , and all TH@@ Y bands , and the people that is with the@@ e : I will give the@@ e un@@ to the ra@@ ven@@ ous birds of every sort , and to the be@@ asts of the field to be dev@@ oured .
so will I make my hol@@ y name known in the mid@@ st of my people Israel ; and I will not let them poll@@ ute my hol@@ y name any more : and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I am the Lord , the Holy One in Israel .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall bur@@ n the weapons with fire : and they shall sp@@ oil those that sp@@ o@@ iled them , and ro@@ b those that ro@@ bbed them , sa@@ ith the Lord God .
and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that the house of Israel went into cap@@ tivity for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : because they t@@ res@@ passed against me , therefore hi@@ d I my face from them , and gave them into the hand of their enem@@ ies : so fell they all by the s@@ word .
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them un@@ to their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year after that the city was s@@ mit@@ ten , in the sel@@ f@@ same day the hand of the Lord was upon me , and brought me th@@ ither .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and he brought me th@@ ither , and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he un@@ to the gate which lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east , and went up the st@@ airs there@@ of , and meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , which was one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one Re@@ ed broad .
the space also before the little ch@@ ambers was one cu@@ bit on this side , and the space was one cu@@ bit on that side : and the little ch@@ ambers were six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts there@@ of and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were after the measure of the first gate : the length there@@ of was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and their windows , and their ar@@ ches , and their pal@@ m trees , were after the measure of the gate that lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east ; and they went up un@@ to it by seven steps ; and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were before them : and it had pal@@ m trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts there@@ of .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and the posts there@@ of , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the ar@@ ches there@@ of round about : it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
and the little ch@@ ambers there@@ of , and the posts there@@ of , and the ar@@ ches there@@ of , were according to these measures : and there were windows there@@ in and in the ar@@ ches there@@ of round about : it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and five and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
and the ar@@ ches there@@ of were toward the ou@@ tw@@ ard court ; and pal@@ m trees were upon the posts there@@ of , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts there@@ of were toward the ut@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were upon the posts there@@ of , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and at the side without , as one go@@ eth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the por@@ ch of the gate , were two tables .
and without the in@@ ner gate were the ch@@ ambers of the singers in the in@@ ner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the pri@@ ests , the ke@@ epers of the charge of the alt@@ ar : these are the sons of Zad@@ ok among the sons of L@@ evi , which come near to the Lord to minister un@@ to him .
and he brought me to the por@@ ch of the house , and meas@@ ured each post of the por@@ ch , five cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side : and the b@@ read@@ th of the gate was three cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and three cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
after@@ ward he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the doors of the side ch@@ ambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was sev@@ enty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; and the wall of the building was five cu@@ bi@@ ts th@@ ick round about , and the length there@@ of n@@ in@@ ety cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and he meas@@ ured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies there@@ of on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , with the in@@ ner temp@@ le , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
the door posts , and the narrow windows , and the gal@@ ler@@ ies round about on their three stories , over against the door , ci@@ eled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ;
so that the face of a man was toward the pal@@ m tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the pal@@ m tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
the alt@@ ar of wood was three cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and the length there@@ of two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the cor@@ ners there@@ of , and the length there@@ of , and the walls there@@ of , were of wood : and he said un@@ to me , This is the table that is before the Lord .
and the doors had two leaves ap@@ i@@ ece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were narrow windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side ch@@ ambers of the house , and th@@ ick plan@@ ks .
then he brought me forth into the ut@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
over against the twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts which were for the in@@ ner court , and over against the pav@@ ement which was for the ut@@ ter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a no@@ ise of many waters : and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar ; and I fell upon my face .
now let them put away their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the car@@ cases of their kings , far from me , and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of them for ever .
and the settle shall be fo@@ ur@@ teen cu@@ bi@@ ts long and fo@@ ur@@ teen broad in the four s@@ quar@@ es there@@ of ; and the border about it shall be half a cu@@ bit ; and the bottom there@@ of shall be a cu@@ bit about ; and his st@@ airs shall look toward the east .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes that be of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , which approach un@@ to me , to minister un@@ to me , sa@@ ith the Lord God , a young bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt take of the blood there@@ of , and put it on the four hor@@ ns of it , and on the four cor@@ ners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus s@@ halt th@@ ou cleans@@ e and pur@@ ge it .
when th@@ ou h@@ ast made an end of cleansing it , th@@ ou s@@ halt offer a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram out of the flock without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and th@@ ou s@@ halt offer them before the Lord , and the pri@@ ests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering un@@ to the Lord .
it is for the pr@@ ince ; the pr@@ ince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
in that ye have brought into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary st@@ ran@@ gers , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart , and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , to be in my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , to poll@@ ute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the f@@ at and the blood , and they have broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant because of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
and they shall not come near un@@ to me , to do the office of a pri@@ est un@@ to me , nor to come near to any of my hol@@ y things , in the most hol@@ y place : but they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the in@@ ner court , they shall be clo@@ th@@ ed with lin@@ en gar@@ ments ; and no wo@@ ol shall come upon them , wh@@ il@@ es they minister in the gates of the in@@ ner court , and within .
neither shall they take for their wi@@ ves a wi@@ dow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take ma@@ i@@ den@@ s of the se@@ ed of the house of Israel , or a wi@@ dow that had a pri@@ est before .
and they shall come at no dead person to def@@ ile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hat@@ h had no husband , they may def@@ ile themselves .
and the first of all the fir@@ st@@ fru@@ its of all things , and every ob@@ lation of all , of every sort of your ob@@ lations , shall be the pri@@ est 's : ye shall also give un@@ to the pri@@ est the first of your d@@ ough , that he may cause the b@@ les@@ sing to rest in th@@ ine house .
moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inher@@ it@@ ance , ye shall offer an ob@@ lation un@@ to the Lord , an hol@@ y portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand re@@ eds , and the b@@ read@@ th shall be ten thousand . this shall be hol@@ y in all the borders there@@ of round about .
the hol@@ y portion of the land shall be for the pri@@ ests the ministers of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , which shall come near to minister un@@ to the Lord : and it shall be a place for their houses , and an hol@@ y place for the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
concerning the ordin@@ ance of oil , the b@@ ath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a b@@ ath out of the C@@ or , which is an Ho@@ mer of ten ba@@ ths ; for ten ba@@ ths are an Ho@@ mer :
and the pri@@ est shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four cor@@ ners of the settle of the alt@@ ar , and upon the posts of the gate of the in@@ ner court .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering to the Lord , seven bul@@ loc@@ ks and seven r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h daily the seven days ; and a k@@ id of the go@@ ats daily for a sin offering .
in the seventh month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord God ; The gate of the in@@ ner court that lo@@ ok@@ eth toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ lock without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram : they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h .
and when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way there@@ of .
moreover the pr@@ ince shall not take of the people 's inher@@ it@@ ance by op@@ pression , to th@@ rust them out of their possession ; but he shall give his sons inher@@ it@@ ance out of his own possession : that my people be not sc@@ at@@ tered every man from his possession .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y ch@@ ambers of the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and , be@@ hold , there was a place on the two sides w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then he brought me forth into the ut@@ ter court , and caused me to pass by the four cor@@ ners of the court ; and , be@@ hold , in every cor@@ ner of the court there was a court .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate nor@@ th@@ ward , and led me about the way without un@@ to the ut@@ ter gate by the way that lo@@ ok@@ eth eas@@ tw@@ ard ; and , be@@ hold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and it shall come to pass , that the fis@@ hers shall stand upon it from En @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ di even un@@ to En @@@ -@@ @ eg@@ la@@ im ; they shall be a place to spread forth n@@ ets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
and these shall be the measures there@@ of ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
and the subur@@ bs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the south two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the east two hundred and fif@@ ty , and toward the west two hundred and fif@@ ty .
and the resi@@ due in length over against the ob@@ lation of the hol@@ y portion shall be ten thousand eas@@ tw@@ ard , and ten thousand w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard : and it shall be over against the ob@@ lation of the hol@@ y portion ; and the increase there@@ of shall be for food un@@ to them that serve the city .
moreover from the possession of the L@@ evi@@ tes , and from the possession of the city , being in the mid@@ st of that which is the pr@@ ince 's , between the border of Ju@@ da@@ h and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the pr@@ ince .
and the Lord gave Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Ju@@ da@@ h into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar to the house of his go@@ d ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his go@@ d .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he d@@ rank : so no@@ ur@@ ishing them three years , that at the end there@@ of they might stand before the king .
un@@ to whom the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s gave names : for he gave un@@ to Daniel the name of Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and to Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah , of Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach ; and to Mis@@ ha@@ el , of Mes@@ h@@ ach ; and to A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , of Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go .
then let our coun@@ ten@@ ances be looked upon before the@@ e , and the coun@@ tenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as th@@ ou se@@ est , deal with TH@@ Y servants .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s brought them in before Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the astr@@ olog@@ ers , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for to she@@ w the king his dre@@ ams . so they came and stood before the king .
and it is a rare thing that the king require@@ th , and there is none other that can she@@ w it before the king , except the go@@ ds , whose d@@ wel@@ ling is not with f@@ les@@ h .
I than@@ k the@@ e , and praise the@@ e , O th@@ ou God of my fa@@ thers , who h@@ ast given me wis@@ dom and might , and h@@ ast made known un@@ to me now what we desi@@ red of the@@ e : for th@@ ou h@@ ast now made known un@@ to us the king 's matter .
therefore Daniel went in un@@ to Ari@@ o@@ ch , whom the king had or@@ da@@ ined to destroy the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on : he went and said thus un@@ to him ; D@@ est@@ ro@@ y not the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on : bring me in before the king , and I will she@@ w un@@ to the king the interpre@@ tation .
then Ari@@ o@@ ch brought in Daniel before the king in has@@ te and said thus un@@ to him , I have found a man of the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , that will make known un@@ to the king the interpre@@ tation .
Daniel answ@@ ered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hat@@ h demanded can@@ not the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers , she@@ w un@@ to the king ;
but there is a God in heav@@ en that reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts , and mak@@ eth known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . TH@@ Y dream , and the visions of TH@@ Y head upon TH@@ Y bed , are these ;
as for the@@ e , O king , TH@@ Y th@@ ou@@ ghts came into TH@@ Y mind upon TH@@ Y bed , what should come to pass her@@ e@@ after : and he that reve@@ al@@ eth secre@@ ts mak@@ eth known to the@@ e what shall come to pass .
and wher@@ es@@ o@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the be@@ asts of the field and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en hat@@ h he given into th@@ ine hand , and hat@@ h made the@@ e ru@@ ler over them all . T@@ ho@@ u art this head of gold .
and the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom shall be strong as iron : for@@ as@@ much as iron break@@ eth in pieces and sub@@ du@@ eth all things : and as iron that break@@ eth all these , shall it break in pieces and bru@@ ise .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king made an image of gold , whose he@@ ight was thre@@ es@@ core cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th there@@ of six cu@@ bi@@ ts : he set it up in the pla@@ in of D@@ ura , in the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king sent to gather together the pr@@ inces , the govern@@ ors , and the cap@@ tains , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the coun@@ sel@@ lers , the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ffs , and all the rul@@ ers of the provinces , to come to the dedic@@ ation of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cor@@ net , fl@@ ute , har@@ p , s@@ ack@@ but , p@@ sal@@ tery , and all kinds of musi@@ ck , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and wor@@ shi@@ pped the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king had set up .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar full of fur@@ y , and the form of his vis@@ age was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go : therefore he sp@@ ake , and comman@@ ded that they should heat the fur@@ n@@ ace one seven times more than it was won@@ t to be heated .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my go@@ d , and in whom is the spirit of the hol@@ y go@@ ds : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and be@@ hold a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th , and the he@@ ight there@@ of was great .
the leaves there@@ of were fair , and the fruit there@@ of much , and in it was meat for all : the be@@ asts of the field had shadow under it , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en d@@ wel@@ t in the b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s there@@ of , and all f@@ les@@ h was f@@ ed of it .
he cri@@ ed al@@ oud , and said thus , H@@ ew down the tree , and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves , and sc@@ at@@ ter his fruit : let the be@@ asts get away from under it , and the fo@@ w@@ ls from his branches :
nevertheless leave the st@@ um@@ p of his roots in the ear@@ th , even with a band of iron and br@@ ass , in the tender gr@@ ass of the field ; and let it be w@@ et with the dew of heav@@ en , and let his portion be with the be@@ asts in the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th :
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit there@@ of much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the be@@ asts of the field d@@ wel@@ t , and upon whose branches the fo@@ w@@ ls of the heav@@ en had their habi@@ tation :
the king sp@@ ake , and said , Is not this great Bab@@ yl@@ on , that I have built for the house of the k@@ ing@@ dom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my maj@@ es@@ ty ?
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from heav@@ en , saying , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to the@@ e it is spoken ; The k@@ ing@@ dom is depar@@ ted from the@@ e .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of the house of God which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king , and his pr@@ inces , his wi@@ ves , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank in them .
in the same hour came forth fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the cand@@ le@@ stick upon the pla@@ ister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . and the king sp@@ ake and said un@@ to Daniel , Art th@@ ou that Daniel , which art of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom the king my father brought out of Je@@ w@@ ry ?
and now the wise men , the astr@@ olog@@ ers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known un@@ to me the interpre@@ tation there@@ of : but they could not she@@ w the interpre@@ tation of the thing :
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with scar@@ let , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made a proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then answ@@ ered they and said before the king , That Daniel , which is of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h , regar@@ de@@ th not the@@ e , O king , nor the decree that th@@ ou h@@ ast signed , but mak@@ eth his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sor@@ e disp@@ le@@ ased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he la@@ b@@ oured ti@@ ll the going down of the sun to deliver him .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the m@@ outh of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lor@@ ds ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting : neither were instruments of musi@@ ck brought before him : and his sle@@ ep went from him .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and comman@@ ded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
I make a decree , That in every domin@@ ion of my k@@ ing@@ dom men tre@@ m@@ ble and fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , and ste@@ d@@ fast for ever , and his k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed , and his domin@@ ion shall be even un@@ to the end .
the first was like a lion , and had e@@ ag@@ le 's w@@ ings : I be@@ held ti@@ ll the w@@ ings there@@ of were p@@ lu@@ cked , and it was lifted up from the ear@@ th , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
I saw in the night visions , and , be@@ hold , one like the Son of man came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of heav@@ en , and came to the An@@ cient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and there was given him domin@@ ion , and gl@@ ory , and a k@@ ing@@ dom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his domin@@ ion is an ever@@ lasting domin@@ ion , which shall not pass away , and his k@@ ing@@ dom that which shall not be destroyed .
and the ten hor@@ ns out of this k@@ ing@@ dom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be di@@ verse from the first , and he shall sub@@ due three kings .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Sh@@ us@@ han in the palace , which is in the province of E@@ lam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , there stood before the river a ram which had two hor@@ ns : and the two hor@@ ns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and as I was considering , be@@ hold , an he go@@ at came from the west on the face of the whole ear@@ th , and touched not the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two hor@@ ns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran un@@ to him in the fur@@ y of his power .
Ye@@ a , he mag@@ ni@@ fied himself even to the pr@@ ince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
so he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said un@@ to me , understand , O son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
neither have we hear@@ ken@@ ed un@@ to TH@@ Y servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , which sp@@ ake in TH@@ Y name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
as it is written in the law of Mos@@ es , all this ev@@ il is come upon us : yet made we not our pray@@ er before the Lord our God , that we might turn from our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and understand TH@@ Y truth .
therefore hat@@ h the Lord watched upon the ev@@ il , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he do@@ eth : for we obe@@ yed not his voice .
and now , O Lord our God , that h@@ ast brought TH@@ Y people forth out of the land of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and h@@ ast gotten the@@ e ren@@ own , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
O my God , inc@@ line th@@ ine e@@ ar , and hear ; open th@@ ine eyes , and be@@ hold our de@@ so@@ lations , and the city which is called by TH@@ Y name : for we do not present our supp@@ lic@@ ations before the@@ e for our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ nesses , but for TH@@ Y great mer@@ cies .
Ye@@ a , wh@@ il@@ es I was speaking in pray@@ er , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening ob@@ lation .
and I Daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with me saw not the vision ; but a great qu@@ ak@@ ing fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sle@@ ep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there bre@@ ath left in me .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate , which shall come with an army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prev@@ ail :
and shall also carry cap@@ tives into Egypt their go@@ ds , with their pr@@ inces , and with their pre@@ ci@@ ous vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
and the king of the south shall be moved with cho@@ ler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multi@@ tude ; but the multi@@ tude shall be given into his hand .
after this shall he turn his face un@@ to the is@@ les , and shall take many : but a pr@@ ince for his own behalf shall cause the re@@ pro@@ ach offered by him to ce@@ ase ; without his own re@@ pro@@ ach he shall cause it to turn upon him .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be over@@ flo@@ wn from before him , and shall be broken ; ye@@ a , also the pr@@ ince of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
for the ships of Ch@@ it@@ tim shall come against him : therefore he shall be gri@@ ev@@ ed , and return , and have in@@ dign@@ ation against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with them that for@@ sake the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and arms shall stand on his part , and they shall poll@@ ute the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the ab@@ omin@@ ation that mak@@ eth de@@ so@@ late .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many countries shall be over@@ thrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt : and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
then I Daniel looked , and , be@@ hold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that mak@@ eth de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and n@@ in@@ ety days .
the word of the Lord that came un@@ to Hos@@ ea , the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the days of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
but I will have mer@@ cy upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bo@@ w , nor by s@@ word , nor by battle , by hor@@ ses , nor by hor@@ se@@ men .
yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the s@@ and of the sea , which can@@ not be meas@@ ured nor num@@ ber@@ ed ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are not my people , there it shall be said un@@ to them , Y@@ e are the sons of the living God .
then shall the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of J@@ ez@@ reel .
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and s@@ lay her with thir@@ st .
therefore will I return , and take away my cor@@ n in the time there@@ of , and my wine in the season there@@ of , and will rec@@ over my wo@@ ol and my fla@@ x given to cover her nak@@ edn@@ ess .
and I will destroy her v@@ ines and her fi@@ g trees , where@@ of she hat@@ h said , These are my re@@ wards that my lov@@ ers have given me : and I will make them a forest , and the be@@ asts of the field shall eat them .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ al@@ im , where@@ in she burned incen@@ se to them , and she dec@@ ked her@@ self with her ear@@ r@@ ings and her je@@ wel@@ s , and she went after her lov@@ ers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and I will give her her v@@ ine@@ yards from th@@ ence , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a pr@@ ince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ep@@ ho@@ d , and without ter@@ ap@@ him :
therefore shall the land mour@@ n , and every one that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th there@@ in shall langu@@ ish , with the be@@ asts of the field , and with the fo@@ w@@ ls of heav@@ en ; ye@@ a , the fis@@ hes of the sea also shall be taken away .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask coun@@ sel at their sto@@ cks , and their staff declar@@ eth un@@ to them : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms hat@@ h caused them to er@@ r , and they have gone a wh@@ oring from under their God .
I will not punish your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters when they commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , nor your sp@@ ous@@ es when they commit ad@@ ul@@ tery : for themselves are separated with who@@ res , and they sacrifice with har@@ lots : therefore the people that do@@ th not understand shall fall .
they will not frame their do@@ ings to turn un@@ to their God : for the spirit of who@@ red@@ oms is in the mid@@ st of them , and they have not known the Lord .
for I will be un@@ to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come un@@ to us as the rain , as the latter and former rain un@@ to the ear@@ th .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made pr@@ inces , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them id@@ ols , that they may be cut off .
for they have so@@ wn the wind , and they shall re@@ ap the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : it hat@@ h no stal@@ k : the bu@@ d shall yield no me@@ al : if so be it yield , the st@@ ran@@ gers shall sw@@ allow it up .
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Mem@@ p@@ his shall bur@@ y them : the pleas@@ ant places for their silver , net@@ t@@ les shall poss@@ ess them : thor@@ ns shall be in their tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yok@@ e on their j@@ a@@ ws , and I laid meat un@@ to them .
I will not exec@@ ute the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of mine an@@ ger , I will not return to destroy E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : and I will not enter into the city .
they shall tre@@ m@@ ble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : and I will place them in their houses , sa@@ ith the Lord .
therefore they shall be as the morning cl@@ oud , and as the early dew that pass@@ eth away , as the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman shall come upon him : he is an un@@ wise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
though he be fruit@@ ful among his bre@@ th@@ ren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the Lord shall come up from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and his spring shall become d@@ ry , and his fo@@ un@@ tain shall be dri@@ ed up : he shall sp@@ oil the treasure of all pleas@@ ant vessels .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? pru@@ dent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the trans@@ gres@@ sors shall fall there@@ in .
the v@@ ine is dri@@ ed up , and the fi@@ g tree langu@@ is@@ het@@ h ; the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate tree , the pal@@ m tree also , and the app@@ le tree , even all the trees of the field , are with@@ ered : because joy is with@@ ered away from the sons of men .
O Lord , to the@@ e will I cry : for the fire hat@@ h dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the fla@@ me hat@@ h burned all the trees of the field .
they shall run like m@@ igh@@ ty men ; they shall clim@@ b the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
they shall run to and f@@ ro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall clim@@ b up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a th@@ i@@ ef .
and the Lord shall ut@@ ter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that execu@@ te@@ th his word : for the day of the Lord is great and very ter@@ ri@@ ble ; and who can abide it ?
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your gar@@ ments , and turn un@@ to the Lord your God : for he is gr@@ ac@@ ious and mer@@ ci@@ ful , slow to an@@ ger , and of great kin@@ d@@ ness , and re@@ pen@@ te@@ th him of the ev@@ il .
Ye@@ a , the Lord will answer and say un@@ to his people , be@@ hold , I will send you cor@@ n , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied there@@ with : and I will no more make you a re@@ pro@@ ach among the he@@ a@@ then :
be not afraid , ye be@@ asts of the field : for the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness do spring , for the tree be@@ aret@@ h her fruit , the fi@@ g tree and the v@@ ine do yield their strength .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hat@@ h dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you : and my people shall never be as@@ ha@@ med .
and it shall come to pass after@@ ward , that I will p@@ our out my spirit upon all f@@ les@@ h ; and your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y , your old men shall dream dre@@ ams , your young men shall see visions :
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and will p@@ lead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have sc@@ at@@ tered among the nations , and par@@ ted my land .
Ye@@ a , and what have ye to do with me , O T@@ y@@ re , and Z@@ id@@ on , and all the co@@ asts of Palest@@ ine ? will ye ren@@ der me a re@@ comp@@ ence ? and if ye re@@ comp@@ ence me , swi@@ f@@ tly and spe@@ edil@@ y will I return your re@@ comp@@ ence upon your own head ;
the children also of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem have ye sold un@@ to the Gre@@ cians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hand of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they shall sell them to the Sab@@ e@@ ans , to a people far off : for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
the Lord also shall ro@@ ar out of Z@@ ion , and ut@@ ter his voice from Jer@@ usalem ; and the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th shall shake : but the Lord will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hil@@ ls shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of Ju@@ da@@ h shall flow with waters , and a fo@@ un@@ tain shall come forth of the house of the Lord , and shall water the val@@ ley of Sh@@ it@@ tim .
I will break also the bar of Dam@@ as@@ cus , and cut off the inhabi@@ tant from the pla@@ in of Av@@ en , and him that hol@@ de@@ th the scep@@ tre from the house of E@@ den : and the people of Syria shall go into cap@@ tivity un@@ to K@@ ir , sa@@ ith the Lord .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of the children of Am@@ mon , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they have ri@@ pped up the women with child of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , that they might en@@ large their border :
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it shall dev@@ our the pal@@ aces there@@ of , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a temp@@ est in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind :
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ju@@ da@@ h , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment there@@ of ; because they have desp@@ ised the law of the Lord , and have not kept his comman@@ d@@ ments , and their lies caused them to er@@ r , after the which their fa@@ thers have walked :
that p@@ ant after the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the me@@ ek : and a man and his father will go in un@@ to the same ma@@ id , to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name :
neither shall he stand that hand@@ le@@ th the bo@@ w ; and he that is swift of fo@@ ot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that ri@@ de@@ th the hor@@ se deliver himself .
can a bird fall in a sn@@ are upon the ear@@ th , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a sn@@ are from the ear@@ th , and have taken nothing at all ?
publish in the pal@@ aces at Ash@@ do@@ d , and in the pal@@ aces in the land of Egypt , and say , assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves upon the mountains of Samar@@ ia , and be@@ hold the great t@@ um@@ ults in the mid@@ st there@@ of , and the op@@ pressed in the mid@@ st there@@ of .
that in the day that I shall visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel upon him I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l : and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , sa@@ ith the Lord .
and also I have with@@ hol@@ den the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the har@@ v@@ est : and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was ra@@ ined upon , and the piece where@@ upon it ra@@ ined not with@@ ered .
For@@ as@@ much therefore as your t@@ reading is upon the poor , and ye take from him bur@@ den@@ s of wheat : ye have built houses of he@@ wn stone , but ye shall not d@@ well in them ; ye have plan@@ ted pleas@@ ant v@@ ine@@ yards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
that lie upon beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves upon their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
thus hat@@ h the Lord God she@@ wed un@@ to me ; and , be@@ hold , he formed gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mo@@ w@@ ings .
and it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord God , that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will dar@@ ken the ear@@ th in the clear day :
and they shall w@@ ander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and f@@ ro to seek the word of the Lord , and shall not find it .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ mel , I will search and take them out th@@ ence ; and though they be hi@@ d from my sight in the bottom of the sea , th@@ ence will I command the ser@@ p@@ ent , and he shall bi@@ te them :
it is he that buil@@ de@@ th his stories in the heav@@ en , and hat@@ h founded his troop in the ear@@ th ; he that cal@@ le@@ th for the waters of the sea , and p@@ ou@@ re@@ th them out upon the face of the ear@@ th : the Lord is his name .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as cor@@ n is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least gra@@ in fall upon the ear@@ th .
in that day will I raise up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches there@@ of ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , and drink the wine there@@ of ; they shall also make gar@@ den@@ s , and eat the fruit of them .
but th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not have looked on the day of TH@@ Y brother in the day that he became a st@@ ran@@ ger ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have spoken pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .
T@@ ho@@ u sho@@ ul@@ dest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity ; ye@@ a , th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest not have looked on their aff@@ li@@ ction in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity , nor have laid hands on their sub@@ stance in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity ;
neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have stood in the cross@@ way , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither sho@@ ul@@ dest th@@ ou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of dist@@ ress .
for as ye have dr@@ un@@ k upon my hol@@ y mountain , so shall all the he@@ a@@ then drink continu@@ ally , ye@@ a , they shall drink , and they shall sw@@ allow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and the house of Jac@@ o@@ b shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a fla@@ me , and the house of E@@ sa@@ u for st@@ ub@@ ble , and they shall kin@@ dle in them , and dev@@ our them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of E@@ sa@@ u ; for the Lord hat@@ h spoken it .
for th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st cast me into the deep , in the mid@@ st of the seas ; and the floods comp@@ ass@@ ed me about : all TH@@ Y bil@@ lows and TH@@ Y waves passed over me .
so the people of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
for word came un@@ to the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and he laid his ro@@ be from him , and covered him with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but let man and be@@ ast be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly un@@ to God : ye@@ a , let them turn every one from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their ev@@ il way ; and God re@@ pen@@ ted of the ev@@ il , that he had said that he would do un@@ to them ; and he did it not .
so Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the shadow , ti@@ ll he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a go@@ ur@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his gri@@ ef . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the go@@ ur@@ d .
Wo@@ e to them that dev@@ ise in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and work ev@@ il upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practi@@ se it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they c@@ ov@@ et fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
the bre@@ aker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them ; and they break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry un@@ to the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have beha@@ ved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets that make my people er@@ r , that bi@@ te with their te@@ eth , and cry , Peace ; and he that p@@ ut@@ te@@ th not into their m@@ ou@@ ths , they even prepare war against him .
therefore night shall be un@@ to you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark un@@ to you , that ye shall not div@@ ine ; and the sun shall go down over the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day shall be dark over them .
but in the last days it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains , and it shall be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and people shall flow un@@ to it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his go@@ d , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
and he shall stand and fe@@ ed in the strength of the Lord , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great un@@ to the ends of the ear@@ th .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into our land : and when he shall tre@@ ad in our pal@@ aces , then shall we raise against him seven she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and eight principal men .
and they shall waste the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a with the s@@ word , and the land of N@@ im@@ ro@@ d in the en@@ tran@@ ces there@@ of : thus shall he deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , when he co@@ me@@ th into our land , and when he tre@@ ade@@ th within our borders .
TH@@ Y Gra@@ ven images also will I cut off , and TH@@ Y standing images out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more worship the work of th@@ ine hands .
hear ye , O mountains , the Lord 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the ear@@ th : for the Lord hat@@ h a controversy with his people , and he will p@@ lead with Israel .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt eat , but not be satisfied ; and TH@@ Y casting down shall be in the mid@@ st of the@@ e ; and th@@ ou s@@ halt take hold , but s@@ halt not deliver ; and that which th@@ ou deliver@@ est will I give up to the s@@ word .
T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt so@@ w , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not re@@ ap ; th@@ ou s@@ halt tre@@ ad the ol@@ ives , but th@@ ou s@@ halt not ano@@ int the@@ e with oil ; and swe@@ et wine , but s@@ halt not drink wine .
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th the father , the daughter ris@@ eth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of the Lord , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ lead my cause , and exec@@ ute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall be@@ hold his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
he will turn again , he will have comp@@ as@@ sion upon us ; he will sub@@ due our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities ; and th@@ ou w@@ il@@ t cast all their sin@@ s into the dep@@ ths of the sea .
the Lord is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will not at all acqu@@ it the w@@ ic@@ ked : the Lord hat@@ h his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .
the shield of his m@@ igh@@ ty men is made red , the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let : the char@@ i@@ ots shall be with f@@ laming tor@@ ches in the day of his preparation , and the f@@ ir trees shall be ter@@ ri@@ bly shaken .
where is the d@@ wel@@ ling of the li@@ ons , and the fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ place of the young li@@ ons , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whel@@ p , and none made them afraid ?
the Hor@@ sem@@ an lif@@ te@@ th up both the bright s@@ word and the g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar : and there is a multi@@ tude of sla@@ in , and a great number of car@@ cases ; and there is none end of their cor@@ p@@ ses ; they st@@ um@@ ble upon their cor@@ p@@ ses :
yet was she carried away , she went into cap@@ tivity : her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honour@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in cha@@ ins .
TH@@ Y crow@@ ned are as the loc@@ ust@@ s , and TH@@ Y cap@@ tains as the great gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers , which camp in the h@@ ed@@ ges in the cold day , but when the sun ar@@ is@@ eth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
for , lo , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and has@@ ty nation , which shall march through the b@@ read@@ th of the land , to poss@@ ess the d@@ wel@@ l@@ ing@@ places that are not the@@ ir@@ s .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than the le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves : and their hor@@ se@@ men shall spread themselves , and their hor@@ se@@ men shall come from far ; they shall fly as the e@@ ag@@ le that has@@ te@@ th to eat .
T@@ ho@@ u art of pu@@ rer eyes than to be@@ hold ev@@ il , and can@@ st not look on in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : where@@ fore lo@@ ok@@ est th@@ ou upon them that deal t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and hol@@ dest TH@@ Y ton@@ gue when the w@@ ic@@ ked dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th the man that is more righ@@ te@@ ous than he ?
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the to@@ wer , and will watch to see what he will say un@@ to me , and what I shall answer when I am re@@ proved .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will su@@ rely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast sp@@ o@@ iled many nations , all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people shall sp@@ oil the@@ e ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that d@@ well there@@ in .
Wo@@ e to him that c@@ ov@@ ete@@ th an ev@@ il c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness to his house , that he may set his n@@ est on high , that he may be delivered from the power of ev@@ il !
TH@@ Y bo@@ w was made quite nak@@ ed , according to the o@@ aths of the tri@@ bes , even TH@@ Y word . Se@@ lah . T@@ ho@@ u di@@ d@@ st cle@@ ave the ear@@ th with rivers .
T@@ ho@@ u w@@ en@@ test forth for the sal@@ vation of TH@@ Y people , even for sal@@ vation with th@@ ine ano@@ in@@ ted ; th@@ ou wo@@ un@@ de@@ d@@ st the head out of the house of the w@@ ic@@ ked , by dis@@ covering the foundation un@@ to the nec@@ k . Se@@ lah .
the word of the Lord which came un@@ to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of C@@ us@@ hi , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Amar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hiz@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
hold TH@@ Y peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hat@@ h prepared a sacrifice , he hat@@ h bid his guests .
therefore their goods shall become a bo@@ o@@ ty , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation : they shall also build houses , but not in@@ ha@@ bit them ; and they shall plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but not drink the wine there@@ of .
the Lord will be ter@@ ri@@ ble un@@ to them : for he will fam@@ ish all the go@@ ds of the ear@@ th ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the is@@ les of the he@@ a@@ then .
in that day s@@ halt th@@ ou not be as@@ ha@@ med for all TH@@ Y do@@ ings , where@@ in th@@ ou h@@ ast trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for then I will take away out of the mid@@ st of the@@ e them that re@@ jo@@ ice in TH@@ Y pride , and th@@ ou s@@ halt no more be ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty because of my hol@@ y mountain .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel shall not do in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful ton@@ gue be found in their m@@ outh : for they shall fe@@ ed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the Lord hat@@ h taken away TH@@ Y judg@@ ments , he hat@@ h cast out th@@ ine enemy : the king of Israel , even the Lord , is in the mid@@ st of the@@ e : th@@ ou s@@ halt not see ev@@ il any more .
in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t un@@ to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , saying ,
Y@@ e have so@@ wn much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clo@@ the you , but there is none warm ; and he that ear@@ net@@ h wages ear@@ net@@ h wages to put it into a bag with ho@@ les .
and I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the cor@@ n , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground br@@ ing@@ eth forth , and upon men , and upon c@@ attle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
then Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , with all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , obe@@ yed the voice of the Lord their God , and the words of Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , as the Lord their God had sent him , and the people did fear before the Lord .
in the seventh month , in the one and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the month , came the word of the Lord by the pro@@ phe@@ t Hag@@ ga@@ i , saying ,
speak now to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua the son of Jos@@ ede@@ ch , the high pri@@ est , and to the resi@@ due of the people , saying ,
consider now from this day and up@@ ward , from the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temp@@ le was laid , consider it .
and I will overthrow the th@@ r@@ one of k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms , and I will destroy the strength of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the he@@ a@@ then ; and I will overthrow the char@@ i@@ ots , and those that ride in them ; and the hor@@ ses and their ri@@ ders shall come down , every one by the s@@ word of his brother .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
upon the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the ele@@ venth month , which is the month S@@ eb@@ at , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , came the word of the Lord un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
I saw by night , and be@@ hold a man ri@@ ding upon a red hor@@ se , and he stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red hor@@ ses , spec@@ k@@ led , and white .
and they answ@@ ered the an@@ gel of the Lord that stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees , and said , We have walked to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th , and , be@@ hold , all the ear@@ th sit@@ te@@ th still , and is at rest .
and many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of the@@ e , and th@@ ou s@@ halt know that the Lord of hosts hat@@ h sent me un@@ to the@@ e .
and he answ@@ ered and sp@@ ake un@@ to those that stood before him , saying , T@@ ake away the fil@@ thy gar@@ ments from him . and un@@ to him he said , be@@ hold , I have caused th@@ ine in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to pass from the@@ e , and I will clo@@ the the@@ e with change of ra@@ im@@ ent .
and , be@@ hold , there was lifted up a tal@@ ent of lead : and this is a woman that sit@@ te@@ th in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their w@@ ings ; for they had w@@ ings like the w@@ ings of a stor@@ k : and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h between the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , there came four char@@ i@@ ots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of br@@ ass .
and the bay went forth , and sought to go that they might walk to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th : and he said , G@@ et you hence , walk to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th . so they walked to and f@@ ro through the ear@@ th .
take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , which are come from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and come th@@ ou the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah ;
and speak un@@ to him , saying , Th@@ us speak@@ eth the Lord of hosts , saying , be@@ hold the man whose name is The branch ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temp@@ le of the Lord :
even he shall build the temp@@ le of the Lord ; and he shall bear the gl@@ ory , and shall sit and rule upon his th@@ r@@ one ; and he shall be a pri@@ est upon his th@@ r@@ one : and the coun@@ sel of peace shall be between them both .
and the crow@@ ns shall be to H@@ ele@@ m , and to To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and to J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , and to H@@ en the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , for a memorial in the temp@@ le of the Lord .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Dar@@ i@@ us , that the word of the Lord came un@@ to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u ;
speak un@@ to all the people of the land , and to the pri@@ ests , saying , When ye fas@@ ted and mour@@ ned in the fifth and seventh month , even those sev@@ enty years , did ye at all fast un@@ to me , even to me ?
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and drink for yo@@ ur@@ selves ?
thus sa@@ ith the Lord ; I am returned un@@ to Z@@ ion , and will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Jer@@ usalem : and Jer@@ usalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the hol@@ y mountain .
for before these days there was no h@@ ire for man , nor any h@@ ire for be@@ ast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the aff@@ li@@ ction : for I set all men every one against his neighbour .
for the se@@ ed shall be prosperous ; the v@@ ine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heav@@ ens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the re@@ mn@@ ant of this people to poss@@ ess all these things .
the burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and Dam@@ as@@ cus shall be the rest there@@ of : when the eyes of man , as of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , shall be toward the Lord .
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , and E@@ kr@@ on ; for her expec@@ tation shall be as@@ ha@@ med ; and the king shall per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and I will en@@ camp about mine house because of the army , because of him that pass@@ eth by , and because of him that retur@@ net@@ h : and no op@@ pres@@ sor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
and the Lord shall be seen over them , and his ar@@ row shall go forth as the ligh@@ t@@ ning : and the Lord God shall blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , and shall go with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a cro@@ wn , lifted up as an en@@ sign upon his land .
ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the Lord shall make bright cl@@ ou@@ ds , and give them sho@@ wers of rain , to every one gr@@ ass in the field .
and they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , which tre@@ ad down their enem@@ ies in the m@@ ire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses shall be con@@ founded .
and I will strengthen the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them again to place them ; for I have mer@@ cy upon them : and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am the Lord their God , and will hear them .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and L@@ aban@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
and he shall pass through the sea with aff@@ li@@ ction , and shall sm@@ ite the waves in the sea , and all the deep@@ s of the river shall d@@ ry up : and the pride of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a shall be brought down , and the scep@@ tre of Egypt shall de@@ part away .
then said I , I will not fe@@ ed you : that that di@@ eth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the f@@ les@@ h of another .
and the Lord said un@@ to me , cast it un@@ to the P@@ ot@@ ter : a good@@ ly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the P@@ ot@@ ter in the house of the Lord .
in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will sm@@ ite every hor@@ se with ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , and his Ri@@ der with mad@@ ness : and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Ju@@ da@@ h , and will sm@@ ite every hor@@ se of the people with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness .
in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem ; and he that is fe@@ e@@ ble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the an@@ gel of the Lord before them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts , that I will cut off the names of the id@@ ols out of the land , and they shall no more be remember@@ ed : and also I will cause the pro@@ ph@@ ets and the un@@ clean spirit to pass out of the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall be as@@ ha@@ med every one of his vision , when he hat@@ h pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied ; neither shall they wear a roug@@ h gar@@ ment to dec@@ e@@ ive :
for I will gather all nations against Jer@@ usalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rif@@ led , and the women ra@@ vis@@ hed ; and half of the city shall go forth into cap@@ tivity , and the resi@@ due of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hin@@ der sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and this shall be the pla@@ gue where@@ with the Lord will sm@@ ite all the people that have fought against Jer@@ usalem ; The@@ ir f@@ les@@ h shall consum@@ e away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consum@@ e away in their ho@@ les , and their ton@@ gue shall consum@@ e away in their m@@ outh .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great t@@ um@@ ult from the Lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
and so shall be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the ass , and of all the be@@ asts that shall be in these ten@@ ts , as this pla@@ gue .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jer@@ usalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ ac@@ les .
and it shall be , that wh@@ os@@ o will not come up of all the families of the ear@@ th un@@ to Jer@@ usalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
but ye have prof@@ an@@ ed it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is pollu@@ ted ; and the fruit there@@ of , even his meat , is con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble .
be@@ hold , I will send my mes@@ sen@@ ger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall su@@ d@@ den@@ ly come to this temp@@ le , even the mes@@ sen@@ ger of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , whom ye de@@ light in : be@@ hold , he shall come , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
and he shall sit as a refin@@ er and pur@@ if@@ er of silver : and he shall pur@@ ify the sons of L@@ evi , and pur@@ ge them as gold and silver , that they may offer un@@ to the Lord an offering in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
and I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast her fruit before the time in the field , sa@@ ith the Lord of hosts .
then they that fear@@ ed the Lord sp@@ ake often one to another : and the Lord hear@@ ken@@ ed , and heard it , and a book of re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance was written before him for them that fear@@ ed the Lord , and that thought upon his name .
when they had heard the king , they depar@@ ted ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , ti@@ ll it came and stood over where the young child was .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and wor@@ shi@@ pped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented un@@ to him gifts ; gold , and fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus did reign in Ju@@ da@@ ea in the room of his father Her@@ od , he was afraid to go th@@ ither : no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Gal@@ il@@ ee :
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
and J@@ es@@ us , when he was b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed , went up stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay out of the water : and , lo , the heav@@ ens were opened un@@ to him , and he saw the Spiri@@ t of God des@@ cen@@ ding like a do@@ ve , and ligh@@ ting upon him :
and his f@@ ame went throughout all Syria : and they brought un@@ to him all si@@ ck people that were taken with di@@ vers diseases and tor@@ ments , and those which were poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils , and those which were lun@@ ati@@ ck , and those that had the pal@@ sy ; and he he@@ aled them .
Y@@ e are the salt of the ear@@ th : but if the salt have lost his sav@@ our , where@@ with shall it be sal@@ ted ? it is th@@ en@@ ce@@ forth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be tro@@ dden under fo@@ ot of men .
Y@@ e have heard that it was said by them of old time , T@@ ho@@ u s@@ halt not kill ; and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
but I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say to his brother , R@@ aca , shall be in danger of the council : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say , T@@ ho@@ u fo@@ ol , shall be in danger of hell fire .
agree with th@@ ine ad@@ versary quickly , wh@@ il@@ es th@@ ou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the ad@@ versary deliver the@@ e to the judge , and the judge deliver the@@ e to the officer , and th@@ ou be cast into prison .
and if TH@@ Y right eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from the@@ e : for it is profitable for the@@ e that one of TH@@ Y members should per@@ ish , and not that TH@@ Y whole body should be cast into hell .
and if TH@@ Y right hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut if off , and cast it from the@@ e : for it is profitable for the@@ e that one of TH@@ Y members should per@@ ish , and not that TH@@ Y whole body should be cast into hell .
but I say un@@ to you , Lo@@ ve your enem@@ ies , b@@ less them that cur@@ se you , do good to them that h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for them which desp@@ ite@@ fully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
but th@@ ou , when th@@ ou pray@@ est , enter into TH@@ Y clos@@ et , and when th@@ ou h@@ ast shut TH@@ Y door , pra@@ y to TH@@ Y F@@ ather which is in secret ; and TH@@ Y F@@ ather which se@@ eth in secret shall reward the@@ e openly .
and every one that he@@ aret@@ h these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them not , shall be lik@@ ened un@@ to a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , which built his house upon the s@@ and :
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Ger@@ ges@@ en@@ es , there met him two poss@@ essed with dev@@ ils , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and he said un@@ to them , G@@ o . and when they were come out , they went into the her@@ d of sw@@ ine : and , be@@ hold , the whole her@@ d of sw@@ ine ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the sea , and per@@ ished in the waters .
and , be@@ hold , they brought to him a man si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy , lying on a bed : and J@@ es@@ us seeing their faith said un@@ to the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy ; Son , be of good che@@ er ; TH@@ Y sin@@ s be for@@ given the@@ e .
but when he saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , he was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion on them , because they fa@@ in@@ ted , and were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad , as she@@ ep having no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , ti@@ ll the Son of man be come .
it is enough for the dis@@ cip@@ le that he be as his master , and the ser@@ vant as his lor@@ d . if they have called the master of the house Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bu@@ b , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
for I am come to set a man at vari@@ ance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give to drink un@@ to one of these little ones a c@@ up of cold water only in the name of a dis@@ cip@@ le , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
the b@@ lin@@ d receive their sight , and the la@@ me walk , the le@@ pers are cleans@@ ed , and the de@@ af hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached to them .
and th@@ ou , Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , which art ex@@ al@@ ted un@@ to heav@@ en , s@@ halt be brought down to hell : for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works , which have been done in the@@ e , had been done in So@@ dom , it would have remained until this day .
how he entered into the house of God , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which was not law@@ ful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the pri@@ ests ?
and he said un@@ to them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one she@@ ep , and if it fall into a p@@ it on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth a word against the Son of man , it shall be for@@ given him : but wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever speak@@ eth against the Holy gh@@ ost , it shall not be for@@ given him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
for this people 's heart is wa@@ xed gross , and their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and should understand with their heart , and should be conver@@ ted , and I should he@@ al them .
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That many pro@@ ph@@ ets and righ@@ te@@ ous men have desi@@ red to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
when any one he@@ aret@@ h the word of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and under@@ stan@@ de@@ th it not , then co@@ me@@ th the w@@ ic@@ ked one , and cat@@ ch@@ eth away that which was so@@ wn in his heart . this is he which received se@@ ed by the way side .
again , the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en is like un@@ to treasure hi@@ d in a field ; the which when a man hat@@ h found , he hi@@ de@@ th , and for joy there@@ of go@@ eth and sel@@ le@@ th all that he hat@@ h , and bu@@ yet@@ h that field .
and he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tude to sit down on the gr@@ ass , and took the five lo@@ aves , and the two fis@@ hes , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed , and br@@ ake , and gave the lo@@ aves to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tude .
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought un@@ to him all that were dis@@ eased ;
In@@ som@@ u@@ ch that the multi@@ tude won@@ dered , when they saw the dum@@ b to speak , the ma@@ imed to be whole , the la@@ me to walk , and the b@@ lin@@ d to see : and they gl@@ ori@@ fied the God of Israel .
and in the morning , It will be f@@ oul weather to day : for the sky is red and low@@ ring . O ye hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes , ye can dis@@ cer@@ n the face of the sky ; but can ye not dis@@ cer@@ n the signs of the times ?
and if th@@ ine eye off@@ end the@@ e , p@@ lu@@ ck it out , and cast it from the@@ e : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred she@@ ep , and one of them be gone as@@ tra@@ y , do@@ th he not leave the n@@ in@@ ety and nine , and go@@ eth into the mountains , and seek@@ eth that which is gone as@@ tra@@ y ?
and if he shall neglec@@ t to hear them , tell it un@@ to the church : but if he neglec@@ t to hear the church , let him be un@@ to the@@ e as an he@@ a@@ then man and a pub@@ lican .
but for@@ as@@ much as he had not to pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
for there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were so born from their mother 's w@@ om@@ b : and there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s of men : and there be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which have made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the k@@ ing@@ dom of heav@@ en 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
and again I say un@@ to you , It is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through the eye of a ne@@ ed@@ le , than for a rich man to enter into the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
but J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and said , Y@@ e know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the c@@ up that I shall drink of , and to be b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with the b@@ ap@@ tism that I am b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed with ? they say un@@ to him , We are able .
and J@@ es@@ us went into the temp@@ le of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the mon@@ ey@@ chan@@ gers , and the seats of them that sold d@@ ov@@ es ,
now there were with us seven bre@@ th@@ ren : and the first , when he had married a wife , dec@@ eased , and , having no issue , left his wife un@@ to his brother :
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , be@@ hold , I send un@@ to you pro@@ ph@@ ets , and wise men , and s@@ cri@@ bes : and some of them ye shall kill and cru@@ ci@@ fy ; and some of them shall ye s@@ cour@@ ge in your syn@@ ago@@ gues , and persec@@ ute them from city to city :
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heav@@ en : and then shall all the tri@@ bes of the ear@@ th mour@@ n , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the cl@@ ou@@ ds of heav@@ en with power and great gl@@ ory .
for as in the days that were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k ,
then assemb@@ led together the chief pri@@ ests , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people , un@@ to the palace of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has ,
and , be@@ hold , one of them which were with J@@ es@@ us stret@@ ched out his hand , and drew his s@@ word , and struck a ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est 's , and smo@@ te off his e@@ ar .
and after that they had mo@@ cked him , they took the ro@@ be off from him , and put his own ra@@ im@@ ent on him , and led him away to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and par@@ ted his gar@@ ments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the pro@@ phe@@ t , They par@@ ted my gar@@ ments among them , and upon my ves@@ ture did they cast lots .
now when they were going , be@@ hold , some of the watch came into the city , and she@@ wed un@@ to the chief pri@@ ests all the things that were done .
and when he had gone a little further th@@ ence , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , who also were in the ship men@@ ding their n@@ ets .
and when they could not come n@@ igh un@@ to him for the press , they uncovered the ro@@ of where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the si@@ ck of the pal@@ sy lay .
and it came to pass , that he went through the cor@@ n fields on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les began , as they went , to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of cor@@ n .
how he went into the house of God in the days of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the high pri@@ est , and did eat the she@@ w@@ bread , which is not law@@ ful to eat but for the pri@@ ests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and when he had looked round about on them with an@@ ger , being gri@@ ev@@ ed for the hard@@ ness of their hear@@ ts , he sa@@ ith un@@ to the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand . and he stret@@ ched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and sp@@ oil his goods , except he will first bin@@ d the strong man ; and then he will sp@@ oil his house .
and he began again to te@@ ach by the sea side : and there was gathered un@@ to him a great multi@@ tude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multi@@ tude was by the sea on the land .
and it came to pass , as he so@@ wed , some fell by the way side , and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air came and dev@@ oured it up .
that seeing they may see , and not perce@@ ive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be conver@@ ted , and their sin@@ s should be for@@ given them .
because that he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been p@@ lu@@ cked as@@ under by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces : neither could any man t@@ ame him .
and for@@ th@@ with J@@ es@@ us gave them leave . and the un@@ clean spir@@ its went out , and entered into the sw@@ ine : and the her@@ d ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were ch@@ oked in the sea .
and they that f@@ ed the sw@@ ine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to J@@ es@@ us , and see him that was poss@@ essed with the dev@@ il , and had the Legi@@ on , sitting , and clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they la@@ ug@@ hed him to scor@@ n . but when he had put them all out , he tak@@ eth the father and the mother of the dam@@ sel , and them that were with him , and enter@@ eth in where the dam@@ sel was lying .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye de@@ part th@@ ence , shake off the d@@ ust under your feet for a testimony against them . Ver@@ ily I say un@@ to you , It shall be more toler@@ able for So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
and J@@ es@@ us , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion toward them , because they were as she@@ ep not having a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : and he began to te@@ ach them many things .
and when he had taken the five lo@@ aves and the two fis@@ hes , he looked up to heav@@ en , and b@@ les@@ sed , and br@@ ake the lo@@ aves , and gave them to his dis@@ cip@@ les to set before them ; and the two fis@@ hes divided he among them all .
for lay@@ ing aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the w@@ ashing of po@@ ts and c@@ ups : and many other such like things ye do .
and from th@@ ence he ar@@ ose , and went into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hi@@ d .
and he comman@@ ded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven lo@@ aves , and gave thanks , and br@@ ake , and gave to his dis@@ cip@@ les to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and he began to te@@ ach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the el@@ ders , and of the chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and when he had called the people un@@ to him with his dis@@ cip@@ les also , he said un@@ to them , W@@ hos@@ o@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , ti@@ ll the Son of man were risen from the dead .
for he ta@@ ught his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said un@@ to them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Ch@@ r@@ ist , veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , he shall not lose his reward .
and if TH@@ Y hand off@@ end the@@ e , cut it off : it is better for the@@ e to enter into life ma@@ imed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and if TH@@ Y fo@@ ot off@@ end the@@ e , cut it off : it is better for the@@ e to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and he ar@@ ose from th@@ ence , and co@@ me@@ th into the co@@ asts of Ju@@ da@@ ea by the far@@ ther side of Jordan : and the people resort un@@ to him again ; and , as he was won@@ t , he ta@@ ught them again .
and J@@ es@@ us entered into Jer@@ usalem , and into the temp@@ le : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the ev@@ enti@@ de was come , he went out un@@ to B@@ eth@@ any with the twelve .
and seeing a fi@@ g tree af@@ ar off having leaves , he came , if hap@@ ly he might find any thing there@@ on : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of fig@@ s was not yet .
and they come to Jer@@ usalem : and J@@ es@@ us went into the temp@@ le , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temp@@ le , and over@@ threw the tables of the mon@@ ey@@ chan@@ gers , and the seats of them that sold d@@ ov@@ es ;
for veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , That wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall say un@@ to this mountain , Be th@@ ou removed , and be th@@ ou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he sa@@ ith shall come to pass ; he shall have wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he sa@@ ith .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? but he , kno@@ wing their hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y , said un@@ to them , Wh@@ y temp@@ t ye me ? bring me a pen@@ ny , that I may see it .
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the an@@ gel@@ s which are in heav@@ en .
and as tou@@ ching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Mos@@ es , how in the b@@ ush God sp@@ ake un@@ to him , saying , I am the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b ?
and th@@ ou s@@ halt love the Lord TH@@ Y God with all TH@@ Y heart , and with all TH@@ Y sou@@ l , and with all TH@@ Y mind , and with all TH@@ Y strength : this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the sou@@ l , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
but when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought be@@ fore@@ hand what ye shall speak , neither do ye pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ate : but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy gh@@ ost .
now the brother shall bet@@ ray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
but when ye shall see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , spoken of by Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing where it ought not , ( let him that re@@ ade@@ th understand , ) then let them that be in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains :
for the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and comman@@ ded the Por@@ ter to watch .
after two days was the feast of the pass@@ over , and of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread : and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
and he bought fine lin@@ en , and took him down , and wrapped him in the lin@@ en , and laid him in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re which was he@@ wn out of a rock , and rol@@ led a stone un@@ to the door of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
there was in the days of Her@@ od , the king of Ju@@ da@@ ea , a certain pri@@ est named Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , of the course of A@@ bia : and his wife was of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Aaron , and her name was E@@ lis@@ ab@@ eth .
for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , even from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b .
and , be@@ hold , th@@ ou s@@ halt be dum@@ b , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because th@@ ou believ@@ est not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his minist@@ ration were accomplished , he depar@@ ted to his own house .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of his father .
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ il@@ ee , out of the city of N@@ azar@@ eth , into Ju@@ da@@ ea , un@@ to the city of David , which is called B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem ; ( because he was of the house and lin@@ e@@ age of David : )
and it came to pass , as the an@@ gel@@ s were gone away from them into heav@@ en , the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds said one to another , Let us now go even un@@ to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hat@@ h made known un@@ to us .
and , be@@ hold , there was a man in Jer@@ usalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out , waiting for the con@@ so@@ lation of Israel : and the Holy gh@@ ost was upon him .
and it was revealed un@@ to him by the Holy gh@@ ost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us Ca@@ es@@ ar , Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate being governor of Ju@@ da@@ ea , and Her@@ od being te@@ tr@@ arch of Gal@@ il@@ ee , and his brother Philip te@@ tr@@ arch of I@@ tur@@ a@@ ea and of the region of T@@ rac@@ hon@@ itis , and Ly@@ san@@ ias the te@@ tr@@ arch of A@@ bil@@ ene ,
and now also the ax@@ e is laid un@@ to the root of the trees : every tree therefore which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
which was the son of Mat@@ that , which was the son of L@@ evi , which was the son of Mel@@ chi , which was the son of Jan@@ na , which was the son of Joseph ,
which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ ias , which was the son of Am@@ os , which was the son of Na@@ um , which was the son of Es@@ li , which was the son of Nag@@ ge ,
which was the son of M@@ aat@@ h , which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ ias , which was the son of Se@@ me@@ i , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of J@@ uda ,
which was the son of Mel@@ chi , which was the son of Ad@@ di , which was the son of Cos@@ am , which was the son of El@@ mo@@ dam , which was the son of E@@ R ,
which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eli@@ ez@@ er , which was the son of Jor@@ im , which was the son of Mat@@ that , which was the son of L@@ evi ,
which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of J@@ uda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jon@@ an , which was the son of Eli@@ ak@@ im ,
which was the son of M@@ ele@@ a , which was the son of Men@@ an , which was the son of Mat@@ ta@@ th@@ a , which was the son of Na@@ than , which was the son of David ,
which was the son of J@@ es@@ se , which was the son of Ob@@ ed , which was the son of Bo@@ oz , which was the son of sal@@ mon , which was the son of Na@@ as@@ son ,
which was the son of A@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b , which was the son of Ara@@ m , which was the son of Es@@ rom , which was the son of P@@ har@@ es , which was the son of J@@ uda ,
which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an , which was the son of Ar@@ p@@ ha@@ x@@ ad , which was the son of Se@@ m , which was the son of No@@ e , which was the son of La@@ me@@ ch ,
which was the son of M@@ ath@@ us@@ ala , which was the son of E@@ no@@ ch , which was the son of Jar@@ ed , which was the son of Mal@@ ele@@ el , which was the son of C@@ ain@@ an ,
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the syn@@ ago@@ gue were fas@@ tened on him .
and rose up , and th@@ rust him out of the city , and led him un@@ to the bro@@ w of the hill where@@ on their city was built , that they might cast him down head@@ long .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any si@@ ck with di@@ vers diseases brought them un@@ to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
and he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and pray@@ ed him that he would th@@ rust out a little from the land . and he sat down , and ta@@ ught the people out of the ship .
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multi@@ tude , they went upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and let him down through the ti@@ ling with his cou@@ ch into the mid@@ st before J@@ es@@ us .
and it came to pass on the second sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath after the first , that he went through the cor@@ n fields ; and his dis@@ cip@@ les p@@ lu@@ cked the e@@ ars of cor@@ n , and did eat , rub@@ bing them in their hands .
how he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the she@@ w@@ bread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not law@@ ful to eat but for the pri@@ ests alone ?
and un@@ to him that sm@@ ite@@ th the@@ e on the one che@@ ek offer also the other ; and him that tak@@ eth away TH@@ Y clo@@ ke for@@ bid not to take TH@@ Y co@@ at also .
give , and it shall be given un@@ to you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bos@@ om . for with the same measure that ye M@@ ete with@@ al it shall be meas@@ ured to you again .
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth that which is good ; and an ev@@ il man out of the ev@@ il treasure of his heart br@@ ing@@ eth forth that which is ev@@ il : for of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart his m@@ outh speak@@ eth .
now when he came n@@ igh to the gate of the city , be@@ hold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a wi@@ dow : and much people of the city was with her .
they are like un@@ to children sitting in the market@@ place , and calling one to another , and saying , We have pip@@ ed un@@ to you , and ye have not dan@@ ced ; we have mour@@ ned to you , and ye have not we@@ pt .
and that which fell among thor@@ ns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are ch@@ oked with car@@ es and ri@@ ches and pleas@@ ures of this life , and bring no fruit to perf@@ ection .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his dis@@ cip@@ les : and he said un@@ to them , Let us go over un@@ to the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had dev@@ ils long time , and w@@ are no clo@@ th@@ es , neither abo@@ de in any house , but in the tom@@ bs .
then went the dev@@ ils out of the man , and entered into the sw@@ ine : and the her@@ d ran viol@@ ently down a steep place into the lake , and were ch@@ oked .
and , be@@ hold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue : and he fell down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and bes@@ ought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hi@@ d , she came tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , and falling down before him , she declared un@@ to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was he@@ aled immediately .
for wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he shall come in his own gl@@ ory , and in his F@@ ather 's , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but he turned , and re@@ bu@@ ked them , and said , Y@@ e know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
and on the mor@@ row when he depar@@ ted , he took out two p@@ ence , and gave them to the host , and said un@@ to him , T@@ ake care of him ; and wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever th@@ ou sp@@ en@@ dest more , when I come again , I will repay the@@ e .
and he said un@@ to them , When ye pra@@ y , say , Our F@@ ather which art in heav@@ en , H@@ allowed be TH@@ Y name . TH@@ Y k@@ ing@@ dom come . TH@@ Y will be done , as in heav@@ en , so in ear@@ th .
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a ser@@ p@@ ent ?
and he was casting out a dev@@ il , and it was dum@@ b . and it came to pass , when the dev@@ il was gone out , the dum@@ b sp@@ ake ; and the people won@@ dered .
and it came to pass , as he sp@@ ake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said un@@ to him , b@@ les@@ sed is the w@@ om@@ b that b@@ are the@@ e , and the pap@@ s which th@@ ou h@@ ast suc@@ ked .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when th@@ ine eye is single , TH@@ Y whole body also is full of light ; but when th@@ ine eye is ev@@ il , TH@@ Y body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
in the mean time , when there were gathered together an in@@ num@@ er@@ able multi@@ tude of people , ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch that they tro@@ de one upon another , he began to say un@@ to his dis@@ cip@@ les first of all , be@@ w@@ are ye of the le@@ av@@ en of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , which is hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be for@@ given him : but un@@ to him that b@@ las@@ phe@@ me@@ th against the Holy gh@@ ost it shall not be for@@ given .
if then God so clo@@ the the gr@@ ass , which is to day in the field , and to mor@@ row is cast into the ov@@ en ; how much more will he clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
b@@ les@@ sed are those servants , whom the lor@@ d when he co@@ me@@ th shall find watching : veril@@ y I say un@@ to you , that he shall gir@@ d himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and this know , that if the Go@@ od@@ man of the house had known what hour the th@@ i@@ ef would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
the father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
it is like a gra@@ in of mu@@ st@@ ard se@@ ed , which a man took , and cast into his gar@@ den ; and it grew , and wa@@ xed a great tree ; and the fo@@ w@@ ls of the air lo@@ d@@ ged in the branches of it .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
and he ar@@ ose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had comp@@ as@@ sion , and ran , and fell on his nec@@ k , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
and bes@@ ide all this , between us and you there is a great gul@@ f fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you can@@ not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from th@@ ence .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , that ligh@@ ten@@ eth out of the one part under heav@@ en , sh@@ in@@ eth un@@ to the other part under heav@@ en ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
they did eat , they d@@ rank , they married wi@@ ves , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the Ar@@ k , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he which shall be upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and his stu@@ ff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
and it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the k@@ ing@@ dom , then he comman@@ ded these servants to be called un@@ to him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
and it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he ta@@ ught the people in the temp@@ le , and pre@@ ached the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes came upon him with the el@@ ders ,
then let them which are in Ju@@ da@@ ea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the mid@@ st of it de@@ part out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter there@@ into .
and they shall fall by the edge of the s@@ word , and shall be led away cap@@ tive into all nations : and Jer@@ usalem shall be tro@@ dden down of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , until the times of the Gen@@ ti@@ les be fulfilled .
men 's hear@@ ts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the ear@@ th : for the powers of heav@@ en shall be shaken .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temp@@ le ; and at night he went out , and abo@@ de in the mount that is called the mount of ol@@ ives .
and when Her@@ od saw J@@ es@@ us , he was exceeding glad : for he was desi@@ ro@@ us to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some mir@@ acle done by him .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cy@@ ren@@ ian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after J@@ es@@ us .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Cal@@ v@@ ary , there they cru@@ ci@@ fied him , and the mal@@ ef@@ actors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , this IS the King of the Jews .
( the same had not consen@@ ted to the coun@@ sel and de@@ ed of them ; ) he was of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a city of the Jews : who also himself w@@ aited for the k@@ ing@@ dom of God .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came un@@ to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , bringing the sp@@ ices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and b@@ les@@ sed it , and br@@ ake , and gave to them .
and the Wor@@ d was made f@@ les@@ h , and d@@ wel@@ t among us , ( and we be@@ held his gl@@ ory , the gl@@ ory as of the only be@@ gotten of the F@@ ather , ) full of grace and truth .
and I knew him not : but he that sent me to b@@ ap@@ ti@@ ze with water , the same said un@@ to me , U@@ p@@ on whom th@@ ou s@@ halt see the Spiri@@ t des@@ cen@@ ding , and remaining on him , the same is he which b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ eth with the Holy gh@@ ost .
and when he had made a s@@ cour@@ ge of small cor@@ ds , he dro@@ ve them all out of the temp@@ le , and the she@@ ep , and the ox@@ en ; and p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw the tables ;
the wind b@@ low@@ eth where it liste@@ th , and th@@ ou hear@@ est the sound there@@ of , but can@@ st not tell wh@@ ence it co@@ me@@ th , and w@@ hi@@ ther it go@@ eth : so is every one that is born of the Spiri@@ t .
and no man hat@@ h as@@ cen@@ ded up to heav@@ en , but he that came down from heav@@ en , even the Son of man which is in heav@@ en .
when he heard that J@@ es@@ us was come out of Ju@@ da@@ ea into Gal@@ il@@ ee , he went un@@ to him , and bes@@ ought him that he would come down , and he@@ al his son : for he was at the point of death .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that he@@ aret@@ h my word , and believ@@ eth on him that sent me , hat@@ h ever@@ lasting life , and shall not come into condem@@ nation ; but is passed from death un@@ to life .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
and J@@ es@@ us took the lo@@ aves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fis@@ hes as much as they would .
so when they had ro@@ wed about five and twenty or thirty fur@@ lon@@ gs , they see J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing n@@ igh un@@ to the ship : and they were afraid .
and this is the F@@ ather 's will which hat@@ h sent me , that of all which he hat@@ h given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which se@@ eth the Son , and believ@@ eth on him , may have ever@@ lasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
I am the living bread which came down from heav@@ en : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my f@@ les@@ h , which I will give for the life of the world .
then J@@ es@@ us said un@@ to them , Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , except ye eat the f@@ les@@ h of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
if a man on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day receive circum@@ c@@ ision , that the law of Mos@@ es should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every w@@ hit whole on the sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day ?
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own con@@ science , went out one by one , beginning at the el@@ dest , even un@@ to the last : and J@@ es@@ us was left alone , and the woman standing in the mid@@ st .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but J@@ es@@ us hi@@ d himself , and went out of the temp@@ le , going through the mid@@ st of them , and so passed by .
when he had thus spoken , he sp@@ at on the ground , and made cla@@ y of the sp@@ it@@ tle , and he ano@@ in@@ ted the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d man with the cla@@ y ,
these words sp@@ ake his parents , because they fear@@ ed the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did conf@@ ess that he was Ch@@ r@@ ist , he should be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that enter@@ eth not by the door into the she@@ ep@@ fold , but clim@@ bet@@ h up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
but he that is an hi@@ re@@ ling , and not the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , whose own the she@@ ep are not , se@@ eth the w@@ ol@@ f coming , and le@@ av@@ eth the she@@ ep , and fle@@ eth : and the w@@ ol@@ f cat@@ ch@@ eth them , and sc@@ at@@ ter@@ eth the she@@ ep .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comfor@@ ted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up has@@ ti@@ ly and went out , followed her , saying , S@@ he go@@ eth un@@ to the grave to we@@ ep there .
now both the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had given a comman@@ d@@ ment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should she@@ w it , that they might take him .
now before the feast of the pass@@ over , when J@@ es@@ us knew that his hour was come that he should de@@ part out of this world un@@ to the F@@ ather , having lov@@ ed his own which were in the world , he lov@@ ed them un@@ to the end .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered , He it is , to whom I shall give a So@@ p , when I have di@@ pped it . and when he had di@@ pped the So@@ p , he gave it to Ju@@ das Is@@ car@@ i@@ ot , the son of Simon .
Bel@@ i@@ ev@@ est th@@ ou not that I am in the F@@ ather , and the F@@ ather in me ? the words that I speak un@@ to you I speak not of myself : but the F@@ ather that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in me , he do@@ eth the works .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , He that believ@@ eth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go un@@ to my F@@ ather .
but the Com@@ for@@ ter , which is the Holy gh@@ ost , whom the F@@ ather will send in my name , he shall te@@ ach you all things , and bring all things to your re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever I have said un@@ to you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give un@@ to you : not as the world gi@@ vet@@ h , give I un@@ to you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
Y@@ e have heard how I said un@@ to you , I go away , and come again un@@ to you . if ye lov@@ ed me , ye would re@@ jo@@ ice , because I said , I go un@@ to the F@@ ather : for my F@@ ather is greater than I@@ .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
hen@@ ce@@ forth I call you not servants ; for the ser@@ vant know@@ eth not what his lor@@ d do@@ eth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my F@@ ather I have made known un@@ to you .
remember the word that I said un@@ to you , The ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d . if they have persec@@ uted me , they will also persec@@ ute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yo@@ urs also .
but when the Com@@ for@@ ter is come , whom I will send un@@ to you from the F@@ ather , even the Spiri@@ t of truth , which proce@@ ede@@ th from the F@@ ather , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not un@@ to you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedi@@ ent for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Com@@ for@@ ter will not come un@@ to you ; but if I de@@ part , I will send him un@@ to you .
H@@ ow@@ be@@ it when he , the Spiri@@ t of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will she@@ w you things to come .
now J@@ es@@ us knew that they were desi@@ ro@@ us to ask him , and said un@@ to them , D@@ o ye inqu@@ ire among yo@@ ur@@ selves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to you , That ye shall we@@ ep and la@@ ment , but the world shall re@@ jo@@ ice : and ye shall be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , but your sor@@ row shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in trav@@ ail hat@@ h sor@@ row , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remember@@ eth no more the an@@ gu@@ ish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
be@@ hold , the hour co@@ me@@ th , ye@@ a , is now come , that ye shall be sc@@ at@@ tered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the F@@ ather is with me .
for I have given un@@ to them the words which th@@ ou g@@ av@@ est me ; and they have received them , and have known su@@ rely that I came out from the@@ e , and they have believed that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st send me .
and now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to the@@ e . Holy F@@ ather , keep through th@@ ine own name those whom th@@ ou h@@ ast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
father , I will that they also , whom th@@ ou h@@ ast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may be@@ hold my gl@@ ory , which th@@ ou h@@ ast given me : for th@@ ou lov@@ ed@@ st me before the foundation of the world .
then led they J@@ es@@ us from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has un@@ to the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be def@@ iled ; but that they might eat the pass@@ over .
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard that saying , he brought J@@ es@@ us forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pav@@ ement , but in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a .
then she run@@ net@@ h , and co@@ me@@ th to Simon Peter , and to the other dis@@ cip@@ le , whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed , and sa@@ ith un@@ to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and we know not where they have laid him .
therefore that dis@@ cip@@ le whom J@@ es@@ us lov@@ ed sa@@ ith un@@ to Peter , It is the Lord . now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he gir@@ t his Fis@@ her 's co@@ at un@@ to him , ( for he was nak@@ ed , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
and the other dis@@ cip@@ les came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , ) dra@@ gging the net with fis@@ hes .
Ver@@ ily , veril@@ y , I say un@@ to the@@ e , When th@@ ou w@@ ast young , th@@ ou gir@@ de@@ d@@ st th@@ y@@ self , and walk@@ ed@@ st w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest : but when th@@ ou s@@ halt be old , th@@ ou s@@ halt stretch forth TH@@ Y hands , and another shall gir@@ d the@@ e , and carry the@@ e w@@ hi@@ ther th@@ ou wo@@ ul@@ dest not .
and there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , the which , if they should be written every one , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
and , being assemb@@ led together with them , comman@@ ded them that they should not de@@ part from Jer@@ usalem , but wait for the promise of the F@@ ather , which , sa@@ ith he , ye have heard of me .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy gh@@ ost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses un@@ to me both in Jer@@ usalem , and in all Ju@@ da@@ ea , and in Samar@@ ia , and un@@ to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the ear@@ th .
and when they were come in , they went up into an up@@ per room , where abo@@ de both Peter , and James , and John , and An@@ drew , Philip , and Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ olome@@ w , and Matthew , James the son of Alp@@ ha@@ e@@ us , and Simon Zel@@ o@@ tes , and Ju@@ das the brother of James .
and it was known un@@ to all the d@@ wel@@ lers at Jer@@ usalem ; ins@@ om@@ u@@ ch as that field is called in their proper ton@@ gue , A@@ cel@@ d@@ ama , that is to say , The field of blood .
therefore being a pro@@ phe@@ t , and kno@@ wing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his lo@@ ins , according to the f@@ les@@ h , he would raise up Ch@@ r@@ ist to sit on his th@@ r@@ one ;
and Ann@@ as the high pri@@ est , and C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kin@@ d@@ red of the high pri@@ est , were gathered together at Jer@@ usalem .
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , th@@ ou art God , which h@@ ast made heav@@ en , and ear@@ th , and the sea , and all that in them is :
and when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were assemb@@ led together ; and they were all filled with the Holy gh@@ ost , and they sp@@ ake the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the A@@ post@@ les , and beaten them , they comman@@ ded that they should not speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
I have seen , I have seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send the@@ e into Egypt .
this is that Mos@@ es , which said un@@ to the children of Israel , A pro@@ phe@@ t shall the Lord your God raise up un@@ to you of your bre@@ th@@ ren , like un@@ to me ; him shall ye hear .
for un@@ clean spir@@ its , cr@@ ying with l@@ oud voice , came out of many that were poss@@ essed with them : and many taken with pal@@ sies , and that were la@@ me , were he@@ aled .
and he tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling and ast@@ on@@ ished said , Lord , what w@@ il@@ t th@@ ou have me to do ? and the Lord said un@@ to him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told the@@ e what th@@ ou must do .
and when Sa@@ ul was come to Jer@@ usalem , he as@@ say@@ ed to join himself to the dis@@ cip@@ les : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a dis@@ cip@@ le .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was si@@ ck , and died : whom when they had was@@ hed , they laid her in an up@@ per chamber .
and saw heav@@ en opened , and a certain ves@@ sel des@@ cen@@ ding un@@ to him , as it had been a great she@@ et k@@ n@@ it at the four cor@@ ners , and let down to the ear@@ th :
now while Peter doub@@ ted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , be@@ hold , the men which were sent from Cor@@ neli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
send therefore to J@@ op@@ pa , and call hi@@ ther Simon , whose sur@@ name is Peter ; he is lo@@ d@@ ged in the house of one Simon a tan@@ ner by the sea side : who , when he co@@ me@@ th , shall speak un@@ to the@@ e .
then ti@@ dings of these things came un@@ to the e@@ ars of the church which was in Jer@@ usalem : and they sent forth Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , that he should go as far as Anti@@ o@@ ch .
now there were in the church that was at Anti@@ o@@ ch certain pro@@ ph@@ ets and teachers ; as Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , and Simeon that was called N@@ ig@@ er , and Lu@@ ci@@ us of Cy@@ ren@@ e , and Man@@ a@@ en , which had been brought up with Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch , and Sa@@ ul .
for they that d@@ well at Jer@@ usalem , and their rul@@ ers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which are read every sa@@ b@@ b@@ ath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
For@@ as@@ much as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , sub@@ ver@@ ting your so@@ ul@@ s , saying , Y@@ e must be circum@@ c@@ ised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such comman@@ d@@ ment :
then came he to Der@@ be and Ly@@ str@@ a : and , be@@ hold , a certain dis@@ cip@@ le was there , named Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , the son of a certain woman , which was a Je@@ w@@ ess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
and the keep@@ er of the prison aw@@ ak@@ ing out of his sle@@ ep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his s@@ word , and would have killed himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had been fled .
for as I passed by , and be@@ held your dev@@ o@@ tions , I found an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignor@@ antly worship , him declare I un@@ to you .
and hat@@ h made of one blood all nations of men for to d@@ well on all the face of the ear@@ th , and hat@@ h determined the times before appointed , and the bo@@ unds of their habi@@ tation ;
because he hat@@ h appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by that man whom he hat@@ h or@@ da@@ ined ; where@@ of he hat@@ h given assur@@ ance un@@ to all men , in that he hat@@ h raised him from the dead .
but b@@ ade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that co@@ me@@ th in Jer@@ usalem : but I will return again un@@ to you , if God will . and he sa@@ iled from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
and the whole city was filled with conf@@ usion : and having caught G@@ ai@@ us and Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , men of Macedonia , Paul 's compan@@ ions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
and we sa@@ iled th@@ ence , and came the next day over against Chi@@ os ; and the next day we arrived at Sam@@ os , and tar@@ ried at Tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ um ; and the next day we came to Mil@@ et@@ us .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he has@@ ted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jer@@ usalem the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a stra@@ ight course un@@ to Co@@ os , and the day following un@@ to R@@ ho@@ des , and from th@@ ence un@@ to Pat@@ ara :
now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sa@@ iled into Syria , and lan@@ ded at T@@ y@@ re : for there the ship was to un@@ la@@ de her burden .
and when we had accomplished those days , we depar@@ ted and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wi@@ ves and children , ti@@ ll we were out of the city : and we k@@ ne@@ eled down on the shore , and pray@@ ed .
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company depar@@ ted , and came un@@ to Ca@@ es@@ area : and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , which was one of the seven ; and abo@@ de with him .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temp@@ le , s@@ tir@@ red up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the st@@ airs , and bec@@ kon@@ ed with the hand un@@ to the people . and when there was made a great sil@@ ence , he sp@@ ake un@@ to them in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come n@@ igh un@@ to Dam@@ as@@ cus about noon , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ one from heav@@ en a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that sp@@ ake to me .
and when there ar@@ ose a great dis@@ sen@@ sion , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent stra@@ igh@@ tw@@ ay to the@@ e , and gave comman@@ d@@ ment to his acc@@ users also to say before the@@ e what they had against him . farewell .
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ kon@@ ed un@@ to him to speak , answ@@ ered , For@@ as@@ much as I know that th@@ ou h@@ ast been of many years a judge un@@ to this nation , I do the more che@@ er@@ fully answer for myself :
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jer@@ usalem stood round about , and laid many and gri@@ ev@@ ous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
and on the mor@@ row , when Agri@@ p@@ pa was come , and Bern@@ ice , with great pom@@ p , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief cap@@ tains , and principal men of the city , at F@@ es@@ tus ' comman@@ d@@ ment Paul was brought forth .
which thing I also did in Jer@@ usalem : and many of the sa@@ ints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
but rise , and stand upon TH@@ Y feet : for I have appeared un@@ to the@@ e for this purpose , to make the@@ e a minister and a witness both of these things which th@@ ou h@@ ast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear un@@ to the@@ e ;
and as the ship@@ men were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under col@@ our as though they would have cast an@@ ch@@ ors out of the fo@@ res@@ hip ,
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain cre@@ ek with a shore , into the which they were min@@ ded , if it were possible , to th@@ rust in the ship .
and when they had taken up the an@@ ch@@ ors , they committed themselves un@@ to the sea , and lo@@ os@@ ed the ru@@ d@@ der bands , and ho@@ ised up the main@@ sa@@ il to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship ag@@ round ; and the fore@@ part st@@ uck fast , and remained un@@ mov@@ eable , but the hin@@ der part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay si@@ ck of a f@@ ever and of a blo@@ ody f@@ lu@@ x : to whom Paul entered in , and pray@@ ed , and laid his hands on him , and he@@ aled him .
and when we came to Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to d@@ well by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for the heart of this people is wa@@ xed gross , and their e@@ ars are dul@@ l of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their e@@ ars , and understand with their heart , and should be conver@@ ted , and I should he@@ al them .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist : for it is the power of God un@@ to sal@@ vation to every one that believ@@ eth ; to the J@@ ew first , and also to the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eter@@ nal power and God@@ head ; so that they are without exc@@ use :
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not conven@@ i@@ ent ;
for when the Gen@@ ti@@ les , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law un@@ to themselves :
now we know that what things so@@ ever the law sa@@ ith , it sa@@ ith to them who are under the law : that every m@@ outh may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
for the promise , that he should be the he@@ ir of the world , was not to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , or to his se@@ ed , through the law , but through the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of faith .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ a 's w@@ om@@ b :
therefore we are buried with him by b@@ ap@@ tism into death : that like as Ch@@ r@@ ist was raised up from the dead by the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
know ye not , bre@@ th@@ ren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hat@@ h domin@@ ion over a man as long as he li@@ vet@@ h ?
for the woman which hat@@ h an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he li@@ vet@@ h ; but if the husband be dead , she is lo@@ os@@ ed from the law of her husband .
for I know that in me ( that is , in my f@@ les@@ h , ) d@@ wel@@ le@@ th no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to them which are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who walk not after the f@@ les@@ h , but after the Spiri@@ t .
for they that are after the f@@ les@@ h do mind the things of the f@@ les@@ h ; but they that are after the Spiri@@ t the things of the Spiri@@ t .
but ye are not in the f@@ les@@ h , but in the Spiri@@ t , if so be that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ well in you . now if any man have not the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is none of his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him that raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ well in you , he that raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist from the dead shall also quic@@ ken your mort@@ al bodies by his Spiri@@ t that d@@ wel@@ le@@ th in you .
moreover whom he did pre@@ dest@@ in@@ ate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also gl@@ ori@@ fied .
who is he that condem@@ net@@ h ? it is Ch@@ r@@ ist that died , ye@@ a rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also mak@@ eth inter@@ c@@ ession for us .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
for if th@@ ou w@@ ert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and w@@ ert gra@@ ff@@ ed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be gra@@ ff@@ ed into their own olive tree ?
for I would not , bre@@ th@@ ren , that ye should be ignor@@ ant of this my@@ ster@@ y , lest ye should be wise in your own conce@@ its ; that b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness in part is happened to Israel , until the ful@@ ness of the Gen@@ ti@@ les be come in .
he that regar@@ de@@ th the day , regar@@ de@@ th it un@@ to the Lord ; and he that regar@@ de@@ th not the day , to the Lord he do@@ th not regard it . he that e@@ ate@@ th , e@@ ate@@ th to the Lord , for he gi@@ vet@@ h God thanks ; and he that e@@ ate@@ th not , to the Lord he e@@ ate@@ th not , and gi@@ vet@@ h God thanks .
for whether we live , we live un@@ to the Lord ; and whether we die , we die un@@ to the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
nevertheless , bre@@ th@@ ren , I have written the more bol@@ dly un@@ to you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
and I am sure that , when I come un@@ to you , I shall come in the ful@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , for the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist 's sake , and for the love of the Spiri@@ t , that ye strive together with me in your pray@@ ers to God for me ;
for your obe@@ di@@ ence is come abroad un@@ to all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise un@@ to that which is good , and simple concerning ev@@ il .
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , bre@@ th@@ ren , by the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perf@@ ec@@ tly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it hat@@ h been declared un@@ to me of you , my bre@@ th@@ ren , by them which are of the house of Ch@@ lo@@ e , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
and base things of the world , and things which are desp@@ ised , hat@@ h God chosen , ye@@ a , and things which are not , to bring to n@@ ought things that are :
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
every man 's work shall be made manif@@ est : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
for who mak@@ eth the@@ e to differ from another ? and what h@@ ast th@@ ou that th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st not receive ? now if th@@ ou di@@ d@@ st receive it , why dost th@@ ou gl@@ ory , as if th@@ ou h@@ ad@@ st not received it ?
I speak to your sh@@ ame . is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his bre@@ th@@ ren ?
and such were some of you : but ye are was@@ hed , but ye are sanc@@ ti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and by the Spiri@@ t of our God .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temp@@ le of the Holy gh@@ ost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
but if any man think that he beha@@ vet@@ h himself un@@ co@@ mely toward his vir@@ gin , if she pass the f@@ lower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sin@@ net@@ h not : let them mar@@ ry .
nevertheless he that stan@@ de@@ th ste@@ d@@ fast in his heart , having no necess@@ ity , but hat@@ h power over his own will , and hat@@ h so decre@@ ed in his heart that he will keep his vir@@ gin , do@@ eth well .
but meat commen@@ de@@ th us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
who go@@ eth a war@@ fare any time at his own charges ? who plan@@ te@@ th a v@@ ine@@ yard , and e@@ ate@@ th not of the fruit there@@ of ? or who fe@@ ede@@ th a flock , and e@@ ate@@ th not of the milk of the flock ?
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done un@@ to me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my g@@ lor@@ ying vo@@ id .
what is my reward then ? Ver@@ ily that , when I pre@@ ach the g@@ os@@ p@@ el , I may make the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , that I abuse not my power in the g@@ os@@ p@@ el .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subj@@ ection : lest that by any means , when I have pre@@ ached to others , I myself should be a cas@@ ta@@ way .
moreover , bre@@ th@@ ren , I would not that ye should be ignor@@ ant , how that all our fa@@ thers were under the cl@@ oud , and all passed through the sea ;
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is it not the commun@@ ion of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is it not the commun@@ ion of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
but if any man say un@@ to you , This is offered in sacrifice un@@ to id@@ ols , eat not for his sake that she@@ wed it , and for con@@ science sake : for the ear@@ th is the Lord 's , and the ful@@ ness there@@ of :
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , for@@ as@@ much as he is the image and gl@@ ory of God : but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
when I was a child , I sp@@ ake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
I would that ye all sp@@ ake with ton@@ gues , but rather that ye pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied : for greater is he that pro@@ ph@@ es@@ i@@ eth than he that speak@@ eth with ton@@ gues , except he interpre@@ t , that the church may receive edi@@ fying .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
let your women keep sil@@ ence in the churches : for it is not per@@ mitted un@@ to them to speak ; but they are comman@@ ded to be under obe@@ di@@ ence , as also sa@@ ith the law .
as tou@@ ching our brother A@@ pol@@ los , I greatly desi@@ red him to come un@@ to you with the bre@@ th@@ ren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have conven@@ i@@ ent time .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist by the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , un@@ to the church of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints which are in all A@@ cha@@ ia :
who comfor@@ te@@ th us in all our tri@@ bu@@ lation , that we may be able to comfor@@ t them which are in any trouble , by the comfor@@ t where@@ with we ourselves are comfor@@ ted of God .
and whether we be aff@@ lic@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation , which is effec@@ tual in the en@@ during of the same suffer@@ ings which we also suffer : or whether we be comfor@@ ted , it is for your con@@ so@@ lation and sal@@ vation .
and I wrote this same un@@ to you , lest , when I came , I should have sor@@ row from them of whom I ought to re@@ jo@@ ice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
for out of much aff@@ li@@ ction and an@@ gu@@ ish of heart I wrote un@@ to you with many te@@ ars ; not that ye should be gri@@ ev@@ ed , but that ye might know the love which I have more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly un@@ to you .
For@@ as@@ much as ye are manif@@ est@@ ly declared to be the ep@@ ist@@ le of Ch@@ r@@ ist minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fle@@ sh@@ y tables of the heart .
and not as Mos@@ es , which put a v@@ ail over his face , that the children of Israel could not ste@@ d@@ f@@ ast@@ ly look to the end of that which is abolished :
in whom the go@@ d of this world hat@@ h b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of them which believe not , lest the light of the g@@ lor@@ ious g@@ os@@ p@@ el of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should sh@@ ine un@@ to them .
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al ; but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hat@@ h done , whether it be good or bad .
for we commen@@ d not ourselves again un@@ to you , but give you occasion to gl@@ ory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which gl@@ ory in appearance , and not in heart .
( for he sa@@ ith , I have heard the@@ e in a time accepted , and in the day of sal@@ vation have I succ@@ oured the@@ e : be@@ hold , now is the accepted time ; be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation . )
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore , though I wrote un@@ to you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear un@@ to you .
for if I have bo@@ asted any thing to him of you , I am not as@@ ha@@ med ; but as we sp@@ ake all things to you in truth , even so our bo@@ asting , which I made before Tit@@ us , is found a truth .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
whether any do inqu@@ ire of Tit@@ us , he is my partner and fel@@ lo@@ whel@@ per concerning you : or our bre@@ th@@ ren be inqu@@ ired of , they are the mes@@ sen@@ gers of the churches , and the gl@@ ory of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
do ye look on things after the ou@@ tw@@ ard appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , even so are we Ch@@ r@@ ist 's .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are ab@@ sent , such will we be also in de@@ ed when we are present .
not bo@@ asting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's la@@ bour@@ s ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be en@@ lar@@ ged by you according to our rule ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that where@@ in they gl@@ ory , they may be found even as we .
for ye suffer , if a man bring you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if a man dev@@ our you , if a man take of you , if a man ex@@ alt himself , if a man sm@@ ite you on the face .
in jour@@ ne@@ y@@ ings often , in per@@ ils of waters , in per@@ ils of rob@@ bers , in per@@ ils by mine own country@@ men , in per@@ ils by the he@@ a@@ then , in per@@ ils in the city , in per@@ ils in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in per@@ ils in the sea , in per@@ ils among false bre@@ th@@ ren ;
for though I would desire to gl@@ ory , I shall not be a fo@@ ol ; for I will say the truth : but now I for@@ bear , lest any man should think of me above that which he se@@ eth me to be , or that he he@@ aret@@ h of me .
and lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure through the ab@@ und@@ ance of the reve@@ lations , there was given to me a Th@@ or@@ n in the f@@ les@@ h , the mes@@ sen@@ ger of S@@ atan to bu@@ ff@@ et me , lest I should be ex@@ al@@ ted above measure .
but of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever they were , it mak@@ eth no matter to me : God accep@@ te@@ th no man 's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
and this I say , that the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , that was confirmed before of God in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , can@@ not dis@@ annul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
where is then the b@@ les@@ s@@ edn@@ ess ye sp@@ ake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have p@@ lu@@ cked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
that in the dis@@ pen@@ s@@ ation of the ful@@ ness of times he might gather together in one all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , both which are in heav@@ en , and which are on ear@@ th ; even in him :
in whom ye also tr@@ usted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the g@@ os@@ p@@ el of your sal@@ vation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that hol@@ y Spiri@@ t of promise ,
that at that time ye were without Ch@@ r@@ ist , being ali@@ ens from the com@@ mon@@ wealth of Israel , and st@@ ran@@ gers from the c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
ti@@ ll we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , un@@ to a perfect man , un@@ to the measure of the stat@@ ure of the ful@@ ness of Ch@@ r@@ ist :
that we hen@@ ce@@ forth be no more children , tos@@ sed to and f@@ ro , and carried about with every wind of doc@@ tr@@ ine , by the sle@@ ight of men , and c@@ un@@ ning craf@@ tin@@ ess , where@@ by they lie in wait to dec@@ e@@ ive ;
from whom the whole body f@@ it@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint supp@@ li@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body un@@ to the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
finally , bre@@ th@@ ren , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are true , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are honest , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are just , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are p@@ ure , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are lov@@ ely , wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever things are of good report ; if there be any vir@@ tu@@ e , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not ce@@ ase to pra@@ y for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wis@@ dom and spir@@ itual understanding ;
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconc@@ ile all things un@@ to himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in ear@@ th , or things in heav@@ en .
Paul , and Sil@@ van@@ us , and Tim@@ o@@ the@@ us , un@@ to the church of the Thessalon@@ ians which is in God the F@@ ather and in the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist : grace be un@@ to you , and peace , from God our F@@ ather , and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for our g@@ os@@ p@@ el came not un@@ to you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy gh@@ ost , and in much assur@@ ance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
for from you so@@ unded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith to God @@@ -@@ @ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
nor of men sought we gl@@ ory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been bur@@ den@@ some , as the A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now we command you , bre@@ th@@ ren , in the name of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that ye withdraw yo@@ ur@@ selves from every brother that walk@@ eth dis@@ or@@ derly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
W@@ her@@ e@@ un@@ to I am or@@ da@@ ined a pre@@ acher , and an A@@ pos@@ tle , ( I speak the truth in Ch@@ r@@ ist , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les in faith and ver@@ ity .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
if th@@ ou put the bre@@ th@@ ren in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of these things , th@@ ou s@@ halt be a good minister of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , no@@ ur@@ ished up in the words of faith and of good doc@@ tr@@ ine , where@@ un@@ to th@@ ou h@@ ast at@@ tained .
for this cause left I the@@ e in Cre@@ te , that th@@ ou sho@@ ul@@ dest set in order the things that are wan@@ ting , and or@@ da@@ in el@@ ders in every city , as I had appointed the@@ e :
T@@ ho@@ u h@@ ast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
W@@ her@@ e@@ fore in all things it beh@@ ov@@ ed him to be made like un@@ to his bre@@ th@@ ren , that he might be a mer@@ ci@@ ful and fa@@ ith@@ ful high pri@@ est in things per@@ taining to God , to make reconciliation for the sin@@ s of the people .
for the word of God is quick , and powerful , and shar@@ per than any t@@ wo@@ ed@@ ged s@@ word , pi@@ er@@ cing even to the dividing as@@ under of sou@@ l and spirit , and of the join@@ ts and mar@@ row , and is a dis@@ cer@@ ner of the th@@ ou@@ ghts and inten@@ ts of the heart .
and veril@@ y they that are of the sons of L@@ evi , who receive the office of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , have a comman@@ d@@ ment to take ti@@ th@@ es of the people according to the law , that is , of their bre@@ th@@ ren , though they come out of the lo@@ ins of Ab@@ ra@@ ham :
( for those pri@@ ests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said un@@ to him , The Lord sw@@ are and will not rep@@ ent , T@@ ho@@ u art a pri@@ est for ever after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ is@@ ede@@ c : )
for this is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hear@@ ts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and they shall not te@@ ach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , K@@ now the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as per@@ taining to the con@@ science ;
for when Mos@@ es had spoken every prec@@ ep@@ t to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of cal@@ ves and of go@@ ats , with water , and scar@@ let wo@@ ol , and hy@@ s@@ so@@ p , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led both the book , and all the people ,
through faith we understand that the wor@@ l@@ ds were fra@@ med by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance , obe@@ yed ; and he went out , not kno@@ wing w@@ hi@@ ther he went .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them af@@ ar off , and were persu@@ aded of them , and embrac@@ ed them , and conf@@ essed that they were st@@ ran@@ gers and pil@@ gri@@ ms on the ear@@ th .
and truly , if they had been min@@ d@@ ful of that country from wh@@ ence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
by faith Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hi@@ d three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of B@@ arak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ a@@ e ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the pro@@ ph@@ ets :
looking un@@ to J@@ es@@ us the author and fin@@ is@@ her of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising the sh@@ ame , and is set down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
( for they could not en@@ dur@@ e that which was comman@@ ded , An@@ d if so much as a be@@ ast touch the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned , or th@@ rust through with a d@@ art :
be not carried about with di@@ vers and st@@ range doc@@ tr@@ ines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with me@@ ats , which have not pro@@ fi@@ ted them that have been occupied there@@ in .
and the ton@@ gue is a fire , a world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : so is the ton@@ gue among our members , that it def@@ il@@ eth the whole body , and set@@ te@@ th on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
speak not ev@@ il one of another , bre@@ th@@ ren . he that speak@@ eth ev@@ il of his brother , and jud@@ get@@ h his brother , speak@@ eth ev@@ il of the law , and jud@@ get@@ h the law : but if th@@ ou judge the law , th@@ ou art not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
be@@ hold , the h@@ ire of the la@@ bour@@ ers who have re@@ ap@@ ed down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , cri@@ eth : and the cri@@ es of them which have re@@ ap@@ ed are entered into the e@@ ars of the Lord of sa@@ ba@@ o@@ th .

Eli@@ as was a man subject to like pas@@ sions as we are , and he pray@@ ed ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly that it might not rain : and it ra@@ ined not on the ear@@ th by the space of three years and six months .
for what gl@@ ory is it , if , when ye be bu@@ ffe@@ ted for your fa@@ ults , ye shall take it pati@@ ently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it pati@@ ently , this is acceptable with God .
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble , even the or@@ nament of a me@@ ek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask@@ eth you a reason of the hope that is in you with me@@ ek@@ ness and fear :
for for this cause was the g@@ os@@ p@@ el pre@@ ached also to them that are dead , that they might be jud@@ ged according to men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live according to God in the spirit .
if ye be re@@ pro@@ ached for the name of Ch@@ r@@ ist , happy are ye ; for the spirit of gl@@ ory and of God res@@ te@@ th upon you : on their part he is ev@@ il spoken of , but on your part he is gl@@ ori@@ fied .
for when they speak great s@@ wel@@ ling words of van@@ ity , they al@@ l@@ ure through the lu@@ sts of the f@@ les@@ h , through much wan@@ ton@@ ness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in er@@ ror .
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ i@@ our J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led there@@ in , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
but the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved un@@ to fire against the day of judgment and per@@ di@@ tion of un@@ go@@ dly men .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Wor@@ d of life ;
I write un@@ to you , fa@@ thers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write un@@ to you , young men , because ye have overcome the w@@ ic@@ ked one . I write un@@ to you , little children , because ye have known the F@@ ather .
I have written un@@ to you , fa@@ thers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written un@@ to you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abi@@ de@@ th in you , and ye have overcome the w@@ ic@@ ked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the F@@ ather is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , and the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the F@@ ather , but is of the world .
they went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manif@@ est that they were not all of us .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
and every spirit that conf@@ ess@@ eth not that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is come in the f@@ les@@ h is not of God : and this is that spirit of anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , where@@ of ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
we are of God : he that know@@ eth God he@@ aret@@ h us ; he that is not of God he@@ aret@@ h not us . Her@@ e@@ by know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of er@@ ror .
if a man say , I love God , and ha@@ te@@ th his brother , he is a li@@ ar : for he that lov@@ eth not his brother whom he hat@@ h seen , how can he love God whom he hat@@ h not seen ?
these things have I written un@@ to you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eter@@ nal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
the my@@ ster@@ y of the seven stars which th@@ ou sa@@ west in my right hand , and the seven golden cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks . the seven stars are the an@@ gel@@ s of the seven churches : and the seven cand@@ le@@ sti@@ cks which th@@ ou sa@@ west are the seven churches .
I know TH@@ Y works , and TH@@ Y labour , and TH@@ Y patience , and how th@@ ou can@@ st not bear them which are ev@@ il : and th@@ ou h@@ ast tried them which say they are A@@ post@@ les , and are not , and h@@ ast found them li@@ ars :
remember therefore from wh@@ ence th@@ ou art fallen , and rep@@ ent , and do the first works ; or else I will come un@@ to the@@ e quickly , and will remove TH@@ Y cand@@ le@@ stick out of his place , except th@@ ou rep@@ ent .
he that hat@@ h an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t sa@@ ith un@@ to the churches ; To him that over@@ co@@ me@@ th will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the mid@@ st of the par@@ ad@@ ise of God .
I know TH@@ Y works , and tri@@ bu@@ lation , and poverty , ( but th@@ ou art rich ) and I know the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan .
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write ; These things sa@@ ith the Son of God , who hat@@ h his eyes like un@@ to a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like fine br@@ ass ;
and un@@ to the an@@ gel of the church in Sar@@ dis write ; These things sa@@ ith he that hat@@ h the seven spir@@ its of God , and the seven stars ; I know TH@@ Y works , that th@@ ou h@@ ast a name that th@@ ou li@@ v@@ est , and art dead .
he that over@@ co@@ me@@ th , the same shall be clo@@ th@@ ed in white ra@@ im@@ ent ; and I will not blo@@ t out his name out of the book of life , but I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
and to the an@@ gel of the church in Phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a write ; These things sa@@ ith he that is hol@@ y , he that is true , he that hat@@ h the key of David , he that open@@ eth , and no man shut@@ te@@ th ; and shut@@ te@@ th , and no man open@@ eth ;
be@@ hold , I will make them of the syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; be@@ hold , I will make them to come and worship before TH@@ Y feet , and to know that I have lov@@ ed the@@ e .
because th@@ ou h@@ ast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep the@@ e from the hour of temp@@ tation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that d@@ well upon the ear@@ th .
and I be@@ held , and , lo , in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one and of the four be@@ asts , and in the mid@@ st of the el@@ ders , stood a lam@@ b as it had been sla@@ in , having seven hor@@ ns and seven eyes , which are the seven spir@@ its of God sent forth into all the ear@@ th .
and I be@@ held , and I heard the voice of many an@@ gel@@ s round about the th@@ r@@ one and the be@@ asts and the el@@ ders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
and when he had opened the third se@@ al , I heard the third be@@ ast say , C@@ ome and see . and I be@@ held , and lo a black hor@@ se ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balan@@ ces in his hand .
and when he had opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of them that were sla@@ in for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and the kings of the ear@@ th , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief cap@@ tains , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men , and every bon@@ d@@ man , and every free man , hi@@ d themselves in the den@@ s and in the ro@@ cks of the mountains ;
and after these things I saw four an@@ gel@@ s standing on the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , holding the four winds of the ear@@ th , that the wind should not blow on the ear@@ th , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
and I saw another an@@ gel as@@ cen@@ ding from the east , having the se@@ al of the living God : and he cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice to the four an@@ gel@@ s , to whom it was given to hurt the ear@@ th and the sea ,
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and for@@ ty and four thousand of all the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
and the smoke of the incen@@ se , which came with the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints , as@@ cen@@ ded up before God out of the an@@ gel 's hand .
and the third part of the cre@@ atures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the third an@@ gel so@@ unded , and there fell a great star from heav@@ en , burning as it were a lam@@ p , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fo@@ un@@ tains of waters ;
and he opened the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it ; and there ar@@ ose a smoke out of the p@@ it , as the smoke of a great fur@@ n@@ ace ; and the sun and the air were dar@@ ken@@ ed by reason of the smoke of the p@@ it .
and it was comman@@ ded them that they should not hurt the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the se@@ al of God in their fore@@ heads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tor@@ mented five months : and their tor@@ ment was as the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ p@@ ion , when he stri@@ ket@@ h a man .
and the shap@@ es of the loc@@ ust@@ s were like un@@ to hor@@ ses prepared un@@ to battle ; and on their heads were as it were crow@@ ns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had a king over them , which is the an@@ gel of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it , whose name in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ton@@ gue is Ab@@ add@@ on , but in the Greek ton@@ gue hat@@ h his name A@@ poll@@ yon .
and thus I saw the hor@@ ses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having bre@@ ast@@ plates of fire , and of j@@ ac@@ inth , and bri@@ m@@ stone : and the heads of the hor@@ ses were as the heads of li@@ ons ; and out of their m@@ ou@@ ths issued fire and smoke and bri@@ m@@ stone .
for their power is in their m@@ outh , and in their ta@@ ils : for their ta@@ ils were like un@@ to Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
and I saw another m@@ igh@@ ty an@@ gel come down from heav@@ en , clo@@ th@@ ed with a cl@@ oud : and a ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pil@@ lars of fire :
and the voice which I heard from heav@@ en sp@@ ake un@@ to me again , and said , G@@ o and take the little book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel which stan@@ de@@ th upon the sea and upon the ear@@ th .
and I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my m@@ outh swe@@ et as hon@@ ey : and as soon as I had e@@ aten it , my bel@@ ly was bitter .
but the court which is without the temp@@ le leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given un@@ to the Gen@@ ti@@ les : and the hol@@ y city shall they tre@@ ad under fo@@ ot for@@ ty and two months .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the be@@ ast that as@@ cen@@ de@@ th out of the bott@@ om@@ less p@@ it shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were sla@@ in of men seven thousand : and the re@@ mn@@ ant were aff@@ righ@@ ted , and gave gl@@ ory to the God of heav@@ en .
and the seventh an@@ gel so@@ unded ; and there were great voices in heav@@ en , saying , The k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of this world are become the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of our Lord , and of his Ch@@ r@@ ist ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and his ta@@ il drew the third part of the stars of heav@@ en , and did cast them to the ear@@ th : and the dra@@ g@@ on stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to dev@@ our her child as soon as it was born .
and the great dra@@ g@@ on was cast out , that old ser@@ p@@ ent , called the dev@@ il , and S@@ atan , which dec@@ e@@ i@@ vet@@ h the whole world : he was cast out into the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were cast out with him .
and to the woman were given two w@@ ings of a great e@@ ag@@ le , that she might fly into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , into her place , where she is no@@ ur@@ ished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the ser@@ p@@ ent .
and I stood upon the s@@ and of the sea , and saw a be@@ ast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten hor@@ ns , and upon his hor@@ ns ten crow@@ ns , and upon his heads the name of b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y .
and the be@@ ast which I saw was like un@@ to a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his m@@ outh as the m@@ outh of a lion : and the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
he that le@@ ade@@ th into cap@@ tivity shall go into cap@@ tivity : he that kil@@ le@@ th with the s@@ word must be killed with the s@@ word . here is the patience and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
and he had power to give life un@@ to the image of the be@@ ast , that the image of the be@@ ast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the be@@ ast should be killed .
and the smoke of their tor@@ ment as@@ cen@@ de@@ th up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and wh@@ os@@ o@@ ever recei@@ vet@@ h the mark of his name .
and another an@@ gel came out of the temp@@ le , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice to him that sat on the cl@@ oud , th@@ rust in TH@@ Y si@@ ck@@ le , and re@@ ap : for the time is come for the@@ e to re@@ ap ; for the har@@ v@@ est of the ear@@ th is ri@@ pe .
and I saw as it were a sea of glass min@@ g@@ led with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the be@@ ast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the har@@ ps of God .
and the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temp@@ le , ti@@ ll the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s were fulfilled .
and the first went , and p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the ear@@ th ; and there fell a no@@ is@@ ome and gri@@ ev@@ ous sor@@ e upon the men which had the mark of the be@@ ast , and upon them which wor@@ shi@@ pped his image .
and the sixth an@@ gel p@@ oured out his vi@@ al upon the great river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates ; and the water there@@ of was dri@@ ed up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three un@@ clean spir@@ its like fro@@ gs come out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t .
for they are the spir@@ its of dev@@ ils , working mir@@ ac@@ les , which go forth un@@ to the kings of the ear@@ th and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Bab@@ yl@@ on came in re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance before God , to give un@@ to her the c@@ up of the wine of the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he co@@ me@@ th , he must continue a short space .
for all nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her for@@ nic@@ ation , and the kings of the ear@@ th have committed for@@ nic@@ ation with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th are wa@@ xed rich through the ab@@ und@@ ance of her de@@ lic@@ acies .
and the kings of the ear@@ th , who have committed for@@ nic@@ ation and lived deli@@ ci@@ ously with her , shall be@@ wa@@ il her , and la@@ ment for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
and the light of a cand@@ le shall sh@@ ine no more at all in the@@ e ; and the voice of the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om and of the bri@@ de shall be heard no more at all in the@@ e : for TH@@ Y mer@@ chan@@ ts were the great men of the ear@@ th ; for by TH@@ Y sor@@ cer@@ ies were all nations dec@@ e@@ ived .
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments : for he hat@@ h jud@@ ged the great wh@@ ore , which did corrupt the ear@@ th with her for@@ nic@@ ation , and hat@@ h av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and shall go out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four quarters of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
and they went up on the b@@ read@@ th of the ear@@ th , and comp@@ ass@@ ed the camp of the sa@@ ints about , and the bel@@ ov@@ ed city : and fire came down from God out of heav@@ en , and dev@@ oured them .
and I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were jud@@ ged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
and he meas@@ ured the wall there@@ of , an hundred and for@@ ty and four cu@@ bi@@ ts , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the an@@ gel .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to sh@@ ine in it : for the gl@@ ory of God did ligh@@ ten it , and the lam@@ b is the light there@@ of .
and the nations of them which are sav@@ ed shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the ear@@ th do bring their gl@@ ory and honour into it .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel which she@@ wed me these things .
he that is un@@ just , let him be un@@ just still : and he which is fil@@ thy , let him be fil@@ thy still : and he that is righ@@ te@@ ous , let him be righ@@ te@@ ous still : and he that is hol@@ y , let him be hol@@ y still .
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the hol@@ y city , and from the things which are written in this book .
