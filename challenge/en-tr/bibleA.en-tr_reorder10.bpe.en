now the ear@@ th was form@@ less and empty . d@@ ark@@ ness was on the sur@@ face of the deep . God 's Spiri@@ t was h@@ over@@ ing over the sur@@ face of the waters .
God made the exp@@ ans@@ e , and divided the waters which were under the exp@@ ans@@ e from the waters which were above the exp@@ ans@@ e ; and it was so .
the ear@@ th yi@@ elded gr@@ ass , her@@ bs yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed after their kind , and trees bearing fruit , with its se@@ ed in it , after their kind ; and God saw that it was good .
God made the two great lights : the greater light to rule the day , and the les@@ ser light to rule the night . he also made the stars .
God made the animals of the ear@@ th after their kind , and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck after their kind , and everything that cre@@ ep@@ s on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
God said , " be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed , which is on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , which be@@ ars fruit yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed . it will be your food .
on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
this is the history of the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens .
but a mist went up from the ear@@ th , and wat@@ ered the whole sur@@ face of the ground .
a river went out of E@@ den to water the gar@@ den ; and from there it was par@@ ted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is P@@ ish@@ on : this is the one which flows through the whole land of Hav@@ il@@ ah , where there is gold ;
the name of the second river is G@@ ih@@ on : the same river that flows through the whole land of C@@ ush .
the name of the third river is H@@ idde@@ kel : this is the one which flows in front of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . the fourth river is the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will su@@ rely die . "
the man gave names to all li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and to the birds of the sky , and to every animal of the field ; but for man there was not found a hel@@ per su@@ itable for him .
Yah@@ we@@ h God caused a deep sle@@ ep to fall on the man , and he sle@@ pt ; and he took one of his ri@@ bs , and closed up the f@@ les@@ h in its place .
he made the ri@@ b , which Yah@@ we@@ h God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one f@@ les@@ h .
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the gar@@ den , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
they heard the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day , and the man and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the gar@@ den .
by the swe@@ at of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are d@@ ust , and to d@@ ust you shall return . "
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed Cher@@ ub@@ s at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den , and the fla@@ me of a s@@ word which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
again she gave birth , to C@@ ain 's brother A@@ bel . A@@ bel was a keep@@ er of she@@ ep , but C@@ ain was a til@@ ler of the ground .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don '@@ t do well , sin cro@@ u@@ ches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
now you are Cur@@ sed because of the ground , which has opened its m@@ outh to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you ti@@ ll the ground , it won '@@ t yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . "
to E@@ no@@ ch was born Ira@@ d . Ira@@ d became the father of Meh@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ el . Meh@@ u@@ j@@ a@@ el became the father of Meth@@ us@@ ha@@ el . Meth@@ us@@ ha@@ el became the father of La@@ me@@ ch .
this is the book of the generations of A@@ dam . in the day that God created man , he made him in God 's lik@@ eness .
A@@ dam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image , and named him S@@ eth .
it happened , when men began to multi@@ ply on the sur@@ face of the ground , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were born to them ,
that God 's sons saw that men 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wi@@ ves of all that they chose .
Yah@@ we@@ h saw that the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of man was great in the ear@@ th , and that every imag@@ ination of the th@@ ou@@ ghts of his heart was only ev@@ il continu@@ ally .
this is the history of the generations of No@@ ah . No@@ ah was a righ@@ te@@ ous man , bla@@ me@@ less among the people of his time . No@@ ah walked with God .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , its b@@ read@@ th fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its he@@ ight thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h having the bre@@ ath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the ear@@ th will die .
but I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wi@@ ves with you .
of every living thing of all f@@ les@@ h , you shall bring two of every sort into the ship , to keep them alive with you . they shall be male and female .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the ear@@ th for for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the sur@@ face of the ground . "
No@@ ah went into the ship with his sons , his wife , and his sons ' wi@@ ves , because of the waters of the flood .
the flood was for@@ ty days on the ear@@ th . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the ear@@ th .
God remember@@ ed No@@ ah , all the animals , and all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that were with him in the ship ; and God made a wind to pass over the ear@@ th . the waters subsi@@ ded .
the deep 's fo@@ un@@ tains and the sky 's windows were also stopped , and the rain from the sky was re@@ strained .
the ship rested in the seventh month , on the se@@ ven@@ teen@@ th day of the month , on Ar@@ ar@@ at 's mountains .
the waters rece@@ ded continu@@ ally until the tenth month . in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
it happened at the end of for@@ ty days , that No@@ ah opened the window of the ship which he had made ,
the do@@ ve came back to him at evening , and , be@@ hold , in her m@@ outh was an olive le@@ af p@@ lu@@ cked off . so No@@ ah knew that the waters were ab@@ ated from the ear@@ th .
No@@ ah built an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h , and took of every clean animal , and of every clean bird , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar .
I set my ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w in the cl@@ oud , and it will be for a sign of a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and the ear@@ th .
S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it on both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , went in back@@ wards , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father . their faces were back@@ wards , and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
Can@@ a@@ an became the father of S@@ id@@ on ( his fir@@ st@@ born ) , H@@ eth ,
the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from S@@ id@@ on , as you go toward Ger@@ ar , to Gaza ; as you go toward So@@ dom , G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , to L@@ as@@ ha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , in their nations .
to S@@ hem , the father of all the children of E@@ ber , the el@@ der brother of Jap@@ het@@ h , to him also were children born .
these are the sons of S@@ hem , after their families , after their languages , in their lands , after their nations .
it happened , as they trav@@ eled east , that they found a pla@@ in in the land of Sh@@ in@@ ar , and they lived there .
Yah@@ we@@ h said , " be@@ hold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be with@@ held from them , which they intend to do .
so Yah@@ we@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad from there on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Bab@@ el , because there Yah@@ we@@ h conf@@ used the language of all the ear@@ th . from there , Yah@@ we@@ h sc@@ at@@ tered them abroad on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th .
this is the history of the generations of S@@ hem . S@@ hem was one hundred years old and became the father of Ar@@ p@@ ach@@ s@@ had two years after the flood .
now this is the history of the generations of Ter@@ ah . Ter@@ ah became the father of Ab@@ ram , N@@ ah@@ or , and Har@@ an . Har@@ an became the father of lot .
Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took wi@@ ves . the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai , and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an who was also the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
now Yah@@ we@@ h said to Ab@@ ram , " G@@ et out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
I will b@@ less those who b@@ less you , and I will cur@@ se him who cur@@ ses you . all of the families of the ear@@ th will be b@@ les@@ sed in you . "
there was a fam@@ ine in the land . Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to live as a foreig@@ ner there , for the fam@@ ine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sar@@ ai his wife , " Se@@ e now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
it will happen , when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will see you , that they will say , ' This is his wife . ' they will kill me , but they will save you alive .
to the place of the alt@@ ar , which he had made there at the first . there Ab@@ ram called on the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the land was not able to bear them , that they might live together : for their sub@@ stance was great , so that they could not live together .
there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of lot 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite lived in the land at that time .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Ab@@ ram , after lot was separated from him , " Now , lift up your eyes , and look from the place where you are , nor@@ th@@ ward and sou@@ th@@ ward and eas@@ tw@@ ard and w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard ,
I will make your off@@ spring as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , so that if a man can number the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th , then your se@@ ed may also be num@@ ber@@ ed .
arise , walk through the land in its length and in its b@@ read@@ th ; for I will give it to you . "
it happened in the days of Am@@ ra@@ ph@@ el , king of Sh@@ in@@ ar , Ari@@ o@@ ch , king of El@@ las@@ ar , Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ o@@ mer , king of E@@ lam , and ti@@ dal , king of Go@@ i@@ im ,
that they made war with Ber@@ a , king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ s@@ ha , king of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Sh@@ ina@@ b , king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and She@@ me@@ ber , king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a ( the same is Zo@@ ar ) .
they returned , and came to En Mis@@ h@@ p@@ at ( the same is K@@ ade@@ sh ) , and struck all the country of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and also the Am@@ ori@@ tes , that lived in Haz@@ az@@ on Tam@@ ar .
now the val@@ ley of S@@ iddi@@ m was full of tar p@@ its ; and the kings of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h fled , and they fell there , and those who remained fled to the hil@@ ls .
when Ab@@ ram heard that his relative was taken cap@@ tive , he led out his trained men , born in his house , three hundred and E@@ igh@@ teen , and pursu@@ ed as far as Dan .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursu@@ ed them to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his relative , lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and b@@ les@@ sed be God Most High , who has delivered your enem@@ ies into your hand . " Ab@@ ram gave him a tenth of all .
Ab@@ ram said , " be@@ hold , to me you have given no se@@ ed : and , be@@ hold , one born in my house is my he@@ ir . "
be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying , " This man will not be your he@@ ir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your he@@ ir . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t divide the birds .
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , be@@ hold , a smoking fur@@ n@@ ace , and a f@@ laming tor@@ ch passed between these pieces .
Sar@@ ai , Ab@@ ram 's wife , took Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , her hand@@ ma@@ id , after Ab@@ ram had lived ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to Ab@@ ram her husband to be his wife .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h found her by a fo@@ un@@ tain of water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , by the fo@@ un@@ tain in the way to Sh@@ ur .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h said to her , " I will greatly multi@@ ply your se@@ ed , that they will not be num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude . "
neither will your name any more be called Ab@@ ram , but your name will be Ab@@ ra@@ ham ; for I have made you the father of a multi@@ tude of nations .
I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and you and your se@@ ed after you throughout their generations for an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , to be a God to you and to your se@@ ed after you .
this is my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which you shall keep , between me and you and your se@@ ed after you . every male among you shall be circum@@ c@@ ised .
you shall be circum@@ c@@ ised in the f@@ les@@ h of your fo@@ res@@ kin . it will be a to@@ ken of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant between me and you .
the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised male who is not circum@@ c@@ ised in the f@@ les@@ h of his fo@@ res@@ kin , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant . "
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of So@@ dom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
they struck the men who were at the door of the house with b@@ lin@@ d@@ ness , both small and great , so that they we@@ ar@@ ied themselves to find the door .
but he lin@@ gered ; and the men gra@@ bbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ' hands , Yah@@ we@@ h being mer@@ ci@@ ful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in which lot lived .
come , let 's make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve our father 's se@@ ed . "
they made their father drink wine that night : and the fir@@ st@@ born went in , and lay with her father . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know when she lay down , nor when she ar@@ ose .
they made their father drink wine that night also . the younger went and lay with him . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know when she lay down , nor when she got up .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their e@@ ar . the men were very scar@@ ed .
besides , she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
she said , " Wh@@ o would have said to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , that Sar@@ ah would nur@@ se children ? for I have bor@@ ne him a son in his old age . "
God was with the boy , and he grew . he lived in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and became , as he grew up , an ar@@ cher .
he lived in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
it happened at that time , that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and P@@ hic@@ ol the captain of his army spoke to Ab@@ ra@@ ham , saying , " God is with you in all that you do .
so they made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant at Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba . A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up with P@@ hic@@ ol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Ab@@ ra@@ ham built the alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar , on the wood .
and said , " I have sworn by myself , says Yah@@ we@@ h , because you have done this thing , and have not with@@ held your son , your only son ,
that I will b@@ less you greatly , and I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed greatly like the stars of the heav@@ ens , and like the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your se@@ ed will poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham rose up , and bo@@ wed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of H@@ eth .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight , hear me , and ent@@ re@@ at for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
now E@@ ph@@ ron was sitting in the middle of the children of H@@ eth . E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the hearing of the children of H@@ eth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Ab@@ ra@@ ham list@@ ened to E@@ ph@@ ron . Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , according to the current mer@@ chan@@ ts ' standard .
after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re ( that is , He@@ br@@ on ) , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the field , and the cave that is in it , were de@@ eded to Ab@@ ra@@ ham for a possession of a bur@@ ying place by the children of H@@ eth .
I will make you swe@@ ar by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en and the God of the ear@@ th , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I live .
the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls , of his master 's ca@@ me@@ ls , and depar@@ ted , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
he made the ca@@ me@@ ls k@@ ne@@ el down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
be@@ hold , I am standing by the spring of water . the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher on her sho@@ ul@@ der .
the young la@@ dy was very beautiful to look at , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
it happened , as the ca@@ me@@ ls had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a sh@@ ek@@ el weight , and two brac@@ ele@@ ts for her hands of ten sh@@ ek@@ els weight of gold ,
he said to me , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , before whom I walk , will send his an@@ gel with you , and prosp@@ er your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don '@@ t give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
and she will tell me , " Dr@@ ink , and I will also draw for your ca@@ me@@ ls , " -@@ -@@ let her be the woman whom Yah@@ we@@ h has appointed for my master 's son . '
she hur@@ ried and let down her pit@@ cher from her sho@@ ul@@ der , and said , ' Dr@@ ink , and I will also give your ca@@ me@@ ls a drink . ' so I d@@ rank , and she also gave the ca@@ me@@ ls a drink .
be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken . "
the ser@@ vant brought out je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah . he also gave pre@@ ci@@ ous things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and d@@ rank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " S@@ end me away to my master . "
they b@@ les@@ sed Re@@ bek@@ ah , and said to her , " Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands , and let your se@@ ed poss@@ ess the gate of those who h@@ ate them . "
I@@ sa@@ ac went out to medi@@ t@@ ate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , be@@ hold , there were ca@@ me@@ ls coming .
but to the sons of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave gifts . he sent them away from I@@ sa@@ ac his son , while he yet lived , eas@@ tw@@ ard , to the east country .
Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , his sons , buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ,
now this is the history of the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ ore to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , then K@@ ed@@ ar , Ad@@ be@@ el , Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
these are the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their en@@ camp@@ ments : twelve pr@@ inces , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el : one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m , the sister of Lab@@ an the Syrian , to be his wife .
there was a fam@@ ine in the land , besides the first fam@@ ine that was in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham . I@@ sa@@ ac went to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to Ger@@ ar .
I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed as the stars of the sky , and will give to your se@@ ed all these lands . in your se@@ ed will all the nations of the ear@@ th be b@@ les@@ sed ,
now all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had du@@ g in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped , and filled with ear@@ th .
it happened the same day , that I@@ sa@@ ac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had du@@ g , and said to him , " We have found water . "
when E@@ sa@@ u was for@@ ty years old , he took as wife Judi@@ th , the daughter of Be@@ eri the H@@ itti@@ te , and Bas@@ em@@ ath , the daughter of El@@ on the H@@ itti@@ te .
now therefore , ple@@ ase take your weapons , your qu@@ i@@ ver and your bo@@ w , and go out to the field , and take me ven@@ ison .
make me sav@@ ory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my sou@@ l may b@@ less you before I die . "
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young go@@ ats . I will make them sav@@ ory food for your father , such as he lov@@ es .
he went , and got them , and brought them to his mother . his mother made sav@@ ory food , such as his father lov@@ ed .
Re@@ bek@@ ah took the good clo@@ th@@ es of E@@ sa@@ u , her el@@ der son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jac@@ o@@ b , her younger son .
she gave the sav@@ ory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jac@@ o@@ b .
Jac@@ o@@ b went near to I@@ sa@@ ac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jac@@ o@@ b 's voice , but the hands are the hands of E@@ sa@@ u . "
let peoples serve you , and nations bo@@ w down to you . be lor@@ d over your brothers . let your mother 's sons bo@@ w down to you . Cur@@ sed be everyone who cur@@ ses you . b@@ les@@ sed be everyone who b@@ les@@ ses you . "
it happened , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b had just gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
when E@@ sa@@ u heard the words of his father , he cri@@ ed with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " b@@ less me , even me also , my father . "
I@@ sa@@ ac his father answ@@ ered him , " be@@ hold , of the fat@@ ness of the ear@@ th will be your d@@ wel@@ ling , and of the dew of the sky from above .
by your s@@ word will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k . "
E@@ sa@@ u went to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took , besides the wi@@ ves that he had , Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , the sister of N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , to be his wife .
he dre@@ amed . be@@ hold , a st@@ air@@ way set upon the ear@@ th , and its top reached to heav@@ en . be@@ hold , the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on it .
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil on its top .
he called the name of that place Be@@ the@@ l , but the name of the city was L@@ uz at the first .
Jac@@ o@@ b vowed a vo@@ w , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clo@@ thing to put on ,
then this stone , which I have set up for a pil@@ lar , will be God 's house . of all that you will give me I will su@@ rely give the tenth to you . "
Jac@@ o@@ b said to Lab@@ an , " Gi@@ ve me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
when Le@@ ah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Zil@@ p@@ ah , her hand@@ ma@@ id , and gave her to Jac@@ o@@ b as a wife .
she conce@@ ived , b@@ ore a son , and said , " God has taken away my re@@ pro@@ ach . "
it happened , when R@@ ach@@ el had bor@@ ne Joseph , that Jac@@ o@@ b said to Lab@@ an , " S@@ end me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
give me my wi@@ ves and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
he set the ro@@ ds which he had pe@@ eled opposite the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ t@@ rough@@ s where the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink . they conce@@ ived when they came to drink .
Jac@@ o@@ b separated the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the stre@@ aked and all the black in the flock of Lab@@ an : and he put his own dro@@ ves apart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them into Lab@@ an 's flock .
it happened , wh@@ en@@ ever the stronger of the flock conce@@ ived , that Jac@@ o@@ b laid the ro@@ ds before the eyes of the flock in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conce@@ ive among the ro@@ ds ;
but when the flock were fe@@ e@@ ble , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them in . so the fe@@ eb@@ ler were Lab@@ an 's , and the stronger Jac@@ o@@ b 's .
Jac@@ o@@ b saw the expression on Lab@@ an 's face , and , be@@ hold , it was not toward him as before .
and said to them , " I see the expression on your father 's face , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father has been with me .
if he said this , ' The spec@@ k@@ led will be your wages , ' then all the flock b@@ ore spec@@ k@@ led . if he said this , ' The stre@@ aked will be your wages , ' then all the flock b@@ ore stre@@ aked .
it happened during m@@ ating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and be@@ hold , the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap@@ ed on the flock were stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and be@@ hold , all the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap on the flock are stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led , for I have seen all that Lab@@ an does to you .
for all the ri@@ ches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
Jac@@ o@@ b dec@@ e@@ ived Lab@@ an the Syrian , in that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell him that he was running away .
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly lon@@ ged for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my go@@ ds ? "
Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them . he went out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
now R@@ ach@@ el had taken the ter@@ ap@@ him , put them in the C@@ ame@@ l 's s@@ add@@ le , and sat on them . Lab@@ an felt about all the tent , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your e@@ w@@ es and your female go@@ ats have not cast their young , and I ha@@ ven '@@ t e@@ aten the r@@ ams of your f@@ loc@@ ks .
now come , let us make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
if you aff@@ lic@@ t my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , or if you take wi@@ ves besides my da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , no man is with us ; be@@ hold , God is witness between me and you . "
May this he@@ ap be a witness , and the pil@@ lar be a witness , that I will not pass over this he@@ ap to you , and that you will not pass over this he@@ ap and this pil@@ lar to me , for harm .
the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of N@@ ah@@ or , the God of their father , judge between us . " then Jac@@ o@@ b s@@ wor@@ e by the fear of his father , I@@ sa@@ ac .
Jac@@ o@@ b offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Lab@@ an rose up , and k@@ is@@ sed his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and b@@ les@@ sed them . Lab@@ an depar@@ ted and returned to his place .
Jac@@ o@@ b sent mes@@ sen@@ gers in front of him to E@@ sa@@ u , his brother , to the land of Se@@ ir , the field of E@@ dom .
then Jac@@ o@@ b was greatly afraid and was dist@@ ressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the f@@ loc@@ ks , and the her@@ ds , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , into two companies ;
you said , ' I will su@@ rely do you good , and make your se@@ ed as the s@@ and of the sea , which can '@@ t be num@@ ber@@ ed because there are so many . ' "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every her@@ d by itself , and said to his servants , " Pas@@ s over before me , and put a space between her@@ d and her@@ d . "
he comman@@ ded the fore@@ most , saying , " When E@@ sa@@ u , my brother , meets you , and asks you , saying , ' whose are you ? where are you going ? whose are these before you ? '
then you shall say , ' They are your ser@@ vant , Jac@@ o@@ b 's . it is a present sent to my lor@@ d , E@@ sa@@ u . be@@ hold , he also is behind us . ' "
he comman@@ ded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the her@@ ds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to E@@ sa@@ u , when you find him .
when he saw that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t prev@@ ail against him , he touched the hol@@ low of his th@@ igh , and the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh was strained , as he wrest@@ led .
Jac@@ o@@ b called the name of the place Pen@@ i@@ el : for , he said , " I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . "
therefore the children of Israel don '@@ t eat the sin@@ ew of the hip , which is on the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , to this day , because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew of the hip .
Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Le@@ ah , R@@ ach@@ el , and the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
he himself passed over in front of them , and bo@@ wed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , " Wh@@ o are these with you ? " he said , " The children whom God has gr@@ ac@@ iously given your ser@@ vant . "
Le@@ ah also and her children came near , and bo@@ wed themselves . after them , Joseph came near with R@@ ach@@ el , and they bo@@ wed themselves .
Jac@@ o@@ b came in peace to the city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m ; and en@@ camp@@ ed before the city .
he bought the par@@ cel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
Din@@ ah , the daughter of Le@@ ah , whom she b@@ ore to Jac@@ o@@ b , went out to see the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the land .
now Jac@@ o@@ b heard that he had def@@ iled Din@@ ah , his daughter ; and his sons were with his li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck in the field . Jac@@ o@@ b held his peace until they came .
only on this condition will we consent to you . if you will be as we are , that every male of you be circum@@ c@@ ised ;
but if you will not listen to us , to be circum@@ c@@ ised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man di@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait to do this thing , because he had de@@ light in Jac@@ o@@ b 's daughter , and he was hon@@ ored above all the house of his father .
Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , came to the gate of their city , and talked with the men of their city , saying ,
only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us , to become one people , if every male among us is circum@@ c@@ ised , as they are circum@@ c@@ ised .
they killed Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went away .
they took their f@@ loc@@ ks , their her@@ ds , their don@@ ke@@ ys , that which was in the city , that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth . they took cap@@ tive all their little ones and their wi@@ ves , and took as pl@@ under everything that was in the house .
God said to Jac@@ o@@ b , " arise , go up to Be@@ the@@ l , and live there . make there an alt@@ ar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of E@@ sa@@ u your brother . "
then Jac@@ o@@ b said to his household , and to all who were with him , " P@@ ut away the foreign go@@ ds that are among you , pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves , change your gar@@ ments .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an alt@@ ar to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they gave to Jac@@ o@@ b all the foreign go@@ ds which were in their hands , and the r@@ ings which were in their e@@ ars ; and Jac@@ o@@ b hi@@ d them under the o@@ ak which was by Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz ( that is , Be@@ the@@ l ) , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , he and all the people who were with him .
he built an alt@@ ar there , and called the place El Beth El ; because there God was revealed to him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
the land which I gave to Ab@@ ra@@ ham and I@@ sa@@ ac , I will give it to you , and to your se@@ ed after you will I give the land . "
Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he spoke with him , a pil@@ lar of stone . he p@@ oured out a drink offering on it , and p@@ oured oil on it .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Re@@ ub@@ en went and lay with Bil@@ ha@@ h , his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b were twelve .
the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah ( Le@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id ) : G@@ ad and As@@ her . these are the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , who were born to him in Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m .
I@@ sa@@ ac gave up the spirit , and died , and was gathered to his people , old and full of days . E@@ sa@@ u and Jac@@ o@@ b , his sons , buried him .
now this is the history of the generations of E@@ sa@@ u ( that is , E@@ dom ) .
E@@ sa@@ u took his wi@@ ves from the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Can@@ a@@ an : A@@ da@@ h the daughter of El@@ on , the H@@ itti@@ te ; and O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , the H@@ iv@@ ite ;
O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah b@@ ore Je@@ ush , J@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah . these are the sons of E@@ sa@@ u , who were born to him in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
for their sub@@ stance was too great for them to d@@ well together , and the land of their travels co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t bear them because of their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
this is the history of the generations of E@@ sa@@ u the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites in the hill country of Se@@ ir :
these are the names of E@@ sa@@ u 's sons : Eli@@ p@@ haz , the son of A@@ da@@ h , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u ; and Re@@ uel , the son of Bas@@ em@@ ath , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u .
these were the sons of O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah , the daughter of An@@ ah , the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife : she b@@ ore to E@@ sa@@ u Je@@ ush , J@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of E@@ sa@@ u : the sons of Eli@@ p@@ haz the fir@@ st@@ born of E@@ sa@@ u : chief Tem@@ an , chief O@@ mar , chief Z@@ ep@@ ho , chief Ken@@ az ,
these are the sons of O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife : chief Je@@ ush , chief J@@ al@@ am , chief Kor@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of O@@ hol@@ ib@@ am@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , E@@ sa@@ u 's wife .
Dis@@ h@@ on , E@@ zer , and Dis@@ han . these are the chiefs who came of the H@@ ori@@ tes , the children of Se@@ ir in the land of E@@ dom .
chief Dis@@ h@@ on , chief E@@ zer , and chief Dis@@ han : these are the chiefs who came of the H@@ ori@@ tes , according to their chiefs in the land of Se@@ ir .
Hus@@ ham died , and Had@@ ad , the son of B@@ ed@@ ad , who struck Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ a@@ b , re@@ ig@@ ned in his place . the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Tim@@ na , chief Al@@ v@@ ah , chief J@@ eth@@ eth ,
chief Mag@@ di@@ el , and chief Ira@@ m . these are the chiefs of E@@ dom , according to their habi@@ tations in the land of their possession . this is E@@ sa@@ u , the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites .
for be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and be@@ hold , my she@@ af ar@@ ose and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es came around , and bo@@ wed down to my she@@ af . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have domin@@ ion over us ? " they ha@@ ted him all the more for his dre@@ ams and for his words .
a certain man found him , and be@@ hold , he was w@@ and@@ ering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the p@@ its , and we will say , ' A@@ n ev@@ il animal has dev@@ oured him . ' we will see what will become of his dre@@ ams . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stri@@ pped Joseph of his co@@ at , the co@@ at of many col@@ ors that was on him ;
Re@@ ub@@ en returned to the p@@ it ; and saw that Joseph was@@ n '@@ t in the p@@ it ; and he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es .
they took the co@@ at of many col@@ ors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's co@@ at or not . "
it happened at that time , that Ju@@ da@@ h went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , whose name was H@@ ira@@ h .
Ju@@ da@@ h said to O@@ nan , " G@@ o in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up se@@ ed to your brother . "
she ar@@ ose , and went away , and put off her ve@@ il from her , and put on the gar@@ ments of her wi@@ do@@ who@@ od .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes that had brought him down there .
he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t concern himself with anything , except for the food which he ate . Joseph was well @@@ -@@ @ built and hand@@ some .
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The H@@ eb@@ re@@ w ser@@ vant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mo@@ ck me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your ser@@ vant did to me , " that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
but Yah@@ we@@ h was with Joseph , and showed kin@@ d@@ ness to him , and gave him fav@@ or in the sight of the keep@@ er of the prison .
the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
it happened after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Bak@@ er off@@ ended their lor@@ d , the king of Egypt .
he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph , and he took care of them . they stayed in prison many days .
they both dre@@ amed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
Joseph came in to them in the morning , and saw them , and saw that they were sad .
the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , be@@ hold , a v@@ ine was in front of me ,
and in the v@@ ine were three branches . it was as though it bud@@ ded , it b@@ los@@ so@@ med , and its clu@@ sters produced ri@@ pe grap@@ es .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand ; and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand . "
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , the way you did when you were his c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . "
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head from off you , and will han@@ g you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your f@@ les@@ h from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the head of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
be@@ hold , there came up out of the river seven c@@ attle , sle@@ ek and f@@ at , and they f@@ ed in the mar@@ sh gr@@ ass .
be@@ hold , seven other c@@ attle came up after them out of the river , ug@@ ly and th@@ in , and stood by the other c@@ attle on the br@@ ink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ ic@@ ians and wise men . P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dre@@ ams , but there was no one who could interpre@@ t them to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
we dre@@ amed a dream in one night , I and he . we dre@@ amed each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream .
there was with us there a young man , a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent and called Joseph , and they brought him has@@ ti@@ ly out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . he sha@@ ved himself , changed his clo@@ thing , and came in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and be@@ hold , seven other c@@ attle came up after them , poor and very ug@@ ly and th@@ in , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ug@@ lin@@ ess .
and be@@ hold , seven heads of gra@@ in , with@@ ered , th@@ in , and b@@ lasted with the east wind , sp@@ run@@ g up after them .
the seven th@@ in and ug@@ ly c@@ attle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of gra@@ in b@@ lasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of fam@@ ine .
that is the thing which I spoke to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h . what God is about to do he has shown to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that fam@@ ine which follows ; for it will be very gri@@ ev@@ ous .
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint over@@ se@@ ers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up gra@@ in under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not per@@ ish through the fam@@ ine . "
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the th@@ r@@ one I will be greater than you . "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h said to Joseph , " be@@ hold , I have set you over all the land of Egypt . "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his sig@@ net ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in rob@@ es of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of fam@@ ine came , whom A@@ sen@@ ath , the daughter of Po@@ ti@@ ph@@ era pri@@ est of On , b@@ ore to him .
Joseph called the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my to@@ il , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of fam@@ ine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was fam@@ ine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the fam@@ ine was over all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans . the fam@@ ine was severe in the land of Egypt .
but Jac@@ o@@ b di@@ d@@ n '@@ t send Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , with his brothers ; for he said , " L@@ est perhaps harm happen to him . "
by this you shall be tested . by the life of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , you shall not go out from here , unless your youngest brother comes here .
Re@@ ub@@ en answ@@ ered them , saying , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I tell you , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t sin against the child , ' and you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ? therefore also , be@@ hold , his blood is required . "
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with gra@@ in , and to restore each man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his s@@ ack to give his don@@ key food in the lo@@ d@@ ging place , he saw his money . be@@ hold , it was in the m@@ outh of his s@@ ack .
they came to Jac@@ o@@ b their father , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and told him all that had happened to them , saying ,
it happened as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that be@@ hold , each man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack . when they and their father saw their bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
it happened , when they had e@@ aten up the gra@@ in which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " G@@ o again , buy us a little more food . "
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and got up , went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they was@@ hed their feet . he gave their don@@ ke@@ ys fo@@ d@@ der .
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans don '@@ t eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
they sat before him , the fir@@ st@@ born according to his birth@@ right , and the youngest according to his youth , and the men mar@@ v@@ eled one with another .
put my c@@ up , the silver c@@ up , in the s@@ ack 's m@@ outh of the youngest , with his gra@@ in money . " he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we ste@@ al silver or gold out of your lor@@ d 's house ?
we said to my lor@@ d , ' The boy can '@@ t leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can '@@ t go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " su@@ rely he is torn in pieces " ; and I ha@@ ven '@@ t seen him since .
for your ser@@ vant became col@@ lateral for the boy to my father , saying , ' If I don '@@ t bring him to you , then I will bear the blame to my father fore@@ ver . '
now therefore , ple@@ ase let your ser@@ vant stay instead of the boy , a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant to my lor@@ d ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
for how will I go up to my father , if the boy is@@ n '@@ t with me ? -@@ -@@ lest I see the ev@@ il that will come on my father . "
then Joseph co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cri@@ ed , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a re@@ mn@@ ant in the ear@@ th , and to save you alive by a great deliver@@ ance .
hur@@ ry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lor@@ d of all Egypt . come down to me . D@@ on '@@ t wait .
you shall tell my father of all my gl@@ ory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hur@@ ry and bring my father down here . "
the report of it was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the f@@ at of the land . '
he sent the following to his father : ten don@@ ke@@ ys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female don@@ ke@@ ys loaded with gra@@ in and bread and provision for his father by the way .
so he sent his brothers away , and they depar@@ ted . he said to them , " Se@@ e that you don '@@ t quar@@ rel on the way . "
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and the sons of Israel carried Jac@@ o@@ b , their father , their little ones , and their wi@@ ves , in the w@@ ag@@ ons which P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had sent to carry him .
they took their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and came into Egyp@@ t@@ -@@ -@@ Jac@@ o@@ b , and all his se@@ ed with him ,
these are the names of the children of Israel , who came into Egypt , Jac@@ o@@ b and his sons : Re@@ ub@@ en , Jac@@ o@@ b 's fir@@ st@@ born .
these are the sons of Zil@@ p@@ ah , whom Lab@@ an gave to Le@@ ah , his daughter , and these she b@@ ore to Jac@@ o@@ b , even six@@ teen so@@ ul@@ s .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , whom A@@ sen@@ ath , the daughter of Po@@ ti@@ ph@@ era , pri@@ est of On , b@@ ore to him .
these are the sons of Bil@@ ha@@ h , whom Lab@@ an gave to R@@ ach@@ el , his daughter , and these she b@@ ore to Jac@@ o@@ b : all the so@@ ul@@ s were seven .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s . all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , who came into Egypt , were sev@@ enty .
he sent Ju@@ da@@ h before him to Joseph , to show the way before him to Gos@@ h@@ en , and they came into the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
these men are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , for they have been ke@@ epers of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and they have brought their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , and all that they have . '
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the gra@@ in which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h should have the fifth . only the land of the pri@@ ests alone di@@ d@@ n '@@ t become P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en ; and they got themselves pos@@ sessions there@@ in , and were fruit@@ ful , and multi@@ p@@ lied exce@@ ed@@ ingly .
Jac@@ o@@ b lived in the land of Egypt se@@ ven@@ teen years . so the days of Jac@@ o@@ b , the years of his life , were one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
but when I sle@@ ep with my fa@@ thers , you shall carry me out of Egypt , and bur@@ y me in their bur@@ ying place . " he said , " I will do as you have said . "
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yo@@ urs . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inher@@ it@@ ance .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see . he brought them near to him ; and he k@@ is@@ sed them , and embrac@@ ed them .
Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stret@@ ched out his right hand , and laid it on E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , gui@@ ding his hands know@@ ingly , for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the Am@@ or@@ ite with my s@@ word and with my bo@@ w . "
bo@@ iling over as water , you shall not exc@@ el ; because you went up to your father 's bed , then def@@ iled it . he went up to my cou@@ ch .
my sou@@ l , don '@@ t come into their council . my gl@@ ory , don '@@ t be united to their assembly ; for in their an@@ ger they killed men . in their self @@@ -@@ @ will they ham@@ str@@ ung c@@ attle .
Cur@@ sed be their an@@ ger , for it was fierce ; and their wr@@ ath , for it was cru@@ el . I will divide them in Jac@@ o@@ b , and sc@@ at@@ ter them in Israel .
" Ju@@ da@@ h , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the nec@@ k of your enem@@ ies . your father 's sons will bo@@ w down before you .
the scep@@ ter will not de@@ part from Ju@@ da@@ h , nor the ru@@ ler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obe@@ di@@ ence of the peoples be .
binding his fo@@ al to the v@@ ine , his don@@ key 's col@@ t to the choice v@@ ine ; he has was@@ hed his gar@@ ments in wine , his rob@@ es in the blood of grap@@ es .
" Ze@@ bul@@ un will d@@ well at the ha@@ ven of the sea . he will be for a ha@@ ven of ships . his border will be on S@@ id@@ on .
but his bo@@ w remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b , ( from there is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel ) ,
all these are the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them and b@@ les@@ sed them . he b@@ les@@ sed everyone according to his b@@ les@@ sing .
when Jac@@ o@@ b made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yi@@ elded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
Joseph went up to bur@@ y his father ; and with him went up all the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , the el@@ ders of his house , all the el@@ ders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their f@@ loc@@ ks , and their her@@ ds , they left in the land of Gos@@ h@@ en .
they came to the th@@ res@@ hing floor of A@@ ta@@ d , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lamen@@ ted with a very great and severe lament@@ ation . he mour@@ ned for his father seven days .
as for you , you meant ev@@ il against me , but God meant it for good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save many people alive .
Joseph saw E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's children to the third generation . the children also of Mac@@ hir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , were born on Joseph 's k@@ ne@@ es .
so Joseph died , being one hundred ten years old , and they em@@ bal@@ med him , and he was put in a co@@ ff@@ in in Egypt .
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jac@@ o@@ b ) :
the children of Israel were fruit@@ ful , and increased ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and multi@@ p@@ lied , and grew exce@@ ed@@ ingly m@@ igh@@ ty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they aff@@ lic@@ ted them , the more they multi@@ p@@ lied and the more they spread out . they were gri@@ ev@@ ed because of the children of Israel .
the king of Egypt spoke to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of whom the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah ,
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ y@@ ru@@ s bas@@ ket for him , and co@@ ated it with tar and with pit@@ ch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to kill Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lived in the land of Mi@@ dian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed because of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up to God because of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . " Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
now , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the op@@ pression with which the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
come now therefore , and I will send you to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that you may bring my people , the children of Israel , out of Egypt . "
Mos@@ es said to God , " Wh@@ o am I , that I should go to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt ? "
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my won@@ ders which I will do in its mid@@ st , and after that he will let you go .
I will give this people fav@@ or in the sight of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and it will happen that when you go , you shall not go empty @@@ -@@ @ handed .
he said , " P@@ ut your hand inside your clo@@ ak again . " he put his hand inside his clo@@ ak again , and when he took it out of his clo@@ ak , be@@ hold , it had turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
" it will happen , if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
he said , " O@@ h , Lord , ple@@ ase send someone else . "
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a m@@ outh , and you will be to him as God .
Mos@@ es took his wife and his sons , and set them on a don@@ key , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Mos@@ es took God 's ro@@ d in his hand .
the people believed , and when they heard that Yah@@ we@@ h had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their aff@@ li@@ ction , then they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
after@@ ward Mos@@ es and Aaron came , and said to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , " This is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . ' "
let he@@ avier work be laid on the men , that they may la@@ bor there@@ in ; and don '@@ t let them pay any attention to lying words . "
the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h says : ' I will not give you stra@@ w .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Wh@@ y ha@@ ven '@@ t you fulfilled your qu@@ ota both yes@@ ter@@ day and today , in making bri@@ ck as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cri@@ ed to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , saying , " Wh@@ y do you deal this way with your servants ?
the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble , when it was said , " You shall not dimin@@ ish anything from your daily qu@@ ota of bri@@ cks ! "
I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their travels , in which they lived as ali@@ ens .
moreover I have heard the gro@@ an@@ ing of the children of Israel , whom the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans keep in bon@@ da@@ ge , and I have remember@@ ed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the heads of their fa@@ thers ' houses . the sons of Re@@ ub@@ en the fir@@ st@@ born of Israel : Han@@ o@@ ch , and Pal@@ lu , H@@ ez@@ ron , and Car@@ mi ; these are the families of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the sons of Simeon : J@@ em@@ uel , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite woman ; these are the families of Simeon .
these are the names of the sons of L@@ evi according to their generations : Ger@@ sh@@ on , and Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari ; and the years of the life of L@@ evi were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h : Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el ; and the years of the life of Ko@@ hat@@ h were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she b@@ ore him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el as his wife ; and she b@@ ore him Ph@@ ine@@ has . these are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Mos@@ es , to whom Yah@@ we@@ h said , " Br@@ ing out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
it happened on the day when Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es in the land of Egypt ,
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judg@@ ments .
the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
then P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h also called for the wise men and the sor@@ cer@@ ers . they also , the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt , did the same thing with their en@@ chan@@ tments .
the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become f@@ oul ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans shall lo@@ a@@ the to drink water from the river . " ' "
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became f@@ oul , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the mag@@ ic@@ ians of Egypt did the same thing with their en@@ chan@@ tments ; and P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's heart was har@@ dened , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to them ; as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h turned and went into his house , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t even take this to heart .
and the fro@@ gs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " T@@ ell Aaron , ' St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand with your ro@@ d over the rivers , over the stre@@ ams , and over the po@@ ols , and cause fro@@ gs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
the fro@@ gs shall de@@ part from you , and from your houses , and from your servants , and from your people . they shall remain in the river only . "
Yah@@ we@@ h did according to the word of Mos@@ es , and the fro@@ gs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
but when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h saw that there was a res@@ p@@ ite , he har@@ dened his heart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to them , as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
Yah@@ we@@ h did according to the word of Mos@@ es , and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of f@@ lies from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
be@@ hold , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h is on your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which are in the field , on the hor@@ ses , on the don@@ ke@@ ys , on the ca@@ me@@ ls , on the her@@ ds , and on the f@@ loc@@ ks with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make a distinc@@ tion between the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Israel and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h did that thing on the next day ; and all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Egypt died , but of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of the children of Israel , not one died .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not so much as one of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . but the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was st@@ ub@@ born , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t let the people go .
it shall become small d@@ ust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a bo@@ il breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the fur@@ n@@ ace , and stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h ; and Mos@@ es sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it up toward the sky ; and it became a bo@@ il breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal .
for this time I will send all my plagu@@ es against your heart , against your officials , and against your people ; that you may know that there is none like me in all the ear@@ th .
for now I would have stret@@ ched out my hand , and struck you and your people with p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and you would have been cut off from the ear@@ th ;
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand : to show you my power , and that my name may be declared throughout all the ear@@ th ;
those who fear@@ ed the word of Yah@@ we@@ h among the servants of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h made their servants and their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck flee into the houses .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his ro@@ d toward the heav@@ ens , and Yah@@ we@@ h sent Th@@ under , ha@@ il , and ligh@@ t@@ ning f@@ las@@ hed down to the ear@@ th . Yah@@ we@@ h ra@@ ined ha@@ il on the land of Egypt .
so there was very severe ha@@ il , and ligh@@ t@@ ning mixed with the ha@@ il , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the ha@@ il struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the ha@@ il struck every her@@ b of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Mos@@ es went out of the city from P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and spread abroad his hands to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and the th@@ unders and ha@@ il ce@@ ased , and the rain was not p@@ oured on the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " G@@ o in to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , for I have har@@ dened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their mid@@ st ,
or else , if you refuse to let my people go , be@@ hold , tomorrow I will bring loc@@ ust@@ s into your country ,
Mos@@ es said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , with our f@@ loc@@ ks and with our her@@ ds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Yah@@ we@@ h . "
the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very gri@@ ev@@ ous . before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
Yah@@ we@@ h turned an exceeding strong west wind , which took up the loc@@ ust@@ s , and dro@@ ve them into the Red Sea . there remained not one loc@@ ust in all the borders of Egypt .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see one another , neither did anyone rise from his place for three days ; but all the children of Israel had light in their d@@ wel@@ lings .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " Y@@ et one pla@@ gue more will I bring on P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and on Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go . when he lets you go , he will su@@ rely th@@ rust you out altogether .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who s@@ its on his th@@ r@@ one , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female ser@@ vant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
your lam@@ b shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h , a male a year old . you shall take it from the she@@ ep , or from the go@@ ats :
and you shall keep it until the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two do@@ or@@ posts and on the lin@@ tel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
they shall eat the f@@ les@@ h in that night , ro@@ asted with fire , and un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread . they shall eat it with bitter her@@ bs .
D@@ on '@@ t eat it raw , nor bo@@ iled at all with water , but ro@@ asted with fire ; with its head , its leg@@ s and its in@@ ner parts .
you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall bur@@ n with fire .
this is how you shall eat it : with your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , your sho@@ es on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in has@@ te : it is Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordin@@ ance fore@@ ver .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
the children of Israel went and did so ; as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded Mos@@ es and Aaron , so they did .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
he called for Mos@@ es and Aaron by night , and said , " R@@ ise up , get out from among my people , both you and the children of Israel ; and go , serve Yah@@ we@@ h , as you have said !
the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in has@@ te , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
the children of Israel did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and they asked of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing .
they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it was@@ n '@@ t le@@ av@@ ened , because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yah@@ we@@ h went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yah@@ we@@ h for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yah@@ we@@ h , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
but every man 's ser@@ vant who is bought for money , when you have circum@@ c@@ ised him , then shall he eat of it .
Un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten throughout the seven days ; and no le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be seen with you , neither shall ye@@ ast be seen with you , in all your borders .
you shall tell your son in that day , saying , ' It is because of that which Yah@@ we@@ h did for me when I came out of Egypt . '
" it shall be , when Yah@@ we@@ h shall bring you into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , as he s@@ wor@@ e to you and to your fa@@ thers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Yah@@ we@@ h all that opens the w@@ om@@ b , and every fir@@ st@@ born which you have that comes from an animal . the mal@@ es shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's .
but God led the people around by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
they took their journey from Suc@@ co@@ th , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Eth@@ am , in the edge of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
Yah@@ we@@ h har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were mar@@ ching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
lift up your ro@@ d , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the mid@@ st of the sea on d@@ ry ground .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , and Yah@@ we@@ h caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea d@@ ry land , and the waters were divided .
the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans pursu@@ ed , and went in after them into the mid@@ st of the sea : all of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hor@@ ses , his char@@ i@@ ots , and his hor@@ se@@ men .
it happened in the morning watch , that Yah@@ we@@ h looked out on the Egyptian army through the pil@@ lar of fire and of cl@@ oud , and conf@@ used the Egyptian army .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it . Yah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the char@@ i@@ ots and the hor@@ se@@ men , even all P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Mos@@ es and the children of Israel san@@ g this song to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " I will sing to Yah@@ we@@ h , for he has tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously . the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der he has thrown into the sea .
Y@@ ah is my strength and song . he has become my sal@@ vation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will ex@@ alt him .
in the gre@@ at@@ ness of your exc@@ el@@ len@@ cy , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wr@@ ath . it consu@@ mes them as st@@ ub@@ ble .
with the blast of your nos@@ tr@@ ils , the waters were p@@ iled up . the floods stood u@@ pri@@ ght as a he@@ ap . the deep@@ s were con@@ ge@@ aled in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , ' I will pursue . I will over@@ take . I will divide the sp@@ oil . my desire shall be satisfied on them . I will draw my s@@ word , my hand shall destroy them . '
" you , in your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , have led the people that you have re@@ deemed . you have gui@@ ded them in your strength to your hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
then the chiefs of E@@ dom were dis@@ may@@ ed . Tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling takes hold of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Mo@@ a@@ b . all the inhabitants of Can@@ a@@ an are mel@@ ted away .
terror and dre@@ ad falls on them . by the gre@@ at@@ ness of your arm they are as still as a st@@ on@@ e@@ -- until your people pass over , Yah@@ we@@ h , until the people pass over who you have purchased .
Mi@@ ri@@ am the pro@@ phe@@ tes@@ s , the sister of Aaron , took a tam@@ bour@@ ine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tam@@ bour@@ ines and with dan@@ ces .
Mos@@ es led Israel on@@ ward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Sh@@ ur ; and they went three days in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and found no water .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Mos@@ es and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Yah@@ we@@ h has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared in the cl@@ oud .
it happened at evening that qu@@ ail came up and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp .
when the dew that lay had gone , be@@ hold , on the sur@@ face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness was a small round thing , small as the F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
when they meas@@ ured it with an O@@ mer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to Mos@@ es , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and became f@@ oul : and Mos@@ es was angry with them .
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for each one , and all the rul@@ ers of the Con@@ gre@@ gation came and told Mos@@ es .
they laid it up until the morning , as Mos@@ es asked , and it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t become f@@ oul , neither was there any wor@@ m in it .
be@@ hold , because Yah@@ we@@ h has given you the Sab@@ b@@ ath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
the children of Israel ate the man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the man@@ na until they came to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel trav@@ eled from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , by their jour@@ neys , according to Yah@@ we@@ h 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Rep@@ hi@@ dim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
the people were thir@@ st@@ y for water there ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es , and said , " Wh@@ y have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck with thir@@ st ? "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " Wal@@ k on before the people , and take the el@@ ders of Israel with you , and take the ro@@ d in your hand with which you struck the N@@ ile , and go .
so Jos@@ hua did as Mos@@ es had told him , and fought with A@@ mal@@ ek ; and Mos@@ es , Aaron , and H@@ ur went up to the top of the hill .
it happened , when Mos@@ es held up his hand , that Israel prev@@ ailed ; and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prev@@ ailed .
Mos@@ es went out to meet his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and bo@@ wed and k@@ is@@ sed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Mos@@ es told his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law all that Yah@@ we@@ h had done to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , all the hard@@ ships that had come on them on the way , and how Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them .
J@@ eth@@ ro re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed for all the Go@@ od@@ ness which Yah@@ we@@ h had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God . Aaron came with all of the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law before God .

you shall te@@ ach them the stat@@ utes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
if you will do this thing , and God comman@@ ds you so , then you will be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
so Mos@@ es list@@ ened to the voice of his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and did all that he had said .
Mos@@ es chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rul@@ ers of thousands , rul@@ ers of hundreds , rul@@ ers of fif@@ ties , and rul@@ ers of tens .
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
when they had depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and had come to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , they en@@ camp@@ ed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel en@@ camp@@ ed before the mountain .
Mos@@ es went up to God , and Yah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel :

Yah@@ we@@ h came down on Mount S@@ ina@@ i , to the top of the mountain . Yah@@ we@@ h called Mos@@ es to the top of the mountain , and Mos@@ es went up .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " G@@ o down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don '@@ t let the pri@@ ests and the people break through to come up to Yah@@ we@@ h , lest he break forth on them . "
" you shall not make for yo@@ ur@@ selves an i@@ dol , nor any image of anything that is in the heav@@ ens above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
all the people perceived the th@@ under@@ ings , the ligh@@ t@@ nings , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and stayed at a distance .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " This is what you shall tell the children of Israel : ' you yo@@ ur@@ selves have seen that I have talked with you from heav@@ en .

Mos@@ es came and told the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all the ord@@ inan@@ ces ; and all the people answ@@ ered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken will we do . "
he took the book of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken will we do , and be obe@@ di@@ ent . "
Mos@@ es took the blood , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led it on the people , and said , " Lo@@ ok , this is the blood of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which Yah@@ we@@ h has made with you concerning all these words . "

you shall do this to them , to cleans@@ e them : sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le the water of cleansing on them , let them s@@ have their whole bodies with a ra@@ zor , and let them was@@ h their clo@@ th@@ es , and cleans@@ e themselves .
and Aaron shall offer the L@@ evi@@ tes before Yah@@ we@@ h for a wave offering , on the behalf of the children of Israel , that it may be the@@ ir@@ s to do the service of Yah@@ we@@ h .
" the L@@ evi@@ tes shall lay their hands on the heads of the bul@@ ls , and you shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , to make At@@ on@@ ement for the L@@ evi@@ tes .
you shall set the L@@ evi@@ tes before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them as a wave offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
" after that , the L@@ evi@@ tes shall go in to do the service of the tent of Meet@@ ing : and you shall cleans@@ e them , and offer them as a wave offering .
for they are wh@@ ol@@ ly given to me from among the children of Israel ; instead of all who open the w@@ om@@ b , even the fir@@ st@@ born of all the children of Israel , I have taken them to me .
for all the fir@@ st@@ born among the children of Israel are mine , both man and animal . on the day that I struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , I sanc@@ ti@@ fied them for myself .
the L@@ evi@@ tes pur@@ ified themselves from sin , and they was@@ hed their clo@@ th@@ es ; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and Aaron made At@@ on@@ ement for them to cleans@@ e them .
" this is that which belongs to the L@@ evi@@ tes : from twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old and up@@ ward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of Meet@@ ing ;
but shall minister with their brothers in the tent of Meet@@ ing , to perform the duty , and shall do no service . you shall do thus to the L@@ evi@@ tes concerning their duties . "
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
they kept the P@@ ass@@ over in the first month , on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , at evening , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i . according to all that Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , so the children of Israel did .
there were certain men , who were un@@ clean because of the dead body of a man , so that they could not keep the P@@ ass@@ over on that day , and they came before Mos@@ es and before Aaron on that day .
they shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone of it . according to all the statute of the P@@ ass@@ over they shall keep it .
wh@@ en@@ ever the cl@@ oud was taken up from over the tent , then after that the children of Israel trav@@ eled ; and in the place where the cl@@ oud remained , there the children of Israel en@@ camp@@ ed .
at the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , the children of Israel trav@@ eled , and at the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h they en@@ camp@@ ed . as long as the cl@@ oud remained on the tab@@ ern@@ acle they remained en@@ camp@@ ed .
" make two tr@@ ump@@ ets of silver . you shall make them of beaten work . you shall use them for the calling of the Con@@ gre@@ gation , and for the jour@@ ne@@ ying of the camps .
the children of Israel went forward according to their jour@@ neys out of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i ; and the cl@@ oud stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went forward according to their armies . N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ a@@ b was over his army .
N@@ eth@@ an@@ el the son of Zu@@ ar was over the army of the tri@@ be of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har .
the tab@@ ern@@ acle was taken down ; and the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on and the sons of Mer@@ ari , who b@@ ore the tab@@ ern@@ acle , went forward .
the standard of the camp of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im set forward according to their armies . E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ m@@ ih@@ ud was over his army .
G@@ am@@ ali@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ah@@ z@@ ur was over the army of the tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the standard of the camp of the children of Dan , which was the re@@ ar guard of all the camps , set forward according to their armies . A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er the son of Am@@ mis@@ h@@ ad@@ da@@ i was over his army .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
it shall be , if you go with us , yes , it shall be , that whatever good Yah@@ we@@ h does to us , we will do the same to you . "
they set forward from the Mount of Yah@@ we@@ h three days ' journey . the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the Ar@@ k went forward , that Mos@@ es said , " R@@ ise up , Yah@@ we@@ h , and let your enem@@ ies be sc@@ at@@ tered ! let those who h@@ ate you flee before you ! "
the people were compla@@ ining in the e@@ ars of Yah@@ we@@ h . when Yah@@ we@@ h heard it , his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led ; and Yah@@ we@@ h 's fire bur@@ n@@ t among them , and consu@@ med some of the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the camp .
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , and the mel@@ ons , and the le@@ eks , and the on@@ ions , and the gar@@ lic ;
Mos@@ es heard the people we@@ eping throughout their families , every man at the door of his tent ; and the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led greatly ; and Mos@@ es was disp@@ le@@ ased .
if you treat me this way , ple@@ ase kill me right now , if I have found fav@@ or in your sight ; and don '@@ t let me see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edn@@ ess . "
shall f@@ loc@@ ks and her@@ ds be sla@@ ug@@ h@@ tered for them , to be sufficient for them ? shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to be sufficient for them ? "
Mos@@ es went out , and told the people the words of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he gathered sev@@ enty men of the el@@ ders of the people , and set them around the tent .
while the f@@ les@@ h was yet between their te@@ eth , before it was che@@ wed , the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against the people , and Yah@@ we@@ h struck the people with a very great pla@@ gue .
Mi@@ ri@@ am and Aaron spoke against Mos@@ es because of the C@@ ush@@ ite woman whom he had married ; for he had married a C@@ ush@@ ite woman .
now the man Mos@@ es was very hum@@ ble , above all the men who were on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h came down in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud , and stood at the door of the tent , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am ; and they both came forward .
with him I will speak m@@ outh to m@@ outh , even pla@@ in@@ ly , and not in rid@@ d@@ les ; and he shall see Yah@@ we@@ h 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my ser@@ vant , against Mos@@ es ? "
Aaron said to Mos@@ es , " O@@ h , my lor@@ d , ple@@ ase don '@@ t count this sin against us , in which we have done fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly , and in which we have sin@@ ned .
let her not , I pra@@ y , be as one dead , of whom the f@@ les@@ h is half consu@@ med when he comes out of his mother 's w@@ om@@ b . "
Mos@@ es sent them from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Par@@ an according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h : all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel .
Mos@@ es sent them to sp@@ y out the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and said to them , " G@@ o up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
and what the land is that they d@@ well in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they d@@ well in , whether in camps , or in stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ;
they went up by the South , and came to He@@ br@@ on ; and Ah@@ im@@ an , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak , were there . ( now He@@ br@@ on was built seven years before Zo@@ an in Egypt . )
they came to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from there a branch with one cl@@ us@@ ter of grap@@ es , and they b@@ ore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates and fig@@ s .
that place was called the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , because of the cl@@ us@@ ter which the children of Israel cut down from there .
all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Mos@@ es and against Aaron : and the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation said to them , " Wo@@ uld that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness !
Jos@@ hua the son of nun and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , who were of those who sp@@ ied out the land , t@@ ore their clo@@ th@@ es :

but all the Con@@ gre@@ gation threatened to stone them with stones . the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared in the tent of Meet@@ ing to all the children of Israel .
ple@@ ase par@@ don the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of this people according to the gre@@ at@@ ness of your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , and according as you have for@@ given this people , from Egypt even until now . "

I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken , su@@ rely this will I do to all this ev@@ il Con@@ gre@@ gation , who are gathered together against me : in this w@@ il@@ der@@ ness they shall be consu@@ med , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Mos@@ es sent to sp@@ y out the land , who returned , and made all the Con@@ gre@@ gation to mur@@ mur against him , by bringing up an ev@@ il report against the land ,
but Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , remained alive of those men who went to sp@@ y out the land .
for there the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite are before you , and you shall fall by the s@@ word : because you are turned back from following Yah@@ we@@ h , therefore Yah@@ we@@ h will not be with you . "

" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your habi@@ tations , which I give to you ,

is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , to kill us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , but you must also make yo@@ ur@@ self a pr@@ ince over us ?
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , saying ,
it happened , as he made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground split apart that was under them ;
and the ear@@ th opened its m@@ outh , and sw@@ allowed them up , and their households , and all the men who ap@@ per@@ tained to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .

Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es , saying ,

to the more you shall give the more inher@@ it@@ ance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inher@@ it@@ ance : to everyone according to those who were num@@ ber@@ ed of him shall his inher@@ it@@ ance be given .

" our father died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yah@@ we@@ h in the company of Kor@@ ah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
" the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had speak right : you shall su@@ rely give them a possession of an inher@@ it@@ ance among their father 's brothers ; and you shall cause the inher@@ it@@ ance of their father to pass to them .

Mos@@ es spoke to Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
you shall put of your hon@@ or on him , that all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel may obe@@ y .
you shall tell them , ' This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to Yah@@ we@@ h : male lam@@ bs a year old without ble@@ mis@@ h , two day by day , for a contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering .

Mos@@ es spoke to the heads of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Yah@@ we@@ h has comman@@ ded .
when a man vows a vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h , or swe@@ ars an oath to bin@@ d his sou@@ l with a bond , he shall not break his word ; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his m@@ outh .
" also when a woman vows a vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h , and bin@@ ds her@@ self by a bond , being in her father 's house , in her youth ,
" if she has a husband , while her vows are on her , or the ras@@ h ut@@ ter@@ ance of her li@@ ps , with which she has bound her sou@@ l ,
and her husband he@@ ars it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he he@@ ars it ; then her vows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dis@@ allow her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond with which she bound her sou@@ l shall stand .
these are the stat@@ utes , which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , being in her youth , in her father 's house .
Mos@@ es sent them , one thousand of every tri@@ be , to the war , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , to the war , with the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary and the tr@@ ump@@ ets for the alarm in his hand .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their en@@ camp@@ ments , they bur@@ n@@ t with fire .
Mos@@ es was angry with the officers of the army , the cap@@ tains of thousands and the cap@@ tains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war .
be@@ hold , these caused the children of Israel , through the coun@@ sel of Bal@@ a@@ am , to commit t@@ res@@ pass against Yah@@ we@@ h in the matter of Pe@@ or , and so the pla@@ gue was among the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Yah@@ we@@ h .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
" En@@ camp outside of the camp seven days : who@@ ever has killed any person , and who@@ ever has touched any sla@@ in , pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your cap@@ tives .
as to every gar@@ ment , and all that is made of s@@ kin , and all work of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir , and all things made of wood , you shall pur@@ ify yo@@ ur@@ selves . "
you shall was@@ h your clo@@ th@@ es on the seventh day , and you shall be clean ; and after@@ ward you shall come into the camp . "
" take the sum of the pre@@ y that was taken , both of man and of animal , you , and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the Con@@ gre@@ gation ;
and divide the pre@@ y into two parts : between the men skilled in war , who went out to battle , and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation .
now the pre@@ y , over and above the bo@@ o@@ ty which the men of war took , was six hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand she@@ ep ,
and thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand persons in all , of the women who had not known man by lying with him .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand five hundred she@@ ep :
the officers who were over the thousands of the army , the cap@@ tains of thousands , and the cap@@ tains of hundreds , came near to Mos@@ es ;
and they said to Mos@@ es , " Y@@ our servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command , and there lacks not one man of us .
all the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yah@@ we@@ h , of the cap@@ tains of thousands , and of the cap@@ tains of hundreds , was six@@ teen thousand seven hundred fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els .
Mos@@ es and Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est took the gold of the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of Meet@@ ing , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yah@@ we@@ h .
they said , " If we have found fav@@ or in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don '@@ t bring us over the Jordan . "
for when they went up to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they dis@@ cour@@ aged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Yah@@ we@@ h had given them .
Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he made them w@@ ander back and forth in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness for@@ ty years , until all the generation , who had done ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , was consu@@ med .
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall d@@ well in the for@@ ti@@ fied cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inher@@ it@@ ance .
for we will not inher@@ it with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inher@@ it@@ ance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eas@@ tw@@ ard . "
and the land is sub@@ du@@ ed before Yah@@ we@@ h ; then after@@ ward you shall return , and be guil@@ t@@ less towards Yah@@ we@@ h , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Mos@@ es comman@@ ded concerning them to Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , and to the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel .
the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en answ@@ ered , saying , " As Yah@@ we@@ h has said to your servants , so will we do .
the children of G@@ ad built Di@@ bon , and A@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and A@@ ro@@ er ,
the children of Re@@ ub@@ en built H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
these are the jour@@ neys of the children of Israel , when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Mos@@ es and Aaron .
Mos@@ es wrote their go@@ ings out according to their jour@@ neys by the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h : and these are their jour@@ neys according to their go@@ ings out .
they trav@@ eled from Ra@@ mes@@ es in the first month , on the fif@@ teen@@ th day of the first month ; on the next day after the P@@ ass@@ over the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ,
they trav@@ eled from before Ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , and passed through the mid@@ st of the sea into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : and they went three days ' journey in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Eth@@ am , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Mar@@ ah .
they trav@@ eled from Mar@@ ah , and came to E@@ lim : and in E@@ lim were twelve spr@@ ings of water , and sev@@ enty pal@@ m trees ; and they en@@ camp@@ ed there .
they trav@@ eled from K@@ ade@@ sh , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Mount H@@ or , in the edge of the land of E@@ dom .
the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the king of Ara@@ d , who lived in the South in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , " When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone id@@ ols , destroy all their m@@ ol@@ ten images , and demol@@ ish all their high places .
then your south quarter shall be from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in along by the side of E@@ dom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Sal@@ t Sea eas@@ tw@@ ard ;
and the border shall turn about from Az@@ mon to the Bro@@ ok of Egypt , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the sea .
" ' this shall be your north border : from the great sea you shall mark out for you Mount H@@ or ;

and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the Sal@@ t Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
" these are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inher@@ it@@ ance : Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est , and Jos@@ hua the son of nun .
of the children of Joseph : of the tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h a pr@@ ince , H@@ anni@@ el the son of E@@ pho@@ d .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the L@@ evi@@ tes of the inher@@ it@@ ance of their possession cities to d@@ well in ; and you shall give subur@@ bs for the cities around them to the L@@ evi@@ tes .
the cities shall they have to d@@ well in ; and their subur@@ bs shall be for their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and for their sub@@ stance , and for all their animals .
" the subur@@ bs of the cities , which you shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes , shall be from the wall of the city and ou@@ tw@@ ard one thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes , they shall be the six cities of ref@@ uge , which you shall give for the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er to flee to : and besides them you shall give for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two cities .
all the cities which you shall give to the L@@ evi@@ tes shall be for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight cities together with their subur@@ bs .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ,
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; they shall be cities of ref@@ uge .
for the children of Israel , and for the st@@ ran@@ ger and for the foreig@@ ner living among them , shall these six cities be for ref@@ uge ; that everyone who kills any person un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly may flee there .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a mur@@ der@@ er : the mur@@ der@@ er shall su@@ rely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a mur@@ der@@ er : the mur@@ der@@ er shall su@@ rely be put to death .
the av@@ eng@@ er of blood shall himself put the mur@@ der@@ er to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
" ' but if the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of ref@@ uge , where he fle@@ es ,
and the av@@ eng@@ er of blood find him outside of the border of his city of ref@@ uge , and the av@@ eng@@ er of blood kill the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of ref@@ uge until the death of the high pri@@ est : but after the death of the high pri@@ est the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' who@@ ever kills any person , the mur@@ der@@ er shall be sla@@ in at the m@@ outh of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
" ' moreover you shall take no ran@@ so@@ m for the life of a mur@@ der@@ er who is guilty of death ; but he shall su@@ rely be put to death .
" ' you shall take no ran@@ so@@ m for him who is fled to his city of ref@@ uge , that he may come again to d@@ well in the land , until the death of the pri@@ est .
and they said , " Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded my lor@@ d to give the land for inher@@ it@@ ance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lor@@ d was comman@@ ded by Yah@@ we@@ h to give the inher@@ it@@ ance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother to his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
this is the thing which Yah@@ we@@ h does command concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tri@@ be of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Israel remove from tri@@ be to tri@@ be ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of his fa@@ thers .
so shall no inher@@ it@@ ance remove from one tri@@ be to another tri@@ be ; for the tri@@ bes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inher@@ it@@ ance . "
the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had did as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es :
they were married into the families of the sons of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph ; and their inher@@ it@@ ance remained in the tri@@ be of the family of their father .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fa@@ thers , make you a thousand times as many as you are , and b@@ less you , as he has promised you !
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , which Yah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us .
and they turned and went up into the hill country , and came to the val@@ ley of E@@ sh@@ col , and sp@@ ied it out .
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Yah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us . "
who went before you in the way , to seek you out a place to pit@@ ch your ten@@ ts in , in fire by night , to show you by what way you should go , and in the cl@@ oud by day .
Jos@@ hua the son of nun , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inher@@ it it .
the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who lived in that hill country , came out against you , and ch@@ ased you , as be@@ es do , and beat you down in Se@@ ir , even to Hor@@ ma@@ h .
then we turned , and took our journey into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way to the Red Sea , as Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to me ; and we en@@ circ@@ led Mount Se@@ ir many days .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to me , saying ,
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of E@@ sa@@ u , who d@@ well in Se@@ ir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves therefore ;
D@@ on '@@ t conten@@ d with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as for the sole of the fo@@ ot to tre@@ ad on ; because I have given Mount Se@@ ir to E@@ sa@@ u for a possession .
so we passed by from our brothers the children of E@@ sa@@ u , who d@@ well in Se@@ ir , from the way of the Ara@@ bah from E@@ la@@ th and from E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber . we turned and passed by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Mo@@ a@@ b .
moreover the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against them , to destroy them from the mid@@ st of the camp , until they were consu@@ med .
so it happened , when all the men of war were consu@@ med and dead from among the people ,
and the Av@@ vi@@ m , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ im , who came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" let me pass through your land : I will go along by the highway , I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left .
only the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck we took for a pre@@ y to ourselves , with the sp@@ oil of the cities which we had taken .
only to the land of the children of Am@@ mon you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come near ; all the side of the river J@@ ab@@ bo@@ k , and the cities of the hill country , and wher@@ ever Yah@@ we@@ h our God for@@ b@@ ade us .
then we turned , and went up the way to B@@ ash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
but all the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the sp@@ oil of the cities , we took for a pre@@ y to ourselves .
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes who were beyond the Jordan , from the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon .
this land we took in possession at that time : from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and half the hill country of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and its cities , gave I to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ adi@@ tes :
the Ara@@ bah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ eth even to the sea of the Ara@@ bah , the Sal@@ t Sea , under the s@@ lop@@ es of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard .
I comman@@ ded Jos@@ hua at that time , saying , " Y@@ our eyes have seen all that Yah@@ we@@ h your God has done to these two kings : so shall Yah@@ we@@ h do to all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms where you go over .
go up to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , and lift up your eyes w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eas@@ tw@@ ard , and see with your eyes : for you shall not go over this Jordan .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you dimin@@ ish from it , that you may keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God which I command you .
be@@ hold , I have ta@@ ught you stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces , even as Yah@@ we@@ h my God comman@@ ded me , that you should do so in the mid@@ st of the land where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you out of the mid@@ st of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , which he comman@@ ded you to perform , even the ten comman@@ d@@ ments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded me at that time to te@@ ach you stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces , that you might do them in the land where you go over to poss@@ ess it .
take therefore good heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves ; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to you in Ho@@ re@@ b out of the mid@@ st of the fire .
furthermore Yah@@ we@@ h was angry with me for your sak@@ es , and s@@ wor@@ e that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance :
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest you forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which he made with you , and make you an en@@ gra@@ ved image in the form of anything which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has for@@ bid@@ den you .
but from there you shall seek Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall find him , when you search after him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
when you are in op@@ pression , and all these things have come on you , in the latter days you shall return to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and listen to his voice :
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is a mer@@ ci@@ ful God ; he will not fail you , neither destroy you , nor forget the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of your fa@@ thers which he s@@ wor@@ e to them .
that the man@@ s@@ lay@@ er might flee there , who kills his neigh@@ bor un@@ awar@@ es , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t h@@ ate him in time past ; and that fle@@ eing to one of these cities he might live :
these are the testimon@@ ies , and the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Mos@@ es spoke to the children of Israel , when they came forth out of Egypt ,
they took his land in possession , and the land of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sun@@ rise ;
Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t make this C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with our fa@@ thers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Yah@@ we@@ h and you at that time , to show you the word of Yah@@ we@@ h : for you were afraid because of the fire , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" you shall not make an en@@ gra@@ ved image for yo@@ ur@@ self , any lik@@ eness of what is in heav@@ en above , or what is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consum@@ e us : if we hear the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God any more , then we shall die .
go near , and hear all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall say : and tell us all that Yah@@ we@@ h our God shall tell you ; and we will hear it , and do it . "
O@@ h that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my comman@@ d@@ ments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children fore@@ ver !
you shall observe to do therefore as Yah@@ we@@ h your God has comman@@ ded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has comman@@ ded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prol@@ ong your days in the land which you shall poss@@ ess .
now this is the comman@@ d@@ ment , the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ded to te@@ ach you , that you might do them in the land where you go over to poss@@ ess it ;
and you shall love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , and with all your might .
and you shall te@@ ach them dil@@ ig@@ ently to your children , and shall talk of them when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God in the mid@@ st of you is a Je@@ al@@ ous God ; lest the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h your God be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he destroy you from off the face of the ear@@ th .
you shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and his testimon@@ ies , and his stat@@ utes , which he has comman@@ ded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and poss@@ ess the good land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers ,
when your son asks you in time to come , saying , " What do the testimon@@ ies , the stat@@ utes , and the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which Yah@@ we@@ h our God has comman@@ ded you mean ? "
then you shall tell your son , " We were P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's bon@@ d@@ servants in Egypt : and Yah@@ we@@ h brought us out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand ;
neither shall you make marri@@ ages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other go@@ ds : so the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h would be kin@@ d@@ led against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s , and d@@ ash their pil@@ lars in pieces , and cut down their Ash@@ er@@ im , and bur@@ n their en@@ gra@@ ved images with fire .
for you are a hol@@ y people to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : Yah@@ we@@ h your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the ear@@ th .
Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fe@@ west of all peoples :
know therefore that Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God , the fa@@ ith@@ ful God , who keeps C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness with them who love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments to a thousand generations ,
and rep@@ ays those who h@@ ate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be S@@ lack to him who ha@@ tes him , he will repay him to his face .
Yah@@ we@@ h will take away from you all si@@ ck@@ ness ; and none of the ev@@ il diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who h@@ ate you .
you shall consum@@ e all the peoples whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not p@@ ity them : neither shall you serve their go@@ ds ; for that will be a sn@@ are to you .
you shall not be afraid of them : you shall well remember what Yah@@ we@@ h your God did to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and to all Egypt ;
moreover Yah@@ we@@ h your God will send the hor@@ net among them , until those who are left , and hide themselves , per@@ ish from before you .
you shall not be scar@@ ed of them ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God is in the mid@@ st of you , a great and aw@@ es@@ ome God .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little : you may not consum@@ e them at once , lest the animals of the field increase on you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to per@@ ish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall observe to do all the comman@@ d@@ ment which I command you this day , that you may live , and multi@@ ply , and go in and poss@@ ess the land which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers .
a land in which you shall eat bread without scar@@ cen@@ ess , you shall not lack anything in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hil@@ ls you may di@@ g cop@@ per .
be@@ w@@ are lest you forget Yah@@ we@@ h your God , in not keeping his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , and his stat@@ utes , which I command you this day :
lest , when you have e@@ aten and are full , and have built good@@ ly houses , and lived there@@ in ;
and when your her@@ ds and your f@@ loc@@ ks multi@@ ply , and your silver and your gold is multi@@ p@@ lied , and all that you have is multi@@ p@@ lied ;
then your heart be lifted up , and you forget Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge ;
who led you through the great and ter@@ ri@@ ble w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , with fi@@ ery Ser@@ pen@@ ts and S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions , and thir@@ st@@ y ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of F@@ lin@@ t ;
who f@@ ed you in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness with man@@ na , which your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know ; that he might hum@@ ble you , and that he might prove you , to do you good at your latter end :
and lest you say in your heart , " My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth . "
but you shall remember Yah@@ we@@ h your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers , as at this day .
as the nations that Yah@@ we@@ h makes to per@@ ish before you , so you shall per@@ ish ; because you wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
a people great and t@@ all , the sons of the An@@ ak@@ im , whom you know , and of whom you have heard say , " Wh@@ o can stand before the sons of An@@ ak ? "
it came to pass at the end of for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights , that Yah@@ we@@ h gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blo@@ t out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant were in my two hands .
I looked , and be@@ hold , you had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; you had made yo@@ ur@@ selves a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded you .
I took hold of the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and broke them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the an@@ ger and hot disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , with which Yah@@ we@@ h was angry against you to destroy you . but Yah@@ we@@ h list@@ ened to me that time also .
remember your servants , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , I@@ sa@@ ac , and Jac@@ o@@ b ; don '@@ t look to the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of this people , nor to their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor to their sin ,
I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke , and you shall put them in the Ar@@ k . "
I turned and came down from the mountain , and put the tables in the Ar@@ k which I had made ; and there they are as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded me .
( the children of Israel trav@@ eled from Be@@ ero@@ th B@@ ene Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ er@@ ah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ azar his son minist@@ ered in the pri@@ est 's office in his place .
for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God of go@@ ds , and Lord of lor@@ ds , the great God , the m@@ igh@@ ty , and the aw@@ es@@ ome , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect persons , nor takes reward .
know this day : for I don '@@ t speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , his gre@@ at@@ ness , his m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and his out@@ stret@@ ched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the mid@@ st of Egypt to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
therefore you shall keep all the comman@@ d@@ ment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and poss@@ ess the land , where you go over to poss@@ ess it ;
and that you may prol@@ ong your days in the land , which Yah@@ we@@ h s@@ wor@@ e to your fa@@ thers to give to them and to their se@@ ed , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey .
but the land , where you go over to poss@@ ess it , is a land of hil@@ ls and val@@ ley@@ s which drin@@ ks water of the rain of the sky ,
a land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God car@@ es for : the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h your God are always on it , from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year .
it shall happen , if you shall listen dil@@ ig@@ ently to my comman@@ d@@ ments which I command you this day , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l ,
that I will give the rain of your land in its season , the former rain and the latter rain , that you may gather in your gra@@ in , and your new wine , and your oil .
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ selves , lest your heart be dec@@ e@@ ived , and you turn aside , and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your sou@@ l ; and you shall bin@@ d them for a sign on your hand , and they shall be for symbols between your eyes .
you shall te@@ ach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
for if you shall dil@@ ig@@ ently keep all this comman@@ d@@ ment which I command you , to do it , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place where@@ on the sole of your fo@@ ot shall tre@@ ad shall be yo@@ urs : from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , even to the hin@@ der sea shall be your border .
the b@@ les@@ sing , if you shall listen to the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day ;
it shall happen , when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall bring you into the land where you go to poss@@ ess it , that you shall set the b@@ les@@ sing on Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the cur@@ se on Mount E@@ bal .
for you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , and you shall poss@@ ess it , and d@@ well there@@ in .
you shall su@@ rely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess served their go@@ ds , on the high mountains , and on the hil@@ ls , and under every green tree :
but to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose out of all your tri@@ bes , to put his name there , even to his habi@@ tation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall eat before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has b@@ les@@ sed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but when you go over the Jordan , and d@@ well in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God causes you to inher@@ it , and he gives you rest from all your enem@@ ies around you , so that you d@@ well in safety ;
but in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose in one of your tri@@ bes , there you shall offer your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
take heed to yo@@ ur@@ self that you don '@@ t for@@ sake the Lev@@ ite as long as you live in your land .
even as the gaz@@ elle and as the har@@ t is e@@ aten , so you shall eat of it : the un@@ clean and the clean may eat of it alike .
only your hol@@ y things which you have , and your vows , you shall take , and go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose :
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you fore@@ ver , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dis@@ poss@@ ess them , and you dis@@ poss@@ ess them , and d@@ well in their land ;
you shall not do so to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : for every ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , which he ha@@ tes , have they done to their go@@ ds ; for even their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters do they bur@@ n in the fire to their go@@ ds .
you shall not listen to the words of that pro@@ phe@@ t , or to that dre@@ amer of dre@@ ams : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God proves you , to know whether you love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart and with all your sou@@ l .
you shall not consent to him , nor listen to him ; neither shall your eye p@@ ity him , neither shall you spar@@ e , neither shall you conce@@ al him :
but you shall su@@ rely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge .
then you shall inqu@@ ire , and make search , and ask dil@@ ig@@ ently ; and , be@@ hold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ omin@@ ation is done in the mid@@ st of you ,
you shall su@@ rely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the s@@ word , destroying it ut@@ ter@@ ly , and all that is there@@ in and its li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , with the edge of the s@@ word .
for you are a hol@@ y people to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and Yah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the ear@@ th .
the har@@ t , and the gaz@@ elle , and the ro@@ e@@ bu@@ ck , and the wild go@@ at , and the i@@ be@@ x , and the an@@ tel@@ ope , and the ch@@ am@@ o@@ is .
every animal that parts the ho@@ of , and has the ho@@ of cl@@ ov@@ en in two and che@@ ws the cu@@ d , among the animals , that may you eat .
the pi@@ g , because it has a split ho@@ of but do@@ es@@ n '@@ t ch@@ ew the cu@@ d , is un@@ clean to you : of their f@@ les@@ h you shall not eat , and their car@@ c@@ ass@@ es you shall not touch .
and the red k@@ ite , and the fal@@ c@@ on , and the k@@ ite after its kind ,
then you shall turn it into money , and bin@@ d up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose :
at the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the ti@@ the of your increase in the same year , and shall lay it up within your gates :
this is the way of the release : every credi@@ tor shall release that which he has l@@ ent to his neigh@@ bor ; he shall not exact it of his neigh@@ bor and his brother ; because Yah@@ we@@ h 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreig@@ ner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
if a poor man , one of your brothers , is with you within any of your gates in your land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , you shall not har@@ den your heart , nor shut your hand from your poor brother ;
but you shall su@@ rely open your hand to him , and shall su@@ rely lend him sufficient for his need , which he lacks .
you shall fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of your flock , and out of your th@@ res@@ hing floor , and out of your win@@ e@@ press ; as Yah@@ we@@ h your God has b@@ les@@ sed you , you shall give to him .
you shall remember that you were a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant in the land of Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God re@@ deemed you : therefore I command you this thing today .
all the fir@@ st@@ born mal@@ es that are born of your her@@ d and of your flock you shall sanc@@ ti@@ fy to Yah@@ we@@ h your God : you shall do no work with the fir@@ st@@ born of your her@@ d , nor s@@ hear the fir@@ st@@ born of your flock .
observe the month of A@@ bi@@ b , and keep the P@@ ass@@ over to Yah@@ we@@ h your God ; for in the month of A@@ bi@@ b Yah@@ we@@ h your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night .
you shall sacrifice the P@@ ass@@ over to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , of the flock and the her@@ d , in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose , to cause his name to d@@ well there .
you shall ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : and you shall turn in the morning , and go to your ten@@ ts .
you shall count for yo@@ ur@@ selves seven weeks : from the time you begin to put the si@@ ck@@ le to the standing gra@@ in you shall begin to number seven weeks .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yah@@ we@@ h your God with a tri@@ bute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yah@@ we@@ h your God b@@ les@@ ses you :
every man shall give as he is able , according to the b@@ les@@ sing of Yah@@ we@@ h your God which he has given you .
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , according to your tri@@ bes ; and they shall judge the people with righ@@ te@@ ous judgment .
you shall not w@@ rest justice : you shall not respect persons ; neither shall you take a bribe ; for a bribe does b@@ lin@@ d the eyes of the wise , and per@@ ver@@ t the words of the righ@@ te@@ ous .
you shall not plant for yo@@ ur@@ selves an Ash@@ er@@ ah of any kind of tree bes@@ ide the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , which you shall make for yo@@ ur@@ selves .
you shall not sacrifice to Yah@@ we@@ h your God an o@@ x , or a she@@ ep , in which is a ble@@ mis@@ h , or anything ev@@ il ; for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
and has gone and served other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ ped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not comman@@ ded ;
at the m@@ outh of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the m@@ outh of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death , and after@@ ward the hand of all the people . so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
and you shall come to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inqu@@ ire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall te@@ ach you :
the man who does pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ously , in not list@@ ening to the pri@@ est who stands to minister there before Yah@@ we@@ h your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
you shall su@@ rely set him king over yo@@ ur@@ selves , whom Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreig@@ ner over you , who is not your brother .
it shall be , when he s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , that he shall write him a cop@@ y of this law in a book , out of that which is before the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes :
this shall be the pri@@ ests ' due from the people , from those who offer a sacrifice , whether it be o@@ x or she@@ ep , that they shall give to the pri@@ est the sho@@ ul@@ der , and the two che@@ eks , and the ma@@ w .
if a Lev@@ ite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel , where he lives as a foreig@@ ner , and comes with all the desire of his sou@@ l to the place which Yah@@ we@@ h shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God , as all his brothers the L@@ evi@@ tes do , who stand there before Yah@@ we@@ h .
when you have come into the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , you shall not learn to do after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of those nations .
there shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , one who uses div@@ ination , one who practices sor@@ cer@@ y , or an en@@ chan@@ ter , or a sor@@ cer@@ er ,
you shall be perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
for these nations , that you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess , listen to those who practice sor@@ cer@@ y , and to di@@ vin@@ ers ; but as for you , Yah@@ we@@ h your God has not allowed you so to do .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will raise up to you a pro@@ phe@@ t from the mid@@ st of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
it shall happen , that who@@ ever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
when Yah@@ we@@ h your God shall cut off the nations , whose land Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , and you succeed them , and d@@ well in their cities , and in their houses ;
but if any man ha@@ tes his neigh@@ bor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mort@@ ally so that he dies , and he fle@@ es into one of these cities ;
your eye shall not p@@ ity him , but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with you .
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before Yah@@ we@@ h , before the pri@@ ests and the judges who shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make dil@@ ig@@ ent In@@ qu@@ is@@ ition : and , be@@ hold , if the witness is a false witness , and has testified fal@@ sely against his brother ;
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you .
it shall be , when you draw near to the battle , that the pri@@ est shall approach and speak to the people ,
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people , that they shall appoint cap@@ tains of armies at the head of the people .
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found there@@ in shall become tri@@ but@@ ary to you , and shall serve you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food , you shall destroy and cut them down ; and you shall build bul@@ war@@ ks against the city that makes war with you , until it fall .
if one be found sla@@ in in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to poss@@ ess it , lying in the field , and it is@@ n '@@ t known who has struck him ;
then your el@@ ders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is sla@@ in :
and the el@@ ders of that city shall bring down the he@@ if@@ er to a val@@ ley with running water , which is neither p@@ low@@ ed nor so@@ wn , and shall break the he@@ if@@ er 's nec@@ k there in the val@@ ley .
the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi shall come near ; for them Yah@@ we@@ h your God has chosen to minister to him , and to b@@ less in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stro@@ ke be .
all the el@@ ders of that city , who are near@@ est to the sla@@ in man , shall was@@ h their hands over the he@@ if@@ er whose nec@@ k was broken in the val@@ ley ;
for@@ give , Yah@@ we@@ h , your people Israel , whom you have re@@ deemed , and don '@@ t allow innocent blood in the mid@@ st of your people Israel . " the blood shall be for@@ given them .
so you shall put away the innocent blood from the mid@@ st of you , when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h .
when you go forth to battle against your enem@@ ies , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God deli@@ vers them into your hands , and you carry them away cap@@ tive ,
and see among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
then you shall bring her home to your house ; and she shall s@@ have her head , and par@@ e her n@@ ails ;
if a man have two wi@@ ves , the one bel@@ ov@@ ed , and the other ha@@ ted , and they have bor@@ ne him children , both the bel@@ ov@@ ed and the ha@@ ted ; and if the fir@@ st@@ born son be hers who was ha@@ ted ;
then it shall be , in the day that he causes his sons to inher@@ it that which he has , that he may not make the son of the bel@@ ov@@ ed the fir@@ st@@ born before the son of the ha@@ ted , who is the fir@@ st@@ born :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the el@@ ders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the el@@ ders of his city , " This our son is st@@ ub@@ born and rebel@@ li@@ ous , he will not obe@@ y our voice ; he is a gl@@ ut@@ ton , and a dr@@ un@@ kar@@ d . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from the mid@@ st of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
you shall not see your brother 's don@@ key or his o@@ x fallen down by the way , and hide yo@@ ur@@ self from them : you shall su@@ rely help him to lift them up again .
a woman shall not wear men 's clo@@ thing , neither shall a man put on women 's clo@@ thing ; for who@@ ever does these things is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a batt@@ lement for your ro@@ of , that you don '@@ t bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not so@@ w your v@@ ine@@ yard with two kinds of se@@ ed , lest the whole fruit be for@@ fe@@ ited , the se@@ ed which you have so@@ wn , and the increase of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
then shall the father of the young la@@ dy , and her mother , take and bring forth the to@@ ken@@ s of the young la@@ dy 's vir@@ gin@@ ity to the el@@ ders of the city in the gate ;
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
if there is a young la@@ dy who is a vir@@ gin pledged to be married to a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if the man find the la@@ dy who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the la@@ dy you shall do nothing ; there is in the la@@ dy no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man rises against his neigh@@ bor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
if a man find a la@@ dy who is a vir@@ gin , who is not pledged to be married , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the la@@ dy 's father fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has hum@@ b@@ led her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or from P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se you .
you shall not ab@@ h@@ or an E@@ dom@@ ite ; for he is your brother : you shall not ab@@ h@@ or an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreig@@ ner in his land .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
and you shall have a p@@ add@@ le among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall di@@ g there@@ with , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
you shall not bring the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a do@@ g , into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
when you shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , you shall not be S@@ lack to pay it : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God will su@@ rely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
when you come into your neigh@@ bor 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then you may eat of grap@@ es your fill at your own pleas@@ ure ; but you shall not put any in your ves@@ sel .
take heed in the pla@@ gue of le@@ pro@@ sy , that you observe dil@@ ig@@ ently , and do according to all that the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes shall te@@ ach you : as I comman@@ ded them , so you shall observe to do .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall not op@@ press a hired ser@@ vant who is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
the fa@@ thers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fa@@ thers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
but you shall remember that you were a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant in Egypt , and Yah@@ we@@ h your God re@@ deemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you har@@ v@@ est your v@@ ine@@ yard , you shall not g@@ le@@ an it after yo@@ ur@@ selves : it shall be for the foreig@@ ner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the wi@@ dow .
and it shall be , if the w@@ ic@@ ked man be wor@@ thy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , by number .
for@@ ty stri@@ pes he may give him , he shall not exceed ; lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stri@@ pes , then your brother should seem v@@ ile to you .
it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born whom she be@@ ars shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blo@@ t@@ ted out of Israel .
then the el@@ ders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don '@@ t want to take her " ;
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
how he met you by the way , and struck the hin@@ d@@ most of you , all who were fe@@ e@@ ble behind you , when you were fa@@ int and we@@ ary ; and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear God .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inher@@ it@@ ance , and poss@@ ess it , and d@@ well there@@ in ,
the pri@@ est shall take the bas@@ ket out of your hand , and set it down before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
and we cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of our fa@@ thers , and Yah@@ we@@ h heard our voice , and saw our aff@@ li@@ ction , and our to@@ il , and our op@@ pression ;
and Yah@@ we@@ h brought us forth out of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great terror , and with signs , and with won@@ ders ;
you shall re@@ jo@@ ice in all the good which Yah@@ we@@ h your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you .
look down from your hol@@ y habi@@ tation , from heav@@ en , and b@@ less your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you s@@ wor@@ e to our fa@@ thers , a land flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey . "
this day Yah@@ we@@ h your God comman@@ ds you to do these stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l .
you have declared Yah@@ we@@ h this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , and listen to his voice :
and Yah@@ we@@ h has declared you this day to be a people for his own possession , as he has promised you , and that you should keep all his comman@@ d@@ ments ;
it shall be , when you have passed over the Jordan , that you shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in Mount E@@ bal , and you shall plas@@ ter them with plas@@ ter .
you shall build the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h your God of un@@ cut stones ; and you shall offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings there@@ on to Yah@@ we@@ h your God :
you shall therefore obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and do his comman@@ d@@ ments and his stat@@ utes , which I command you this day . "
and all these b@@ les@@ s@@ ings shall come on you , and over@@ take you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall be b@@ les@@ sed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the young of your flock .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cause your enem@@ ies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
all the peoples of the ear@@ th shall see that you are called by the name of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and they shall be afraid of you .
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other go@@ ds to serve them .
the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the increase of your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and the young of your flock shall be Cur@@ sed .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce cling to you , until he has consu@@ med you from off the land , where you go in to poss@@ ess it .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make the rain of your land pow@@ der and d@@ ust : from the sky shall it come down on you , until you are destroyed .
your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th ; and there shall be none to fri@@ gh@@ ten them away .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you with the bo@@ il of Egypt , and with the t@@ um@@ ors , and with the s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , and with the it@@ ch , of which you can not be he@@ aled .
and you shall gro@@ pe at no@@ on@@ day , as the b@@ lin@@ d gro@@ pes in d@@ ark@@ ness , and you shall not prosp@@ er in your ways : and you shall be only op@@ pressed and ro@@ bbed always , and there shall be none to save you .
you shall bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not d@@ well there@@ in : you shall plant a v@@ ine@@ yard , and shall not use its fruit .
your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with lon@@ ging for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
the fruit of your ground , and all your la@@ b@@ ors , shall a nation which you don '@@ t know eat up ; and you shall be only op@@ pressed and cr@@ us@@ hed always ;
so that you shall be ma@@ d for the sight of your eyes which you shall see .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the k@@ ne@@ es , and in the leg@@ s , with a sor@@ e bo@@ il , of which you can not be he@@ aled , from the sole of your fo@@ ot to the cro@@ wn of your head .
the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t serve Yah@@ we@@ h your God with jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ness , and with gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , by reason of the ab@@ und@@ ance of all things ;
the man who is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this g@@ lor@@ ious and fear@@ ful name , Y@@ A@@ H@@ W@@ E@@ H your God ;
then Yah@@ we@@ h will make your plagu@@ es won@@ der@@ ful , and the plagu@@ es of your se@@ ed , even great plagu@@ es , and of long continu@@ ance , and severe si@@ ck@@ nesses , and of long continu@@ ance .
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every si@@ ck@@ ness , and every pla@@ gue , which is not written in the book of this law , Yah@@ we@@ h will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multi@@ tude ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your fo@@ ot : but Yah@@ we@@ h will give you there a tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling heart , and failing of eyes , and p@@ ining of sou@@ l ;
and your life shall han@@ g in doubt before you ; and you shall fear night and day , and shall have no assur@@ ance of your life .
these are the words of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ a@@ b , besides the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which he made with them in Ho@@ re@@ b .
I have led you for@@ ty years in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness : your clo@@ th@@ es have not grown old on you , and your sho@@ es have not grown old on your feet .
when you came to this place , S@@ ih@@ on the king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and O@@ g the king of B@@ ash@@ an , came out against us to battle , and we struck them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inher@@ it@@ ance to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and to the G@@ adi@@ tes , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of the Man@@ as@@ sites .
that you may enter into the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and into his oath , which Yah@@ we@@ h your God makes with you this day ;
Yah@@ we@@ h will set him apart to ev@@ il out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that is written in this book of the law .
then men shall say , " Bec@@ ause they for@@ so@@ ok the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and Yah@@ we@@ h rooted them out of their land in an@@ ger , and in wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
and shall return to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and shall obe@@ y his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l ;
that then Yah@@ we@@ h your God will turn your cap@@ tivity , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has sc@@ at@@ tered you .
if your out@@ casts are in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the heav@@ ens , from there will Yah@@ we@@ h your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Yah@@ we@@ h your God will bring you into the land which your fa@@ thers poss@@ essed , and you shall poss@@ ess it ; and he will do you good , and multi@@ ply you above your fa@@ thers .
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will circum@@ c@@ ise your heart , and the heart of your se@@ ed , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , that you may live .
but the word is very near to you , in your m@@ outh , and in your heart , that you may do it .
but if your heart turns away , and you will not hear , but shall be drawn away , and worship other go@@ ds , and serve them ;
I den@@ oun@@ ce to you this day , that you shall su@@ rely per@@ ish ; you shall not prol@@ ong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dis@@ poss@@ ess them . Jos@@ hua shall go over before you , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
Yah@@ we@@ h will do to them as he did to S@@ ih@@ on and to O@@ g , the kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
be strong and cour@@ age@@ ous , don '@@ t be afraid , nor be scar@@ ed of them : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor for@@ sake you . "
Yah@@ we@@ h , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither for@@ sake you : D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . "
Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
Mos@@ es comman@@ ded them , saying , " At the end of every seven years , in the set time of the year of release , in the feast of ten@@ ts ,
when all Israel has come to appear before Yah@@ we@@ h your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to poss@@ ess it . "
I will su@@ rely hide my face in that day for all the ev@@ il which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other go@@ ds .
" now therefore write this song for yo@@ ur@@ selves , and te@@ ach it to the children of Israel : put it in their m@@ ou@@ ths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
it happened , when Mos@@ es had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
assem@@ ble to me all the el@@ ders of your tri@@ bes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their e@@ ars , and call heav@@ en and ear@@ th to witness against them .
Mos@@ es spoke in the e@@ ars of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
my doc@@ tr@@ ine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall con@@ den@@ se as the dew , as the small rain on the tender gr@@ ass , as the sho@@ wers on the her@@ b .
remember the days of old . consider the years of many generations . ask your father , and he will show you ; your el@@ ders , and they will tell you .
when the Most High gave to the nations their inher@@ it@@ ance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bo@@ unds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
for Yah@@ we@@ h 's portion is his people . Jac@@ o@@ b is the lot of his inher@@ it@@ ance .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
but J@@ es@@ hur@@ un grew f@@ at , and kicked . you have grown f@@ at . you have grown th@@ ick . you have become sle@@ ek . then he for@@ so@@ ok God who made him , and lightly es@@ te@@ emed the Rock of his sal@@ vation .
they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to dem@@ ons , not God , to go@@ ds that they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know , to new go@@ ds that came up recently , which your fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dre@@ ad .
of the Rock who became your father , you are un@@ min@@ d@@ ful , and have forgotten God who gave you birth .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very per@@ verse generation , children in whom is no fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness .
they shall be was@@ ted with hunger , and dev@@ oured with burning heat and bitter destruction . I will send the te@@ eth of animals on them , With the po@@ ison of cra@@ w@@ ling things of the d@@ ust .
were it not that I fear@@ ed the provoc@@ ation of the enemy , lest their ad@@ vers@@ aries should judge wron@@ gly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is ex@@ al@@ ted , Yah@@ we@@ h has not done all this . ' "
for their v@@ ine is of the v@@ ine of So@@ dom , of the fields of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h . their grap@@ es are grap@@ es of g@@ all , The@@ ir clu@@ sters are bitter .
ven@@ ge@@ ance is mine , and re@@ compen@@ se , at the time when their fo@@ ot sli@@ des ; for the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity is at hand . the things that are to come on them shall make has@@ te . "
if I wh@@ et my g@@ lit@@ tering s@@ word , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to my ad@@ vers@@ aries , and will re@@ compen@@ se those who h@@ ate me .
I will make my ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood . my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h with the blood of the sla@@ in and the cap@@ tives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
re@@ jo@@ ice , you nations , with his people , for he will av@@ en@@ ge the blood of his servants . he will ren@@ der ven@@ ge@@ ance to his ad@@ vers@@ aries , An@@ d will make exp@@ iation for his land , for his people .
for it is no v@@ ain thing for you ; because it is your life , and through this thing you shall prol@@ ong your days in the land , where you go over the Jordan to poss@@ ess it . "
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount H@@ or , and was gathered to his people :
because you t@@ res@@ passed against me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah of K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
this is the b@@ les@@ sing , with which Mos@@ es the man of God b@@ les@@ sed the children of Israel before his death .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , for they shall draw out the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the s@@ and . "
Mos@@ es went up from the pla@@ ins of Mo@@ a@@ b to Mount N@@ eb@@ o , to the top of P@@ is@@ ga@@ h , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . Yah@@ we@@ h showed him all the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to Dan ,
now it happened after the death of Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h , that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua the son of nun , Mos@@ es ' ser@@ vant , saying ,
" Mos@@ es my ser@@ vant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Mos@@ es , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor for@@ sake you .
it happened about the time of the sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don '@@ t know . pursue them quickly ; for you will over@@ take them . "
but she had brought them up to the ro@@ of , and hi@@ d them with the st@@ alk@@ s of fla@@ x , which she had laid in order on the ro@@ of .
the men pursu@@ ed them the way to the Jordan to the for@@ ds : and as soon as those who pursu@@ ed them had gone out , they shut the gate .
as soon as we had heard it , our hear@@ ts mel@@ ted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God in heav@@ en above , and on ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath .
then she let them down by a cor@@ d through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
but if you talk about this business of ours , then we shall be guil@@ t@@ less of your oath which you have made us to swe@@ ar . "
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursu@@ ers had returned . the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them .
then the two men returned , des@@ cen@@ ded from the mountain , passed over , and came to Jos@@ hua the son of nun ; and they told him all that had happened to them .
Jos@@ hua rose up early in the morning ; and they moved from Sh@@ it@@ tim , and came to the Jordan , he and all the children of Israel . they lo@@ d@@ ged there before they passed over .
it happened , when the people moved from their ten@@ ts to pass over the Jordan , the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant being before the people ,
it happened , when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan , that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
Jos@@ hua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the pri@@ ests who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant stood ; and they are there to this day .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h passed over , with the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and the children of G@@ ad , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Mos@@ es spoke to them .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ ilg@@ al , on the east border of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
this is the reason Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circum@@ c@@ ised ; but all the people who were born in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circum@@ c@@ ised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circum@@ c@@ ised by Jos@@ hua ; for they were un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , because they had not circum@@ c@@ ised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circum@@ c@@ ising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were he@@ aled .
it was so , that when Jos@@ hua had spoken to the people , the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns before Yah@@ we@@ h advanced , and ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h followed them .
so he caused the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to go around the city , going about it once . then they came into the camp , and lo@@ d@@ ged in the camp .
but as for you , only keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accur@@ sed , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of br@@ ass and iron , are hol@@ y to Yah@@ we@@ h . they shall come into Yah@@ we@@ h 's treas@@ ury . "
they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron into the treas@@ ury of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
the men of A@@ I struck about thirty @@@ -@@ @ six men of them , and they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even to She@@ bar@@ im , and struck them at the des@@ cent . the hear@@ ts of the people mel@@ ted , and became like water .
he brought near the family of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and he selected the family of the Zer@@ a@@ hi@@ tes . he brought near the family of the Zer@@ a@@ hi@@ tes man by man , and Z@@ ab@@ di was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was selected .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Jos@@ hua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up to A@@ I . Jos@@ hua chose thirty thousand men , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , and sent them out by night .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I have comman@@ ded you . "
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their amb@@ ush on the west of the city ; and Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them . they pursu@@ ed Jos@@ hua , and were drawn away from the city .
there was not a man left in A@@ I or Beth El who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go out after Israel . they left the city open , and pursu@@ ed Israel .
the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
when Jos@@ hua and all Israel saw that the amb@@ ush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city as@@ cen@@ ded , then they turned again , and killed the men of A@@ I .
for Jos@@ hua di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw back his hand , with which he stret@@ ched out the j@@ av@@ elin , until he had ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ I .
he wrote there on the stones a cop@@ y of the law of Mos@@ es , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
after@@ ward he read all the words of the law , the b@@ les@@ sing and the cur@@ se , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
they also res@@ or@@ ted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ ke@@ ys , and win@@ esk@@ ins , old and torn and bound up ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes who were beyond the Jordan , to S@@ ih@@ on king of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon and to O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , who was at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and has become m@@ ol@@ dy .
these win@@ esk@@ ins , which we filled , were new ; and be@@ hold , they are torn . these our gar@@ ments and our sho@@ es have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that they heard that they were their neigh@@ b@@ ors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t strike them , because the pr@@ inces of the Con@@ gre@@ gation had sworn to them by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel . all the Con@@ gre@@ gation mur@@ mu@@ red against the pr@@ inces .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wr@@ ath be on us , because of the oath which we s@@ wor@@ e to them . "
Jos@@ hua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Wh@@ y have you dec@@ e@@ ived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now therefore you are Cur@@ sed , and some of you will never fail to be bon@@ d@@ servants , both wood cut@@ ters and Dra@@ wers of water for the house of my God . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill them .
so Jos@@ hua went up from G@@ ilg@@ al , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
Yah@@ we@@ h conf@@ used them before Israel , and he killed them with a great sla@@ ughter at Gi@@ be@@ on , and ch@@ ased them by the way of the as@@ cent of Beth Hor@@ on , and struck them to Az@@ ek@@ ah and to Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah .
but don '@@ t stay . pursue your enem@@ ies , and them from the re@@ ar . D@@ on '@@ t allow them to enter into their cities ; for Yah@@ we@@ h your God has delivered them into your hand . "
it happened , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great sla@@ ughter until they were consu@@ med , and the re@@ mn@@ ant which remained of them had entered into the for@@ ti@@ fied cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
it happened , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or heard of it , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Ara@@ bah south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , in the low@@ land , and in the he@@ ights of D@@ or on the west ,
to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite in the hill country , and the H@@ iv@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
they went out , they and all their armies with them , many people , even as the s@@ and that is on the se@@ ash@@ ore in multi@@ tude , with very many hor@@ ses and char@@ i@@ ots .
Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they struck them , and ch@@ ased them to great S@@ id@@ on , and to Mis@@ rep@@ ho@@ th Ma@@ im , and to the val@@ ley of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h eas@@ tw@@ ard . they struck them until they left them none remaining .
they struck all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it with the edge of the s@@ word , ut@@ ter@@ ly destroying them . there was no one left who bre@@ ath@@ ed . he bur@@ n@@ t Haz@@ or with fire .
Jos@@ hua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them ; as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded .
for it was of Yah@@ we@@ h to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them , that they might have no fav@@ or , but that he might destroy them , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
there were none of the An@@ ak@@ im left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in G@@ ath , and in Ash@@ do@@ d , did some remain .
and the border of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an , of the re@@ mn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im , who lived at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and at E@@ dre@@ i ,
Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h and the children of Israel struck them . Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h gave it for a possession to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ adi@@ tes , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the king of D@@ or in the he@@ ight of D@@ or , one ; the king of Go@@ i@@ im in G@@ ilg@@ al , one ;
on the south ; all the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and M@@ ear@@ ah that belongs to the S@@ id@@ on@@ ians , to A@@ ph@@ ek , to the border of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ;
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba to Di@@ bon ;
and all the cities of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , who re@@ ig@@ ned in H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , to the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites : but G@@ es@@ hur and Ma@@ ac@@ ath d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Israel to this day .
only he gave no inher@@ it@@ ance to the tri@@ be of L@@ evi . the offer@@ ings of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , made by fire are his inher@@ it@@ ance , as he spoke to him .

according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , they gave him the city which he asked , even Tim@@ n@@ ath@@ ser@@ ah in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he built the city , and lived there .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
they set apart K@@ ede@@ sh in Gal@@ il@@ ee in the hill country of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , Sh@@ ec@@ hem in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) in the hill country of Ju@@ da@@ h .

all the cities of the L@@ evi@@ tes in the mid@@ st of the possession of the children of Israel were for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight cities with their subur@@ bs .
Yah@@ we@@ h gave them rest all around , according to all that he s@@ wor@@ e to their fa@@ thers . not a man of all their enem@@ ies stood before them . Yah@@ we@@ h delivered all their enem@@ ies into their hand .
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and with him ten pr@@ inces , one pr@@ ince of a fa@@ thers ' house for each of the tri@@ bes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fa@@ thers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
is the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we have not cleans@@ ed ourselves to this day , although there came a pla@@ gue on the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
that you must turn away this day from following Yah@@ we@@ h ? it will be , since you rebel today against Yah@@ we@@ h , that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel .
then the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h answ@@ ered , and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will th@@ rust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall poss@@ ess their land , as Yah@@ we@@ h your God spoke to you .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w down yo@@ ur@@ selves to them ;
" for Yah@@ we@@ h has driven great and strong nations out from before you . but as for you , no man has stood before you to this day .
Jos@@ hua gathered all the tri@@ bes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the el@@ ders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
" ' I sent Mos@@ es and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its mid@@ st : and after@@ ward I brought you out .
I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dro@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ; not with your s@@ word , nor with your bo@@ w .
Jos@@ hua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the o@@ ak that was by the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened after these things , that Jos@@ hua the son of nun , the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h , died , being one hundred and ten years old .
they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath@@ ser@@ ah , which is in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north of the mountain of G@@ a@@ ash .
Israel served Yah@@ we@@ h all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders who out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , and had known all the work of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he had worked for Israel .
it happened after the death of Jos@@ hua , the children of Israel asked of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Wh@@ o should go up for us first against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , to fight against them ? "
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h fought against Jer@@ usalem , and took it , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word , and set the city on fire .
after@@ ward the children of Ju@@ da@@ h went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the low@@ land .
Yah@@ we@@ h was with Ju@@ da@@ h ; and dro@@ ve out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the val@@ ley , because they had char@@ i@@ ots of iron .
the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Je@@ bu@@ sites who inhabited Jer@@ usalem ; but the Je@@ bu@@ sites d@@ well with the children of Benjamin in Jer@@ usalem to this day .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the man went into the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and built a city , and called its name L@@ uz , which is its name to this day .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced la@@ bor , and did not ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
Ze@@ bul@@ un di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Kit@@ ron , nor the inhabitants of Na@@ hal@@ ol ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites lived among them , and became subject to forced la@@ bor .
As@@ her di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Ac@@ co , nor the inhabitants of S@@ id@@ on , nor of Ah@@ lab , nor of A@@ ch@@ zi@@ b , nor of Hel@@ bah , nor of Ap@@ hi@@ k , nor of Re@@ ho@@ b ;
but the Ash@@ er@@ ites lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
the Am@@ ori@@ tes forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the val@@ ley ;
but the Am@@ ori@@ tes would d@@ well in Mount Her@@ es , in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prev@@ ailed , so that they became subject to forced la@@ bor .
and you shall make no C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their al@@ tar@@ s . ' but you have not list@@ ened to my voice : why have you done this ?
it happened , when the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
the people served Yah@@ we@@ h all the days of Jos@@ hua , and all the days of the el@@ ders who out@@ lived Jos@@ hua , who had seen all the great work of Yah@@ we@@ h that he had worked for Israel .
they buried him in the border of his inher@@ it@@ ance in Tim@@ n@@ ath Her@@ es , in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , on the north of the mountain of G@@ a@@ ash .
also all that generation were gathered to their fa@@ thers : and there ar@@ ose another generation after them , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know Yah@@ we@@ h , nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel .
wher@@ ever they went out , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against them for ev@@ il , as Yah@@ we@@ h had spoken , and as Yah@@ we@@ h had sworn to them : and they were very dist@@ ressed .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel ; and he said , " Bec@@ ause this nation have trans@@ g@@ ressed my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant which I comman@@ ded their fa@@ thers , and have not list@@ ened to my voice ;
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Yah@@ we@@ h to walk there@@ in , as their fa@@ thers kept it , or not . "
the children of Israel lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites :
the children of Israel did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for@@ got Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ ero@@ th .
when the children of Israel cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , Yah@@ we@@ h raised up a Sav@@ ior to the children of Israel , who sav@@ ed them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ e@@ b 's younger brother .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Yah@@ we@@ h strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
E@@ h@@ ud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the co@@ ol up@@ per room . E@@ h@@ ud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he ar@@ ose out of his seat .
and the handle also went in after the bla@@ de ; and the f@@ at closed on the bla@@ de , for he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw the s@@ word out of his body ; and it came out behind .
then E@@ h@@ ud went forth into the por@@ ch , and shut the doors of the up@@ per room on him , and locked them .
they w@@ aited until they were as@@ ha@@ med ; and be@@ hold , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open the doors of the up@@ per room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
it happened , when he had come , that he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Mo@@ a@@ b at that time about ten thousand men , every lu@@ st@@ y man , and every man of val@@ or ; and there escaped not a man .
she lived under the pal@@ m tree of De@@ bor@@ ah between Ram@@ ah and Be@@ the@@ l in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , to the river K@@ ish@@ on .
however Sis@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; for there was peace between J@@ ab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
the hand of the children of Israel prev@@ ailed more and more against J@@ ab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed J@@ ab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
" hear , you kings ! give e@@ ar , you pr@@ inces ! I , even I , will sing to Yah@@ we@@ h . I will sing praise to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
" Yah@@ we@@ h , when you went forth out of Se@@ ir , when you mar@@ ched out of the field of E@@ dom , the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , the sky also dropped . yes , the cl@@ ou@@ ds dropped water .
the mountains qu@@ aked at the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h , even S@@ ina@@ i , at the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
" in the days of Sh@@ am@@ gar the son of An@@ ath , in the days of Ja@@ el , the highways were un@@ occupied . the travel@@ ers walked through by@@ ways .
the pr@@ inces of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah . as was Is@@ sac@@ har , so was B@@ arak . they rushed into the val@@ ley at his feet . by the water@@ courses of Re@@ ub@@ en , there were great resol@@ ves of heart .
Ze@@ bul@@ un was a people that jeop@@ ar@@ diz@@ ed their lives to the deaths ; Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i also , on the high places of the field .
she put her hand to the tent pe@@ g , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer . with the ham@@ mer she struck Sis@@ era . she struck through his head . yes , she pi@@ er@@ ced and struck through his temp@@ les .
at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bo@@ wed , he fell . where he bo@@ wed , there he fell down dead .
" through the window she looked out , and cri@@ ed : Sis@@ era 's mother looked through the lat@@ tice . ' why is his char@@ i@@ ot so long in coming ? why do the whe@@ els of his char@@ i@@ ots wait ? '
" so let all your enem@@ ies per@@ ish , Yah@@ we@@ h , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest for@@ ty years .
the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel ; and because of Mi@@ dian the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and the c@@ aves , and the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds .
so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all who op@@ pressed you , and dro@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the o@@ ak which was in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ r@@ ite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ e@@ press , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and build an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h your God on the top of this stron@@ gh@@ old , in an or@@ derly way , and take the second bul@@ l , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering with the wood of the Ash@@ er@@ ah which you shall cut down . "
he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers throughout all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to As@@ her , and to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i ; and they came up to meet them .
it was so ; for he rose up early on the next day , and pressed the F@@ le@@ ece together , and wr@@ ung the dew out of the F@@ le@@ ece , a bo@@ w@@ l full of water .
the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like loc@@ ust@@ s for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore for multi@@ tude .
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them tr@@ ump@@ ets , and empty pit@@ chers , with tor@@ ches within the pit@@ chers .
when I blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , I and all who are with me , then blow the tr@@ ump@@ ets also on every side of all the camp , and sh@@ out , ' For Yah@@ we@@ h and for G@@ ide@@ on ! ' "
they each stood in his place around the camp ; and all the army ran ; and they sh@@ ou@@ ted , and put them to flight .
the men of Israel were gathered together out of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , and out of As@@ her , and out of all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and pursu@@ ed after Mi@@ dian .
G@@ ide@@ on went up by the way of those who lived in ten@@ ts on the east of N@@ ob@@ ah and Jo@@ g@@ beha@@ h , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
so Mi@@ dian was sub@@ du@@ ed before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest for@@ ty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Jo@@ ash his father , in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h of the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ ri@@ tes .
it happened , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the pro@@ stitute after the Ba@@ als , and made Ba@@ al Ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies on every side ;
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem assemb@@ led themselves together , and all the house of Mil@@ lo , and went and made A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch king , by the o@@ ak of the pil@@ lar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
" the v@@ ine said to them , ' Sho@@ uld I leave my new wine , which che@@ ers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
if you then have dealt truly and righ@@ te@@ ously with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and with his house this day , then re@@ jo@@ ice in A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and let him also re@@ jo@@ ice in you :
Jo@@ th@@ am ran away , and fled , and went to Be@@ er , and lived there , for fear of A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch his brother .
God sent an ev@@ il spirit between A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch :
the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set an amb@@ ush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they ro@@ bbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed came with his brothers , and went over to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem put their trust in him .
he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch craf@@ ti@@ ly , saying , " be@@ hold , G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed and his brothers have come to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and be@@ hold , they inc@@ ite the city against you .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Sh@@ ec@@ hem in four companies .
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were there@@ in : and he beat down the city , and so@@ wed it with salt .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the ro@@ of of the to@@ wer .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch came to the to@@ wer , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the to@@ wer to bur@@ n it with fire .
when the men of Israel saw that A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch was dead , they depar@@ ted every man to his place .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the children of Am@@ mon .
the children of Am@@ mon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Ju@@ da@@ h , and against Benjamin , and against the house of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; so that Israel was very dist@@ ressed .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to the children of Israel , " D@@ id@@ n '@@ t I save you from the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and from the Am@@ ori@@ tes , from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
then the children of Am@@ mon were gathered together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . the children of Israel assemb@@ led themselves together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
the people , the pr@@ inces of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Am@@ mon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . "
now J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te was a m@@ igh@@ ty man of val@@ or , and he was the son of a pro@@ stitute : and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad became the father of J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah .
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain fel@@ lows to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to get J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b ;
J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
I therefore have not sin@@ ned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Yah@@ we@@ h , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Am@@ mon . "
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah came to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to his house ; and be@@ hold , his daughter came out to meet him with tam@@ bour@@ ines and with dan@@ ces : and she was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may de@@ part and go down on the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my compan@@ ions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she was a vir@@ gin . it was a cust@@ om in Israel ,
there was a certain man of Zor@@ ah , of the family of the Dani@@ tes , whose name was Man@@ o@@ ah ; and his wife was bar@@ ren , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bear .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to the woman , and said to her , " Se@@ e now , you are bar@@ ren , and don '@@ t bear ; but you shall conce@@ ive , and bear a son .
God list@@ ened to the voice of Man@@ o@@ ah ; and the an@@ gel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Man@@ o@@ ah , her husband , was@@ n '@@ t with her .
the woman made has@@ te , and ran , and told her husband , and said to him , " be@@ hold , the man has appeared to me , who came to me that day . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the v@@ ine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any un@@ clean thing ; all that I comman@@ ded her let her observe . "
Man@@ o@@ ah said to the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h , " P@@ le@@ ase , let us de@@ tain you , that we may make a young go@@ at ready for you . "
so Man@@ o@@ ah took the young go@@ at with the me@@ al offering , and offered it on the rock to Yah@@ we@@ h . then the an@@ gel did a won@@ der@@ ful thing as Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
but the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t appear to Man@@ o@@ ah or to his wife any more . then Man@@ o@@ ah knew that he was the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ah of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
then went Sam@@ son down , and his father and his mother , to Tim@@ n@@ ah , and came to the v@@ ine@@ yards of Tim@@ n@@ ah : and be@@ hold , a young lion ro@@ ar@@ ed against him .
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing gra@@ in of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks and the standing gra@@ in , and also the olive gro@@ ves .
he struck them hip and th@@ igh with a great sla@@ ughter : and he went down and lived in the cle@@ ft of the rock of E@@ tam .
he found a fresh j@@ aw@@ bone of a don@@ key , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men there@@ with .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the j@@ aw@@ bone out of his hand ; and that place was called Ram@@ ath Leh@@ i .
Sam@@ son said to her , " If they bin@@ d me with seven green cor@@ ds that were never dri@@ ed , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
he said to her , " If they only bin@@ d me with new ro@@ pes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
it happened , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his sou@@ l was troubled to death .
the lor@@ ds of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to D@@ agon their go@@ d , and to re@@ jo@@ ice ; for they said , " Our go@@ d has delivered Sam@@ son our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d ; for they said , " Our go@@ d has delivered our enemy and the destro@@ yer of our country , who has sla@@ in many of us , into our hand . "
and Sam@@ son said to the boy who held him by the hand , " allow me to feel the pil@@ lars where@@ upon the house rests , that I may le@@ an on them . "
Sam@@ son took hold of the two middle pil@@ lars on which the house rested , and le@@ an@@ ed on them , the one with his right hand , and the other with his left .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
the man depar@@ ted out of the city , out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he trav@@ eled .
Mic@@ ah consec@@ rated the Lev@@ ite , and the young man became his pri@@ est , and was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
there set forth from there of the family of the Dani@@ tes , out of Zor@@ ah and out of E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol , six hundred men gir@@ t with weapons of war .
they turned aside there , and came to the house of the young man the Lev@@ ite , even to the house of Mic@@ ah , and asked him of his welfare .
the six hundred men gir@@ t with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
when these went into Mic@@ ah 's house , and f@@ et@@ ched the en@@ gra@@ ved image , the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the m@@ ol@@ ten image , the pri@@ est said to them , " What are you doing ? "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
so they sat down , ate , and d@@ rank , both of them together : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to the man , " P@@ le@@ ase be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said to his master , " P@@ le@@ ase come and let us turn aside into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it . "
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down on them near to Gi@@ be@@ ah , which belongs to Benjamin .
they turned aside there , to go in to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lo@@ dge .
be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " W@@ here are you going ? where did you come from ? "
then came the woman in the da@@ w@@ ning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lor@@ d was , until it was light .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Con@@ gre@@ gation was assemb@@ led as one man , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , with the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , to Yah@@ we@@ h at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
the chiefs of all the people , even of all the tri@@ bes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand foot@@ men who drew s@@ word .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah . ) The children of Israel said , " T@@ ell us , how did this w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess happen ? "
the Lev@@ ite , the husband of the woman who was murdered , answ@@ ered , " I came into Gi@@ be@@ ah that belongs to Benjamin , I and my conc@@ ub@@ ine , to lo@@ dge .
the men of Gi@@ be@@ ah rose against me , and surrounded the house by night . they thought to have sla@@ in me , and they forced my conc@@ ub@@ ine , and she is dead .
I took my conc@@ ub@@ ine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inher@@ it@@ ance of Israel ; for they have committed le@@ w@@ d@@ ness and Fol@@ ly in Israel .
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gi@@ be@@ ah : we will go up against it by lot ;
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gi@@ be@@ ah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gi@@ be@@ ah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes on that day twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand men .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gi@@ be@@ ah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again E@@ igh@@ teen thousand men ; all these drew the s@@ word .
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
there came over against Gi@@ be@@ ah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that ev@@ il was close on them .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they tr@@ usted the amb@@ ush@@ ers whom they had set against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the amb@@ ush@@ ers hur@@ ried , and rushed on Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and the amb@@ ush@@ ers drew themselves along , and struck all the city with the edge of the s@@ word .
now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the amb@@ ush@@ ers was that they should make a great cl@@ oud of smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the cl@@ oud began to arise up out of the city in a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them ; and be@@ hold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
the men of Israel turned , and the men of Benjamin were dis@@ may@@ ed ; for they saw that ev@@ il had come on them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its mid@@ st .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness to the rock of R@@ im@@ mon , and stayed in the rock of R@@ im@@ mon four months .
now the men of Israel had sworn in M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of R@@ im@@ mon , and proclaimed peace to them .
however we may not give them wi@@ ves of our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cur@@ sed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of those who dan@@ ced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inher@@ it@@ ance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel depar@@ ted there at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she k@@ is@@ sed them , and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
so they two went until they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . it happened , when they had come to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Na@@ om@@ i ? "
so Na@@ om@@ i returned , and R@@ ut@@ h the Mo@@ abi@@ tes@@ s , her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b : and they came to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem in the beginning of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est .
she went , and came and g@@ le@@ an@@ ed in the field after the re@@ apers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Bo@@ az , who was of the family of Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
be@@ hold , Bo@@ az came from B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , and said to the re@@ apers , " Yah@@ we@@ h be with you . " they answ@@ ered him , " Yah@@ we@@ h b@@ less you . "
then she fell on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and said to him , " Wh@@ y have I found fav@@ or in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreig@@ ner ? "
May Yah@@ we@@ h repay your work , and a full reward be given you from Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , under whose w@@ ings you have come to take ref@@ uge . "
then she said , " Let me find fav@@ or in your sight , my lor@@ d , because you have comfor@@ ted me , and because you have spoken kin@@ dly to your hand@@ ma@@ id , though I am not as one of your hand@@ ma@@ i@@ den@@ s . "
so she stayed close to the ma@@ i@@ den@@ s of Bo@@ az , to g@@ le@@ an to the end of bar@@ ley har@@ v@@ est and of wheat har@@ v@@ est ; and she lived with her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
therefore was@@ h yo@@ ur@@ self , ano@@ int yo@@ ur@@ self , get d@@ ressed , and go down to the th@@ res@@ hing floor , but don '@@ t make yo@@ ur@@ self known to the man until he has finished e@@ ating and drinking .
she went down to the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and did according to all that her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law told her .
now , my daughter , don '@@ t be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a wor@@ thy woman .
he said to the near k@@ ins@@ man , " Na@@ om@@ i , who has come back out of the country of Mo@@ a@@ b , is selling the par@@ cel of land , which was our brother Eli@@ me@@ le@@ ch 's .
when the day came that El@@ kan@@ ah sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed , he gave to Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah his wife , and to all her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , por@@ tions :
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t eat .
so H@@ ann@@ ah rose up after they had e@@ aten in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , and after they had dr@@ un@@ k . now E@@ li the pri@@ est was sitting on his seat by the do@@ or@@ post of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le .
she said , " Let your hand@@ ma@@ id find fav@@ or in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her fac@@ ial expression was@@ n '@@ t sad any more .
it happened , when the time had come , that H@@ ann@@ ah conce@@ ived , and b@@ ore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Bec@@ ause I have asked him of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
but H@@ ann@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is we@@ an@@ ed ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Yah@@ we@@ h , and stay there fore@@ ver . "
when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ ls , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of me@@ al , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him to Yah@@ we@@ h 's house in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h . the child was young .
" talk no more so exceeding pro@@ u@@ dly . D@@ on '@@ t let ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance come out of your m@@ outh , For Yah@@ we@@ h is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
those who were full have hired themselves out for bread . those who were hun@@ gry are satisfied . yes , the bar@@ ren has bor@@ ne seven . she who has many children langu@@ is@@ hes .
he will keep the feet of his hol@@ y ones , but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be put to sil@@ ence in d@@ ark@@ ness ; for no man shall prev@@ ail by strength .
and he struck it into the pan , or ket@@ tle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or po@@ t ; all that the for@@ k brought up the pri@@ est took there@@ with . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h to all the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who came there .
moreover his mother made him a little ro@@ be , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the ye@@ arly sacrifice .
now E@@ li was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
a man of God came to E@@ li , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bon@@ da@@ ge to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house ?
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
you shall see the aff@@ li@@ ction of my habi@@ tation , in all the wealth which I shall give Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in your house fore@@ ver .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on H@@ oph@@ ni and Ph@@ ine@@ has : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my ano@@ in@@ ted fore@@ ver .
it happened at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " be@@ hold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the e@@ ars of everyone who he@@ ars it shall t@@ ing@@ le .
for I have told him that I will judge his house fore@@ ver , for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity which he knew , because his sons brought a cur@@ se on themselves , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t re@@ strain them .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were afraid , for they said , " God has come into the camp . " they said , " Wo@@ e to us ! for there has not been such a thing before .
Wo@@ e to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these m@@ igh@@ ty go@@ ds ? these are the go@@ ds that struck the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans with all kinds of plagu@@ es in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought , and Israel was struck , and they fled every man to his tent : and there was a very great sla@@ ughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot@@ men .
there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h the same day , with his clo@@ th@@ es torn , and with ear@@ th on his head .
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer , neither did she regard it .
when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the next day , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h . they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the pri@@ ests of D@@ agon , nor any who come into D@@ agon 's house , tre@@ ad on the threshold of D@@ agon in Ash@@ do@@ d , to this day .
the men who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t die were struck with the t@@ um@@ ors ; and the cry of the city went up to heav@@ en .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines called for the pri@@ ests and the di@@ vin@@ ers , saying , " What shall we do with the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
" now therefore take and prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves a new c@@ art , and two milk co@@ ws , on which there has come no yok@@ e ; and tie the co@@ ws to the c@@ art , and bring their cal@@ ves home from them ;
and they put the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h on the c@@ art , and the co@@ ffer with the m@@ ice of gold and the images of their t@@ um@@ ors .
they of Beth She@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
the c@@ art came into the field of Jos@@ hua of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the c@@ art , and offered up the co@@ ws for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
these are the golden t@@ um@@ ors which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines returned for a t@@ res@@ pass offering to Yah@@ we@@ h : for Ash@@ do@@ d one , for Gaza one , for Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on one , for G@@ ath one , for E@@ kr@@ on one ;
the men of Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im came , and f@@ et@@ ched up the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and brought it into the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b in the hill , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied Ele@@ azar his son to keep the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened , from the day that the Ar@@ k stayed in Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamen@@ ted after Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " D@@ on '@@ t ce@@ ase to cry to Yah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
as Samuel was offering up the bur@@ n@@ t offering , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Yah@@ we@@ h th@@ under@@ ed with a great Th@@ under on that day on the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and conf@@ used them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and pursu@@ ed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and struck them , until they came under Beth K@@ ar .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were sub@@ du@@ ed , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
the cities which the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from E@@ kr@@ on even to G@@ ath ; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . there was peace between Israel and the Am@@ ori@@ tes .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also to you .
he will take your fields , and your v@@ ine@@ yards , and your olive gro@@ ves , even their best , and give them to his servants .
he will take the tenth of your se@@ ed , and of your v@@ ine@@ yards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your don@@ ke@@ ys , and put them to his work .
he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant who was with him , " C@@ ome , and let us return , lest my father stop car@@ ing about the don@@ ke@@ ys , and be anx@@ ious for us . "
they went up to the city . as they came within the city , be@@ hold , Samuel came out toward them , to go up to the high place .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
they ran and f@@ et@@ ched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward .
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then the mes@@ sen@@ gers came to Gi@@ be@@ ah of Sa@@ ul , and spoke these words in the e@@ ars of the people : and all the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
" when you saw that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Yah@@ we@@ h your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has set a king over you .
if you will fear Yah@@ we@@ h , and serve him , and listen to his voice , and not rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , then both you and also the king who re@@ ig@@ ns over you are followers of Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , but rebel against the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h , then will the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h be against you , as it was against your fa@@ thers .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will not for@@ sake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Yah@@ we@@ h to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Yah@@ we@@ h in ce@@ asing to pra@@ y for you : but I will instruc@@ t you in the good and the right way .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it ( for the people were dist@@ ressed ) , then the people hi@@ d themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in cover@@ ts , and in p@@ its .
now some of the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws had gone over the Jordan to the land of G@@ ad and G@@ il@@ e@@ ad ; but as for Sa@@ ul , he was yet in G@@ ilg@@ al , and all the people followed him tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might gre@@ et him .
therefore I said , ' Now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down on me to G@@ ilg@@ al , and I ha@@ ven '@@ t ent@@ re@@ ated the fav@@ or of Yah@@ we@@ h . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the bur@@ n@@ t offering . "
but now your k@@ ing@@ dom shall not continue . Yah@@ we@@ h has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yah@@ we@@ h has appointed him to be pr@@ ince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded you . "
the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , to the land of Sh@@ ual ;
the one c@@ rag rose up on the north in front of Mic@@ h@@ mas@@ h , and the other on the south in front of Ge@@ ba .
both of them revealed themselves to the gar@@ ris@@ on of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , " be@@ hold , the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws are coming out of the ho@@ les where they had hidden themselves ! "
that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a fur@@ row 's length in an ac@@ re of land .
then Sa@@ ul said to the people who were with him , " Coun@@ t now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , be@@ hold , Jon@@ athan and his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er were not there .
Sa@@ ul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow : a very great conf@@ usion .
now the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws who were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
and the people fle@@ w on the sp@@ oil , and took she@@ ep , and c@@ attle , and cal@@ ves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua ; and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az . the name of the captain of his army was Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
there was severe war against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Sa@@ ul : and when Sa@@ ul saw any m@@ igh@@ ty man , or any val@@ i@@ ant man , he took him to him .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' I have marked that which A@@ mal@@ ek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Samuel said to him , " Yah@@ we@@ h has torn the k@@ ing@@ dom of Israel from you this day , and has given it to a neigh@@ bor of yo@@ urs who is better than you .
Samuel said , " As your s@@ word has made women ch@@ ild@@ less , so your mother will be ch@@ ild@@ less among women ! " Samuel cut A@@ ga@@ g in pieces before Yah@@ we@@ h in G@@ ilg@@ al .
then Samuel took the Hor@@ n of oil , and ano@@ in@@ ted him in the mid@@ st of his brothers : and the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ram@@ ah .
Sa@@ ul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , and set the battle in array against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a val@@ ley between them .
he had a hel@@ met of br@@ ass on his head , and he was cla@@ d with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , whose name was J@@ es@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Sa@@ ul , stric@@ ken among men .
the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se had gone after Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
now Sa@@ ul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the val@@ ley of E@@ lah , fighting with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
David left his bag@@ g@@ age in the hand of the keep@@ er of the bag@@ g@@ age , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , be@@ hold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , Gol@@ i@@ ath by name , out of the ranks of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were ter@@ ri@@ fied .
when the words were heard which David spoke , they re@@ hear@@ sed them before Sa@@ ul ; and he sent for him .
Sa@@ ul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Phil@@ ist@@ ine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
Sa@@ ul d@@ ressed David with his clo@@ thing . he put a hel@@ met of br@@ ass on his head , and he cla@@ d him with a co@@ at of mail .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine looked about , and saw David , he dis@@ da@@ ined him ; for he was but a youth , and ru@@ d@@ dy , and with@@ al of a fair face .
and that all this assembly may know that Yah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t save with s@@ word and spe@@ ar : for the battle is Yah@@ we@@ h 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
it happened , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine ar@@ ose , and came and drew near to meet David , that David hur@@ ried , and ran toward the army to meet the Phil@@ ist@@ ine .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and s@@ lun@@ g it , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head ; and the stone san@@ k into his fore@@ head , and he fell on his face to the ear@@ th .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Sa@@ ul , that the sou@@ l of Jon@@ athan was k@@ n@@ it with the sou@@ l of David , and Jon@@ athan lov@@ ed him as his own sou@@ l .
Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clo@@ thing , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his s@@ ash .
when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . the days were not expired ;
I will go out and stand bes@@ ide my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Sa@@ ul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spe@@ ar ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he st@@ uck the spe@@ ar into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
when the mes@@ sen@@ gers came in , be@@ hold , the ter@@ ap@@ him was in the bed , with the pil@@ low of go@@ ats ' ha@@ ir at its head .
he went there to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah . then the Spiri@@ t of God came on him also , and he went on , and pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , until he came to N@@ ai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah .
if your father mis@@ s me at all , then say , ' David ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly asked leave of me that he might run to B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem his city ; for it is the ye@@ arly sacrifice there for all the family . '
but also you shall not cut off your kin@@ d@@ ness from my house fore@@ ver ; no , not when Yah@@ we@@ h has cut off the enem@@ ies of David everyone from the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th . "
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jon@@ athan stood up , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of J@@ es@@ se lives on the ear@@ th , you shall not be established , nor your k@@ ing@@ dom . therefore now send and bring him to me , for he shall su@@ rely die ! "
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
it happened in the morning , that Jon@@ athan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little boy with him .
when the boy had come to the place of the ar@@ row which Jon@@ athan had shot , Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the boy , and said , " Is@@ n '@@ t the ar@@ row beyond you ? "
Jon@@ athan cri@@ ed after the boy , " G@@ o fast ! hur@@ ry ! D@@ on '@@ t delay ! " Jon@@ athan 's boy gathered up the ar@@ ro@@ ws , and came to his master .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g the E@@ dom@@ ite , the best of the her@@ d@@ s@@ men who belonged to Sa@@ ul .
David ar@@ ose , and fled that day for fear of Sa@@ ul , and went to A@@ ch@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
David therefore depar@@ ted there , and escaped to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
Sa@@ ul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Benj@@ am@@ ites ! will the son of J@@ es@@ se give everyone of you fields and v@@ ine@@ yards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
then the king sent to call A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the pri@@ est , the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and all his father 's house , the pri@@ ests who were in No@@ b : and they came all of them to the king .
David and his men went to Ke@@ il@@ ah , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brought away their li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , and killed them with a great sla@@ ughter . so David sav@@ ed the inhabitants of Ke@@ il@@ ah .
it happened , when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the son of A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch fled to David to Ke@@ il@@ ah , that he came down with an ep@@ ho@@ d in his hand .
David stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness in the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds , and remained in the hill country in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h . Sa@@ ul sought him every day , but God di@@ d@@ n '@@ t deliver him into his hand .
then the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes came up to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , " Do@@ es@@ n '@@ t David hide himself with us in the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of the de@@ sert ?
they ar@@ ose , and went to Z@@ ip@@ h before Sa@@ ul : but David and his men were in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on , in the Ara@@ bah on the south of the de@@ sert .
Sa@@ ul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
it happened , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , " be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En Ge@@ di . "
so David checked his men with these words , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t allow them to rise against Sa@@ ul . Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Sa@@ ul , that Sa@@ ul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Sa@@ ul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me , because when Yah@@ we@@ h had delivered me up into your hand , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill me .
for if a man finds his enemy , will he let him go away un@@ har@@ med ? therefore may Yah@@ we@@ h reward you good for that which you have done to me this day .
swe@@ ar now therefore to me by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you will not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " G@@ o up to Car@@ mel , and go to Nab@@ al , and gre@@ et him in my name .
you shall tell him , ' L@@ ong life to you ! peace be to you , and peace be to your house , and peace be to all that you have .
when David 's young men came , they spoke to Nab@@ al according to all those words in the name of David , and ce@@ ased .
so David 's young men turned on their way , and went back , and came and told him according to all these words .
they were a wall to us both by night and by day , all the while we were with them keeping the she@@ ep .
God do so to the enem@@ ies of David , and more also , if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who ur@@ in@@ ates on a wall . "
when A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il saw David , she hur@@ ried , and al@@ igh@@ ted from her don@@ key , and fell before David on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground .
now this present which your ser@@ vant has brought to my lor@@ d , let it be given to the young men who follow my lor@@ d .
ple@@ ase for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of your hand@@ ma@@ id . for Yah@@ we@@ h will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house , because my lor@@ d fights the batt@@ les of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and ev@@ il shall not be found in you all your days .
it shall come to pass , when Yah@@ we@@ h has done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you pr@@ ince over Israel ,
b@@ les@@ sed is your discre@@ tion , and b@@ les@@ sed are you , that have kept me this day from blood guil@@ tin@@ ess , and from av@@ eng@@ ing myself with my own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " G@@ o up in peace to your house . be@@ hold , I have list@@ ened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
when the servants of David had come to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il to Car@@ mel , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she ar@@ ose , and bo@@ wed her@@ self with her face to the ear@@ th , and said , " be@@ hold , your hand@@ ma@@ id is a ser@@ vant to was@@ h the feet of the servants of my lor@@ d . "
A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il hur@@ ried , and ar@@ ose , and ro@@ de on a don@@ key , with five ladi@@ es of hers who followed her ; and she went after the mes@@ sen@@ gers of David , and became his wife .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
Sa@@ ul en@@ camp@@ ed in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before the de@@ sert , by the way . but David stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
he said , " Wh@@ y does my lor@@ d pursue after his ser@@ vant ? for what have I done ? or what ev@@ il is in my hand ?
now therefore , don '@@ t let my blood fall to the ear@@ th away from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one hun@@ ts a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains . "
be@@ hold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and let him deliver me out of all op@@ pression . "
David ar@@ ose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to A@@ ch@@ ish the son of Ma@@ o@@ ch , king of G@@ ath .
David lived with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was a full year and four months .
David struck the land , and sav@@ ed neither man nor woman alive , and took away the she@@ ep , and the c@@ attle , and the don@@ ke@@ ys , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , and the clo@@ thing ; and he returned , and came to A@@ ch@@ ish .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . Sa@@ ul had put away those who had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
when the woman saw Samuel , she cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice ; and the woman spoke to Sa@@ ul , saying , " Wh@@ y have you dec@@ e@@ ived me ? for you are Sa@@ ul ! "
Yah@@ we@@ h has done to you as he spoke by me . Yah@@ we@@ h has torn the k@@ ing@@ dom out of your hand , and given it to your neigh@@ bor , even to David .
because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t exec@@ ute his fierce wr@@ ath on A@@ mal@@ ek , therefore Yah@@ we@@ h has done this thing to you this day .
now therefore , ple@@ ase listen also to the voice of your hand@@ ma@@ id , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
the woman had a f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f in the house . she hur@@ ried and killed it ; and she took fl@@ our , and k@@ ne@@ aded it , and bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread of it .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , ' Sa@@ ul has sla@@ in his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lor@@ d who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to de@@ part in the morning , to return into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to J@@ ez@@ reel .
it happened , when David and his men had come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had made a raid on the South , and on Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and had struck Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ,
and had taken cap@@ tive the women and all who were there@@ in , both small and great . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
when David and his men came to the city , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink .
we made a raid on the South of the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and on that which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h , and on the South of Cal@@ e@@ b ; and we burned Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g with fire . "
David struck them from the tw@@ il@@ ight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who ro@@ de on ca@@ me@@ ls and fled .
when David came to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , he sent of the sp@@ oil to the el@@ ders of Ju@@ da@@ h , even to his friends , saying , " be@@ hold , a present for you of the sp@@ oil of the enem@@ ies of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
and to those who were in Hor@@ ma@@ h , and to those who were in Bor@@ ash@@ an , and to those who were in Ath@@ ach ,
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard on Sa@@ ul and on his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines killed Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua , the sons of Sa@@ ul .
it happened on the next day , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his three sons fallen on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
they cut off his head , and stri@@ pped off his arm@@ or , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to the house of their id@@ ols , and to the people .
they put his arm@@ or in the house of the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th ; and they fas@@ tened his body to the wall of Beth S@@ han .
it happened after the death of Sa@@ ul , when David was returned from the sla@@ ughter of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and David had stayed two days in Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g ;
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul was le@@ an@@ ing on his spe@@ ar ; and be@@ hold , the char@@ i@@ ots and the hor@@ se@@ men followed hard after him .
then David took hold on his clo@@ th@@ es , and t@@ ore them ; and likewise all the men who were with him .
they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until evening , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
( and he comman@@ ded them to te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the song of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ har ) :
Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan were lov@@ ely and pleas@@ ant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les . they were stronger than li@@ ons .
I am dist@@ ressed for you , my brother Jon@@ athan . you have been very pleas@@ ant to me . your love to me was won@@ der@@ ful , passing the love of women .
David brought up his men who were with him , every man with his household . they lived in the cities of He@@ br@@ on .
the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . they told David , saying , " The men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad were those who buried Sa@@ ul . "
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and said to them , " b@@ les@@ sed are you by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you have shown this kin@@ d@@ ness to your lor@@ d , even to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be val@@ i@@ ant ; for Sa@@ ul your lor@@ d is dead , and also the house of Ju@@ da@@ h have ano@@ in@@ ted me king over them . "
now Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , captain of Sa@@ ul 's army , had taken I@@ sh@@ bos@@ het@@ h the son of Sa@@ ul , and brought him over to Mah@@ an@@ aim ;
they each caught his opponent by the head , and th@@ rust his s@@ word in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Hel@@ kat@@ h Haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
the battle was very severe that day : and Ab@@ ner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
A@@ sah@@ el pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner ; and in going he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Ab@@ ner .
but Jo@@ a@@ b and Ab@@ is@@ hai pursu@@ ed after Ab@@ ner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Am@@ ma@@ h , that lies before Gi@@ ah by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Gi@@ be@@ on .
Jo@@ a@@ b said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , su@@ rely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
Ab@@ ner and his men went all that night through the Ara@@ bah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bi@@ th@@ ron , and came to Mah@@ an@@ aim .
they took up A@@ sah@@ el , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem . Jo@@ a@@ b and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at He@@ br@@ on .
now there was long war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Sa@@ ul grew we@@ aker and we@@ aker .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
and the fourth , Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ; and the fifth , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of A@@ bi@@ tal ;
it happened , while there was war between the house of Sa@@ ul and the house of David , that Ab@@ ner made himself strong in the house of Sa@@ ul .
her husband went with her , we@@ eping as he went , and followed her to Ba@@ hur@@ im . then Ab@@ ner said to him , " G@@ o ! return ! " and he returned .
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
you know Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , that he came to dec@@ e@@ ive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into f@@ et@@ ters . as a man falls before the children of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , so you fell . " all the people we@@ pt again over him .
so all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er .
the sons of R@@ im@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , Rec@@ ha@@ b and Ba@@ an@@ ah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of I@@ sh@@ bos@@ het@@ h , as he took his rest at noon .
how much more , when w@@ ic@@ ked men have sla@@ in a righ@@ te@@ ous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the ear@@ th ? "
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted David king over Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the stron@@ gh@@ old .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall stir yo@@ ur@@ self up ; for then Yah@@ we@@ h has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
they set the Ar@@ k of God on a new c@@ art , and brought it out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b that was in the hill : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hi@@ o , the sons of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , dro@@ ve the new c@@ art .
when they came to the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Nac@@ on , Uz@@ z@@ ah reached for the Ar@@ k of God , and took hold of it ; for the c@@ attle stumb@@ led .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ z@@ ah ; and God struck him there for his er@@ ror ; and there he died by the Ar@@ k of God .
so David would not move the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
it was so , that , when those who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h had gone six p@@ aces , he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed an o@@ x and a f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f .
they brought in the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before Yah@@ we@@ h .
when David had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
I will be yet more v@@ ile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the hand@@ ma@@ ids of whom you have spoken , they shall hon@@ or me . "
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
now therefore you shall tell my ser@@ vant David this , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " I took you from the she@@ ep p@@ en , from following the she@@ ep , that you should be pr@@ ince over my people , over Israel .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sle@@ ep with your fa@@ thers , I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall proceed out of your bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
but my lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from him , as I took it from Sa@@ ul , whom I put away before you .
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this gre@@ at@@ ness , to make your ser@@ vant know it .
therefore you are great , Yah@@ we@@ h God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our e@@ ars .
for you , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your ser@@ vant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your ser@@ vant has found in his heart to pra@@ y this pray@@ er to you .
after this it happened that David struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sub@@ du@@ ed them : and David took the bri@@ dle of the mother city out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to help Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David struck of the Syri@@ ans two and twenty thousand men .
and Zad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were pri@@ ests ; and Ser@@ ai@@ ah was s@@ cri@@ be ;
then the king called to Z@@ ib@@ a , Sa@@ ul 's ser@@ vant , and said to him , " All that per@@ tained to Sa@@ ul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
so Han@@ un took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved off the one half of their be@@ ards , and cut off their gar@@ ments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother ; and he put them in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
he said , " If the Syri@@ ans are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be cour@@ age@@ ous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Yah@@ we@@ h do that which seems good to him . "
so Jo@@ a@@ b and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syri@@ ans : and they fled before him .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
Had@@ ade@@ zer sent , and brought out the Syri@@ ans who were beyond the River : and they came to He@@ lam , with Sho@@ b@@ ach the captain of the army of Had@@ ade@@ zer at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to He@@ lam . the Syri@@ ans set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
it happened at evening , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked on the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman ba@@ thing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was pur@@ ified from her un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess ) ; and she returned to her house .
when U@@ ri@@ ah had come to him , David asked of him how Jo@@ a@@ b did , and how the people far@@ ed , and how the war prosp@@ ered .
David said to U@@ ri@@ ah , " G@@ o down to your house , and was@@ h your feet . " U@@ ri@@ ah depar@@ ted out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but U@@ ri@@ ah sle@@ pt at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lor@@ d , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
it happened in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Jo@@ a@@ b , and sent it by the hand of U@@ ri@@ ah .
it happened , when Jo@@ a@@ b kept watch on the city , that he assigned U@@ ri@@ ah to the place where he knew that val@@ i@@ ant men were .
it shall be that , if the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he asks you , ' Wh@@ y did you go so near to the city to fight ? D@@ id@@ n '@@ t you know that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
the sho@@ o@@ ters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your ser@@ vant U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te is dead also . "
the el@@ ders of his house ar@@ ose bes@@ ide him , to raise him up from the ear@@ th : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fas@@ ted and we@@ pt for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
but Am@@ non had a friend , whose name was Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b , the son of Shi@@ me@@ ah , David 's brother ; and Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b was a very sub@@ tle man .
she took the pan , and p@@ oured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Am@@ non said , " H@@ ave all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
Am@@ non said to Tam@@ ar , " Br@@ ing the food into the room , that I may eat from your hand . " Tam@@ ar took the cak@@ es which she had made , and brought them into the room to Am@@ non her brother .
when she had brought them near to him to eat , he took hold of her , and said to her , " C@@ ome , lie with me , my sister ! "
she had a gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors on her ; for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who were vir@@ g@@ ins d@@ ressed . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had comman@@ ded . then all the king 's sons ar@@ ose , and every man got up on his mul@@ e , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don '@@ t let my lor@@ d the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Am@@ non only is dead . "
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold , many people were coming by way of the hil@@ l@@ side behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt . the king also and all his servants we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
for the king will hear , to deliver his ser@@ vant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inher@@ it@@ ance of God .
to change the face of the matter has your ser@@ vant Jo@@ a@@ b done this thing . my lor@@ d is wise , according to the wis@@ dom of an an@@ gel of God , to know all things that are in the ear@@ th . "
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
to Ab@@ sal@@ om there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tam@@ ar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
so Jo@@ a@@ b came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bo@@ wed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king k@@ is@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
it was so , that when any man came near to do him obe@@ is@@ ance , he put forth his hand , and took hold of him , and k@@ is@@ sed him .
Ab@@ sal@@ om did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Ab@@ sal@@ om st@@ ole the hear@@ ts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of for@@ ty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said to the king , " P@@ le@@ ase let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed to Yah@@ we@@ h , in He@@ br@@ on .
two hundred men went with Ab@@ sal@@ om out of Jer@@ usalem , who were invited , and went in their simp@@ lic@@ ity ; and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know anything .
Ab@@ sal@@ om sent for A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el the G@@ il@@ on@@ ite , David 's coun@@ sel@@ or , from his city , even from G@@ il@@ o@@ h , while he was offering the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . the con@@ spir@@ acy was strong ; for the people increased continu@@ ally with Ab@@ sal@@ om .
but if he say thus , ' I have no de@@ light in you ; ' be@@ hold , here am I@@ . Let him do to me as seems good to him . "
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was wor@@ shi@@ ped , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at torn , and ear@@ th on his head .
D@@ on '@@ t you have Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az , Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan , A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that Yah@@ we@@ h will look on the wrong done to me , and that Yah@@ we@@ h will repay me good for the cur@@ sing of me today . "
so David and his men went by the way ; and Shi@@ me@@ i went along on the hil@@ l@@ side opposite him , and Cur@@ sed as he went , threw stones at him , and threw d@@ ust .
it happened , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , had come to Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " L@@ ong live the king ! long live the king ! "
again , whom should I serve ? Sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in your father 's presence , so will I be in your presence . "
so they spread Ab@@ sal@@ om a tent on the top of the house ; and Ab@@ sal@@ om went in to his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines in the sight of all Israel .
I will come on him while he is we@@ ary and exha@@ usted , and will make him afraid . all the people who are with him shall flee . I will strike the king only ;
even he who is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t ; for all Israel knows that your father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and those who are with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ro@@ pes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there is@@ n '@@ t one small stone found there . "
Ab@@ sal@@ om set A@@ masa over the army instead of Jo@@ a@@ b . now A@@ masa was the son of a man , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra the Isra@@ elite , who went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
otherwise if I had dealt fal@@ sely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yo@@ ur@@ self would have set yo@@ ur@@ self against me . "
they took Ab@@ sal@@ om , and cast him into the great p@@ it in the forest , and raised over him a very great he@@ ap of stones . then all Israel fled everyone to his tent .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the ro@@ of of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , a man running alone .
the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people ; for the people heard it said that day , " The king gri@@ ev@@ es for his son . "
he bo@@ wed the heart of all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Ret@@ ur@@ n , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Ju@@ da@@ h came to G@@ ilg@@ al , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shi@@ me@@ i the son of Ger@@ a , the Benj@@ am@@ ite , who was of Ba@@ hur@@ im , hur@@ ried and came down with the men of Ju@@ da@@ h to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Z@@ ib@@ a the ser@@ vant of the house of Sa@@ ul , and his fif@@ teen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your ser@@ vant knows that I have sin@@ ned . therefore be@@ hold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king . "
it happened , when he had come to Jer@@ usalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Wh@@ y di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you go with me , M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h ? "
now Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i was a very aged man , even eigh@@ ty years old : and he had provided the king with sust@@ en@@ ance while he lay at Mah@@ an@@ aim ; for he was a very great man .
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king k@@ is@@ sed Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , and b@@ les@@ sed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to G@@ ilg@@ al , and Ch@@ im@@ ham went over with him . all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri ; but the men of Ju@@ da@@ h joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jer@@ usalem .
so A@@ masa went to call the men of Ju@@ da@@ h together ; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men ; and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Jo@@ a@@ b , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
he went through all the tri@@ bes of Israel to A@@ bel , and to Beth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all the Ber@@ ites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then she spoke , saying , " They were used to say in old times , ' They shall su@@ rely ask coun@@ sel at A@@ bel ; ' and so they settled it .
now Jo@@ a@@ b was over all the army of Israel ; and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and over the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites ;
but the king spar@@ ed M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , the son of Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul , because of Yah@@ we@@ h 's oath that was between them , between David and Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul .
and he brought up from there the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and the b@@ ones of Jon@@ athan his son : and they gathered the b@@ ones of those who were han@@ ged .
they buried the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son in the country of Benjamin in Z@@ ela , in the tomb of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king comman@@ ded . after that God was ent@@ re@@ ated for the land .
it came to pass after this , that there was again war with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at Go@@ b : then Si@@ b@@ bec@@ ai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite killed Sap@@ h , who was of the sons of the giant .
there was again war with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at Go@@ b ; and El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are@@ o@@ regi@@ m the B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite killed Gol@@ i@@ ath the G@@ itti@@ te 's brother , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ av@@ er 's be@@ am .
David spoke to Yah@@ we@@ h the words of this song in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
God , my rock , in him I will take ref@@ uge ; my shield , and the Hor@@ n of my sal@@ vation , my high to@@ wer , and my ref@@ uge . my Sav@@ ior , you save me from violence .
I will call on Yah@@ we@@ h , who is wor@@ thy to be praised : so shall I be sav@@ ed from my enem@@ ies .
in my dist@@ ress I called on Yah@@ we@@ h . yes , I called to my God . he heard my voice out of his temp@@ le . my cry came into his e@@ ars .
then the channels of the sea appeared . the foundations of the world were laid b@@ are by the re@@ bu@@ ke of Yah@@ we@@ h , At the blast of the bre@@ ath of his nos@@ tr@@ ils .
you will save the aff@@ lic@@ ted people , But your eyes are on the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , that you may bring them down .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Yah@@ we@@ h is tested . he is a shield to all those who take ref@@ uge in him .
I have consu@@ med them , and struck them through , so that they can '@@ t arise . yes , they have fallen under my feet .
then I beat them as small as the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th . I cr@@ us@@ hed them as the m@@ ire of the streets , and spread them abroad .
you also have delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
the foreigners will submit themselves to me . as soon as they hear of me , they will obe@@ y me .
who brings me away from my enem@@ ies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righ@@ te@@ ously , who rules in the fear of God ,
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds , when the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ ings out of the ear@@ th , through clear sh@@ ining after rain . '
but all of the un@@ go@@ dly shall be as thor@@ ns to be th@@ rust away , because they can '@@ t be taken with the hand ,
these are the names of the m@@ igh@@ ty men whom David had : Jos@@ he@@ b B@@ ass@@ he@@ bet@@ h a Tah@@ chem@@ on@@ ite , chief of the cap@@ tains ; the same was Ad@@ ino the E@@ z@@ n@@ ite , against eight hundred sla@@ in at one time .
after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of len@@ ti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
W@@ as@@ n '@@ t he most hon@@ or@@ able of the three ? therefore he was made their captain : however he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t at@@ tain to the three .
and came to the stron@@ gh@@ old of T@@ y@@ re , and to all the cities of the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites ; and they went out to the south of Ju@@ da@@ h , at Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
so when they had gone back and forth through all the land , they came to Jer@@ usalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
Ara@@ un@@ ah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Ara@@ un@@ ah said to David , " Let my lor@@ d the king take and offer up what seems good to him . be@@ hold , the c@@ attle for the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the th@@ res@@ hing instruments and the yok@@ es of the ox@@ en for the wood :
now king David was old and stric@@ ken in years ; and they covered him with clo@@ th@@ es , but he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t keep warm .
then Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah the son of Hag@@ git@@ h ex@@ al@@ ted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ se@@ men , and fif@@ ty men to run before him .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men who belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
be@@ hold , while you yet talk there with the king , I also will come in after you , and confirm your words . "
otherwise it will happen , when my lor@@ d the king shall sle@@ ep with his fa@@ thers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offen@@ ders . "
they told the king , saying , " be@@ hold , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t ! " when he had come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but he has@@ n '@@ t called me , even me your ser@@ vant , and Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and your ser@@ vant Solomon .
the king said to them , " T@@ ake with you the servants of your lor@@ d , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mul@@ e , and bring him down to G@@ ih@@ on .
all the people came up after him , and the people pip@@ ed with pip@@ es , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy , so that the ear@@ th sho@@ ok with their sound .
Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah fear@@ ed because of Solomon ; and he ar@@ ose , and went , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he comman@@ ded Solomon his son , saying ,
so Solomon th@@ rust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being pri@@ est to Yah@@ we@@ h , that he might fulfill the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke concerning the house of E@@ li in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h .
the news came to Jo@@ a@@ b ; for Jo@@ a@@ b had turned after Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah , though he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn after Ab@@ sal@@ om . Jo@@ a@@ b fled to the tent of Yah@@ we@@ h , and caught hold on the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar .
then Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , know for certain that you shall su@@ rely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
the king said moreover to Shi@@ me@@ i , " You know all the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess which your heart is priv@@ y to , that you did to David my father . therefore Yah@@ we@@ h shall return your w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess on your own head .
so the king comman@@ ded Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in the hand of Solomon .
now , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , you have made your ser@@ vant king instead of David my father . I am but a little child . I don '@@ t know how to go out or come in .
your ser@@ vant is in the mid@@ st of your people which you have chosen , a great people , that can '@@ t be num@@ ber@@ ed nor counted for multi@@ tude .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
she ar@@ ose at midnight , and took my son from bes@@ ide me , while your hand@@ ma@@ id sle@@ pt , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and laid her dead child in my bos@@ om .
when I rose in the morning to nur@@ se my child , be@@ hold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , be@@ hold , it was not my son , whom I b@@ ore . "
Ba@@ ana the son of Ah@@ il@@ ud , in Ta@@ an@@ ach and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and all Beth Sh@@ ean which is bes@@ ide Z@@ are@@ than , ben@@ e@@ ath J@@ ez@@ reel , from Beth Sh@@ ean to A@@ bel Me@@ ho@@ lah , as far as beyond Jok@@ me@@ am ;
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri , in the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Solomon ruled over all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms from the River to the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and to the border of Egypt : they brought tri@@ bute , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten head of f@@ at c@@ attle , and twenty head of c@@ attle out of the pas@@ tures , and one hundred she@@ ep , besides har@@ ts , and gaz@@ el@@ les , and ro@@ e@@ bu@@ cks , and f@@ atten@@ ed fo@@ w@@ l .
for he had domin@@ ion over all on this side the River , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
for he was wis@@ er than all men ; than E@@ than the E@@ z@@ rah@@ ite , and H@@ eman , and Cal@@ col , and Dar@@ da , the sons of Ma@@ hol : and his f@@ ame was in all the nations all around .
H@@ i@@ ram king of T@@ y@@ re sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had ano@@ in@@ ted him king in the place of his father : for H@@ i@@ ram was ever a l@@ over of David .
Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of p@@ ure oil . Solomon gave this to H@@ i@@ ram year by year .
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Ad@@ on@@ i@@ ram was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who b@@ ore rule over the people who la@@ bo@@ red in the work .
the por@@ ch before the temp@@ le of the house , twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts was its length , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house . ten cu@@ bi@@ ts was its b@@ read@@ th before the house .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quar@@ ry ; and there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
he prepared an or@@ acle in the mid@@ st of the house within , to set there the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h .
within the or@@ acle was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in length , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in b@@ read@@ th , and twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts in its he@@ ight ; and he over@@ laid it with p@@ ure gold : and he covered the alt@@ ar with c@@ ed@@ ar .
the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole alt@@ ar that belonged to the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the he@@ ight of the one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , and so was it of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
and two doors of f@@ ir wood : the two leaves of the one door were fol@@ ding , and the two leaves of the other door were fol@@ ding .
he made the por@@ ch of pil@@ lars ; its length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its b@@ read@@ th thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a por@@ ch before them ; and pil@@ lars and a threshold before them .
his house where he was to d@@ well , the other court within the por@@ ch , was of the like work . he made also a house for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this por@@ ch .
there were capitals above also on the two pil@@ lars , close by the bel@@ ly which was bes@@ ide the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred , in ro@@ ws around on the other capital .
he set up the pil@@ lars at the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
he made the m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass , and its he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts en@@ circ@@ led it .
it was a hand@@ b@@ read@@ th th@@ ick : and its bri@@ m was worked like the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , like the f@@ lower of a L@@ ily : it held two thousand ba@@ ths .
the work of the bases was like this : they had pan@@ els ; and there were pan@@ els between the led@@ ges ;
and on the pan@@ els that were between the led@@ ges were li@@ ons , ox@@ en , and ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m ; and on the led@@ ges there was a pe@@ dest@@ al above ; and ben@@ e@@ ath the li@@ ons and ox@@ en were w@@ re@@ aths of han@@ ging work .
the four whe@@ els were under@@ ne@@ ath the pan@@ els ; and the ax@@ les of the whe@@ els were in the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and half a cu@@ bit .
the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ les , and their ri@@ ms , and their spok@@ es , and their nav@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
in the top of the base was there a round comp@@ ass half a cu@@ bit high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its pan@@ els were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its pan@@ els , he en@@ gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , li@@ ons , and pal@@ m trees , according to the space of each , with w@@ re@@ aths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
H@@ i@@ ram made the bas@@ ins , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins . so H@@ i@@ ram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h :
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks ; two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for each network , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the pil@@ lars ;
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins : even all these vessels , which H@@ i@@ ram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , were of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : the golden alt@@ ar , and the table where@@ upon the show bread was , of gold ;
all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month E@@ than@@ im , which is the seventh month .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , who were assemb@@ led to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the po@@ les were so long that the ends of the po@@ les were seen from the hol@@ y place before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
it came to pass , when the pri@@ ests had come out of the hol@@ y place , that the cl@@ oud filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
so that the pri@@ ests could not stand to minister by reason of the cl@@ oud ; for the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed is Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who spoke with his m@@ outh to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
" now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
but Yah@@ we@@ h said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart .
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set a place for the Ar@@ k , in which is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heav@@ en ;
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very de@@ ed d@@ well on the ear@@ th ? be@@ hold , heav@@ en and the heav@@ en of heav@@ ens can '@@ t contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and for his supp@@ lic@@ ation , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant pr@@ ays before you this day ;
listen to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your ser@@ vant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place . yes , hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place ; and when you hear , for@@ give .
" if a man sin@@ s against his neigh@@ bor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swe@@ ar , and he comes and swe@@ ar before your alt@@ ar in this house ;
then hear in heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fa@@ thers .
whatever pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation is made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall each know the pla@@ gue of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fa@@ thers .
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and of your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ) ; when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
( for they are your people , and your inher@@ it@@ ance , which you brought out of Egypt , from the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace of iron ) ;
that your eyes may be open to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your ser@@ vant , and to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your people Israel , to listen to them wh@@ en@@ ever they cry to you .
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread forth toward heav@@ en .
that he may inc@@ line our hear@@ ts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h our God , to walk in his stat@@ utes , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , as at this day . "
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of your k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel fore@@ ver , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel . '
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , ' Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the king 's house
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
H@@ i@@ ram came out from T@@ y@@ re to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ple@@ ase him .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
as for all the people who were left of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the H@@ itti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able ut@@ ter@@ ly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a lev@@ y of bon@@ d@@ servants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bon@@ d@@ servants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots and of his hor@@ se@@ men .
these were the chief officers who were over Solomon 's work , five hundred fif@@ ty , who b@@ ore rule over the people who la@@ bo@@ red in the work .
King Solomon made a nav@@ y of ships in E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber , which is bes@@ ide E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
H@@ i@@ ram sent in the nav@@ y his servants , sa@@ il@@ ors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wis@@ dom .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe the words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it . be@@ hold , the half was not told me ! your wis@@ dom and prosperity exceed the f@@ ame which I heard .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six tal@@ ents of gold ,
besides that which the tr@@ aders brought , and the traffic of the mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
there were six steps to the th@@ r@@ one , and the top of the th@@ r@@ one was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two li@@ ons standing bes@@ ide the stays .
twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
the king made silver to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ars made he to be as the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that are in the low@@ land , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
the hor@@ ses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's mer@@ chan@@ ts received them in dro@@ ves , each dro@@ ve at a price .
then Solomon built a high place for Ch@@ em@@ os@@ h the ab@@ omin@@ ation of Mo@@ a@@ b , on the mountain that is before Jer@@ usalem , and for Mo@@ le@@ ch the ab@@ omin@@ ation of the children of Am@@ mon .
however I will not tear away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but I will give one tri@@ be to your son , for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
for it happened , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ a@@ b the captain of the army was gone up to bur@@ y the sla@@ in , and had struck every male in E@@ dom
that Had@@ ad fled , he and certain E@@ dom@@ ites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Had@@ ad being yet a little child .
Had@@ ad found great fav@@ or in the sight of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es the qu@@ een .
the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es b@@ ore him Gen@@ ub@@ ath his son , whom Tah@@ pen@@ es we@@ an@@ ed in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house ; and Gen@@ ub@@ ath was in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house among the sons of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Z@@ ob@@ ah : and they went to Dam@@ as@@ cus , and lived there@@ in , and re@@ ig@@ ned in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite of Zer@@ ed@@ ah , a ser@@ vant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zer@@ u@@ ah , a wi@@ dow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Mil@@ lo , and rep@@ aired the breach of the city of David his father .
it happened at that time , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field .
A@@ hij@@ ah laid hold of the new gar@@ ment that was on him , and t@@ ore it in twelve pieces .
( but he shall have one tri@@ be , for my ser@@ vant David 's sake and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tri@@ bes of Israel ) ;
but I will take the k@@ ing@@ dom out of his son 's hand , and will give it to you , even ten tri@@ bes .
to his son will I give one tri@@ be , that David my ser@@ vant may have a lam@@ p always before me in Jer@@ usalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
I will take you , and you shall reign according to all that your sou@@ l desi@@ res , and shall be king over Israel .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am ; but Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am ar@@ ose , and fled into Egypt , to S@@ his@@ hak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am lived in Egypt ,
and they sent and called him ) , that Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all the assembly of Israel came , and spoke to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , saying ,
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took coun@@ sel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What coun@@ sel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and all Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
" speak to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to all the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , and to the rest of the people , saying ,
be@@ hold , there came a man of God out of Ju@@ da@@ h by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h to Beth El : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am was standing by the alt@@ ar to bur@@ n incen@@ se .
the man of God said to the king , " E@@ ven if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it comman@@ ded me by the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to the pro@@ phe@@ t who brought him back ;
it happened , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led the don@@ key for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the don@@ key stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t lived .
the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the don@@ key , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old pro@@ phe@@ t to mour@@ n , and to bur@@ y him .
this thing became sin to the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
take with you ten lo@@ aves , and cak@@ es , and a j@@ ar of hon@@ ey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
he who dies of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . " '
he will give Israel up because of the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , which he has sin@@ ned , and with which he has made Israel to sin . "
Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am 's wife ar@@ ose , and depar@@ ted , and came to Tir@@ z@@ ah . as she came to the threshold of the house , the child died .
the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
Ju@@ da@@ h did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king went into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the guard b@@ ore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
he walked in all the sin@@ s of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Yah@@ we@@ h his God , as the heart of David his father .
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from anything that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
he brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben Had@@ ad list@@ ened to king A@@ SA , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel Beth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i .
it happened , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard of it , that he left off building Ram@@ ah , and lived in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
for the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provoc@@ ation with which he provoked Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
be@@ hold , I will ut@@ ter@@ ly swe@@ ep away Ba@@ as@@ ha and his house ; and I will make your house like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at .
the do@@ gs will eat Ba@@ as@@ ha 's des@@ cen@@ d@@ ants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
now the rest of the acts of Ba@@ as@@ ha , and what he did , and his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
his ser@@ vant Z@@ im@@ ri , captain of half his char@@ i@@ ots , consp@@ ired against him . now he was in Tir@@ z@@ ah , drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the house of Ar@@ za , who was over the household in Tir@@ z@@ ah :
now the rest of the acts of E@@ lah , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
for his sin@@ s which he sin@@ ned in doing that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , in walk@@ ing in the way of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Z@@ im@@ ri , and his tre@@ ason that he committed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath , to make him king ; and half followed Om@@ ri .
now the rest of the acts of Om@@ ri which he did , and his might that he showed , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
A@@ ha@@ b made the Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and A@@ ha@@ b did yet more to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
so he went and did according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for he went and lived by the Bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before the Jordan .
the ra@@ ven@@ s brought him bread and f@@ les@@ h in the morning , and bread and f@@ les@@ h in the evening ; and he d@@ rank of the Bro@@ ok .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' The j@@ ar of me@@ al shall not empty , neither shall the j@@ ar of oil fail , until the day that Yah@@ we@@ h sends rain on the ear@@ th . ' "
she went and did according to the saying of Eli@@ j@@ ah : and she , and he , and her house , ate many days .
the j@@ ar of me@@ al di@@ d@@ n '@@ t empty , neither did the j@@ ar of oil fail , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by Eli@@ j@@ ah .
Yah@@ we@@ h list@@ ened to the voice of Eli@@ j@@ ah ; and the sou@@ l of the child came into him again , and he revi@@ ved .
Eli@@ j@@ ah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah said , " be@@ hold , your son lives . "
it happened after many days , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Eli@@ j@@ ah , in the third year , saying , " G@@ o , show yo@@ ur@@ self to A@@ ha@@ b ; and I will send rain on the ear@@ th . "
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Yah@@ we@@ h , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took one hundred pro@@ ph@@ ets , and hi@@ d them by fif@@ ty in a cave , and f@@ ed them with bread and water . )
it was so , when mid@@ day was past , that they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Eli@@ j@@ ah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tri@@ bes of the sons of Jac@@ o@@ b , to whom the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came , saying , " Israel shall be your name . "
then the fire of Yah@@ we@@ h fell , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the d@@ ust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the tren@@ ch .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Yah@@ we@@ h , he is God ! Yah@@ we@@ h , he is God ! "
Eli@@ j@@ ah said to them , " se@@ ize the pro@@ ph@@ ets of Ba@@ al ! D@@ on '@@ t let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Eli@@ j@@ ah brought them down to the Bro@@ ok K@@ ish@@ on , and killed them there .
so A@@ ha@@ b went up to eat and to drink . Eli@@ j@@ ah went up to the top of Car@@ mel ; and he bo@@ wed himself down on the ear@@ th , and put his face between his k@@ ne@@ es .
he looked , and be@@ hold , there was at his head a c@@ ake bak@@ ed on the co@@ als , and a j@@ ar of water . he ate and d@@ rank , and lay down again .
it shall happen , that he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of Haz@@ a@@ el , J@@ eh@@ u will kill ; and he who escap@@ es from the s@@ word of J@@ eh@@ u , E@@ lis@@ ha will kill .
yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel , all the k@@ ne@@ es which have not bo@@ wed to Ba@@ al , and every m@@ outh which has not k@@ is@@ sed him . "
the mes@@ sen@@ gers came again , and said , " Ben Had@@ ad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wi@@ ves , and your children ;
then he mu@@ ster@@ ed the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ two . after them , he mu@@ ster@@ ed all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
they went out at noon . but Ben Had@@ ad was drinking himself dr@@ un@@ k in the pav@@ ili@@ ons , he and the kings , the thirty @@@ -@@ @ two kings who helped him .
the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces went out first ; and Ben Had@@ ad sent out , and they told him , saying , " Men are coming out from Samar@@ ia . "
so these went out of the city , the young men of the pr@@ inces of the provinces , and the army which followed them .
do this thing : take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put cap@@ tains in their place .
it happened at the return of the year , that Ben Had@@ ad mu@@ ster@@ ed the Syri@@ ans , and went up to A@@ ph@@ ek , to fight against Israel .
as your ser@@ vant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " S@@ o your judgment shall be ; you yo@@ ur@@ self have decided it . "
the men of his city , even the el@@ ders and the no@@ bles who lived in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when A@@ ha@@ b heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ ha@@ b rose up to go down to the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , who d@@ wel@@ ls in Samar@@ ia . be@@ hold , he is in the v@@ ine@@ yard of Nab@@ o@@ th , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
the do@@ gs will eat he who dies of A@@ ha@@ b in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah came near , and struck Mic@@ ai@@ ah on the che@@ ek , and said , " Wh@@ ich way did the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h go from me to speak to you ? "
say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and fe@@ ed him with bread of aff@@ li@@ ction and with water of aff@@ li@@ ction , until I come in peace . " ' "
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
a cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun , saying , " Every man to his city , and every man to his country ! "
they was@@ hed the char@@ i@@ ot by the pool of Samar@@ ia ; and the do@@ gs lic@@ ked up his blood where the pro@@ stitu@@ tes was@@ hed themselves ; according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which he spoke .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and his might that he showed , and how he war@@ red , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
be@@ hold , fire came down from the sky , and consu@@ med the two former cap@@ tains of fif@@ ty with their fif@@ ties . but now let my life be pre@@ ci@@ ous in your sight . "
so he died according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which Eli@@ j@@ ah had spoken . J@@ eh@@ or@@ am began to reign in his place in the second year of J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
Eli@@ j@@ ah took his man@@ tle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on d@@ ry ground .
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that be@@ hold , a char@@ i@@ ot of fire and hor@@ ses of fire separated them ; and Eli@@ j@@ ah went up by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind into heav@@ en .
he took up also the man@@ tle of Eli@@ j@@ ah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
when the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Eli@@ j@@ ah rests on E@@ lis@@ ha . " they came to meet him , and bo@@ wed themselves to the ground before him .
he looked behind him and saw them , and Cur@@ sed them in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h . two female be@@ ars came out of the wo@@ ods , and ma@@ uled for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two of those you@@ ths .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pil@@ lar of Ba@@ al that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from it .
now Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ a@@ b was a she@@ ep bre@@ eder ; and he ren@@ dered to the king of Israel the wo@@ ol of one hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and of one hundred thousand r@@ ams .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that val@@ ley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and your animals .
now when all the Mo@@ abi@@ tes heard that the kings had come up to fight against them , they gathered themselves together , all who were able to put on arm@@ or , and up@@ ward , and stood on the border .
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun sh@@ one on the water , and the Mo@@ abi@@ tes saw the water over against them as red as blood .
when they came to the camp of Israel , the Isra@@ eli@@ tes rose up and struck the Mo@@ abi@@ tes , so that they fled before them ; and they went forward into the land s@@ mit@@ ing the Mo@@ abi@@ tes .
when the king of Mo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew s@@ word , to break through to the king of E@@ dom ; but they could not .
you shall go in , and shut the door on you and on your sons , and p@@ our out into all those contain@@ ers ; and you shall set aside that which is full . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the contain@@ ers to her , and she p@@ oured out .
then she s@@ add@@ led a don@@ key , and said to her ser@@ vant , " D@@ ri@@ ve , and go forward ! D@@ on '@@ t slow down for me , unless I ask you to . "
when E@@ lis@@ ha had come into the house , be@@ hold , the child was dead , and laid on his bed .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stret@@ ched himself on him . then the child s@@ ne@@ ez@@ ed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
the Syri@@ ans had gone out in bands , and had brought away cap@@ tive out of the land of Israel a little ma@@ iden ; and she w@@ aited on Na@@ aman 's wife .
someone went in , and told his lor@@ d , saying , " The ma@@ iden who is from the land of Israel said this . "
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , be@@ hold , I have sent Na@@ aman my ser@@ vant to you , that you may he@@ al him of his le@@ pro@@ sy . "
A@@ ren '@@ t A@@ ban@@ ah and P@@ har@@ p@@ ar , the rivers of Dam@@ as@@ cus , better than all the waters of Israel ? Co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I was@@ h in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a ra@@ ge .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his f@@ les@@ h was restored like the f@@ les@@ h of a little child , and he was clean .
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they depar@@ ted .
ple@@ ase let us go to the Jordan , and every man take a be@@ am from there , and let us make us a place there , where we may d@@ well . " he answ@@ ered , " G@@ o ! "
but as one was fel@@ ling a be@@ am , the ax@@ e head fell into the water . then he cri@@ ed , and said , " A@@ las , my master ! for it was borro@@ wed . "
now the king of Syria was war@@ ring against Israel ; and he took coun@@ sel with his servants , saying , " My camp will be in such and such a place . "
there was a great fam@@ ine in Samar@@ ia . be@@ hold , they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it , until a don@@ key 's head was sold for eigh@@ ty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a ka@@ b of do@@ ve 's D@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
they rose up in the tw@@ il@@ ight , to go to the camp of the Syri@@ ans . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syri@@ ans , be@@ hold , there was no man there .
therefore they ar@@ ose and fled in the tw@@ il@@ ight , and left their ten@@ ts , and their hor@@ ses , and their don@@ ke@@ ys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and be@@ hold , all the way was full of gar@@ ments and vessels , which the Syri@@ ans had cast away in their has@@ te . the mes@@ sen@@ gers returned , and told the king .
the woman ar@@ ose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
in the fifth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ ha@@ b king of Israel , J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at being king of Ju@@ da@@ h then , J@@ eh@@ or@@ am the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife . he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
then Jor@@ am passed over to Z@@ air , and all his char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , and the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots ; and the people fled to their ten@@ ts .
the rest of the acts of Jor@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned one year in Jer@@ usalem . his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
E@@ lis@@ ha the pro@@ phe@@ t called one of the sons of the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and said to him , " P@@ ut your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , take this vi@@ al of oil in your hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
when you come there , find J@@ eh@@ u the son of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an in@@ ner room .
you shall strike the house of A@@ ha@@ b your master , that I may av@@ en@@ ge the blood of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the blood of all the servants of Yah@@ we@@ h , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
for the whole house of A@@ ha@@ b shall per@@ ish . I will cut off from A@@ ha@@ b everyone who ur@@ in@@ ates against a wall , both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel .
I will make the house of A@@ ha@@ b like the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , and like the house of Ba@@ as@@ ha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah .
J@@ eh@@ u drew his bo@@ w with his full strength , and struck Jor@@ am between his arms ; and the ar@@ row went out at his heart , and he sun@@ k down in his char@@ i@@ ot .
he said , " throw her down ! " so they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led on the wall , and on the hor@@ ses . then he tr@@ amp@@ led her under fo@@ ot .
they went to bur@@ y her ; but they found no more of her than the s@@ kul@@ l , and the feet , and the pal@@ ms of her hands .
and the body of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel shall be as D@@ ung on the face of the field in the portion of J@@ ez@@ reel , so that they shall not say , " This is J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel . " ' "
now A@@ ha@@ b had sev@@ enty sons in Samar@@ ia . J@@ eh@@ u wrote letters , and sent to Samar@@ ia , to the rul@@ ers of J@@ ez@@ reel , even the el@@ ders , and to those who brought up the sons of A@@ ha@@ b , saying ,
" now as soon as this letter comes to you , since your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you char@@ i@@ ots and hor@@ ses , a for@@ ti@@ fied city also , and arm@@ or .
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even sev@@ enty persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent them to him to J@@ ez@@ reel .
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righ@@ te@@ ous . be@@ hold , I consp@@ ired against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the ear@@ th of the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which Yah@@ we@@ h spoke concerning the house of A@@ ha@@ b . for Yah@@ we@@ h has done that which he spoke by his ser@@ vant Eli@@ j@@ ah . "
so J@@ eh@@ u struck all that remained of the house of A@@ ha@@ b in J@@ ez@@ reel , with all his great men , his familiar friends , and his pri@@ ests , until he left him none remaining .
when he came to Samar@@ ia , he struck all who remained to A@@ ha@@ b in Samar@@ ia , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke to Eli@@ j@@ ah .
however from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin , J@@ eh@@ u di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from after them , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
now the rest of the acts of J@@ eh@@ u , and all that he did , and all his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he comman@@ ded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , shall be ke@@ epers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate S@@ ur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , shall keep the watch of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h around the king .
you shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he who comes within the ranks , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he goes out , and when he comes in . "
the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains over hundreds the spe@@ ars and shi@@ elds that had been king David 's , which were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
so they made way for her ; and she went by the way of the hor@@ ses ' entry to the king 's house . she was sla@@ in there .
so all the people of the land re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and the city was quiet . Ath@@ ali@@ ah they had sla@@ in with the s@@ word at the king 's house .
let the pri@@ ests take it to them , every man from his acqu@@ ain@@ tance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wher@@ ever any breach shall be found . "
but it was so , that in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of king Je@@ ho@@ ash the pri@@ ests had not rep@@ aired the breaches of the house .
but there were not made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h c@@ ups of silver , sn@@ u@@ ffers , bas@@ ins , tr@@ ump@@ ets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
moreover they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully .
the money for the t@@ res@@ pass offer@@ ings , and the money for the sin offer@@ ings , was not brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : it was the pri@@ ests ' .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
his servants ar@@ ose , and made a con@@ spir@@ acy , and struck Jo@@ ash at the house of Mil@@ lo , on the way that goes down to Sil@@ la .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and followed the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from it .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ a@@ el king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben@@ h@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ a@@ el , continu@@ ally .
nevertheless they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of the house of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked there@@ in : and there remained the Ash@@ er@@ ah also in Samar@@ ia . )
for he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz of the people any more than fif@@ ty hor@@ se@@ men , and ten char@@ i@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the d@@ ust in th@@ res@@ hing .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , and all that he did , and his might , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?
he said to the king of Israel , " P@@ ut your hand on the bo@@ w " ; and he put his hand on it . E@@ lis@@ ha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
E@@ lis@@ ha died , and they buried him . now the bands of the Mo@@ abi@@ tes inv@@ aded the land at the coming in of the year .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ add@@ in of Jer@@ usalem .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Jo@@ ash his father had done .
it happened , as soon as the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had sla@@ in the king his father :
but A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah would not listen . so Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h looked one another in the face at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the host@@ ages also , and returned to Samar@@ ia .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem ; and he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish : but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and killed him there .
all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , who was six@@ teen years old , and made him king in the place of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Yah@@ we@@ h saw the aff@@ li@@ ction of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any hel@@ per for Israel .
Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t say that he would blo@@ t out the name of Israel from under the sky ; but he sav@@ ed them by the hand of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash .
six@@ teen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ ec@@ ol@@ i@@ ah of Jer@@ usalem .

now the rest of the acts of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of Yah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to J@@ eh@@ u , saying , " Y@@ our sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Men@@ a@@ hem the son of Gad@@ i went up from Tir@@ z@@ ah , and came to Samar@@ ia , and struck S@@ hal@@ lum the son of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h in Samar@@ ia , and killed him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .

he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , with which he made Israel to sin .
Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a con@@ spir@@ acy against Pek@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and struck him , and killed him , and re@@ ig@@ ned in his place , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of Pek@@ ah , and all that he did , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Jer@@ us@@ ha the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h ; he did according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel .
then Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria and Pek@@ ah son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah king of Israel came up to Jer@@ usalem to war : and they bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed A@@ haz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Re@@ z@@ in king of Syria recovered E@@ la@@ th to Syria , and dro@@ ve the Jews from E@@ la@@ th ; and the Syri@@ ans came to E@@ la@@ th , and lived there , to this day .
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est built an alt@@ ar : according to all that king A@@ haz had sent from Dam@@ as@@ cus , so U@@ ri@@ j@@ ah the pri@@ est made it for the coming of king A@@ haz from Dam@@ as@@ cus .
when the king had come from Dam@@ as@@ cus , the king saw the alt@@ ar : and the king drew near to the alt@@ ar , and offered on it .
he bur@@ n@@ t his bur@@ n@@ t offering and his me@@ al offering , and p@@ oured his drink offering , and sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood of his peace offer@@ ings , on the alt@@ ar .
the bronze alt@@ ar , which was before Yah@@ we@@ h , he brought from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between his alt@@ ar and the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and put it on the north side of his alt@@ ar .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ haz which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a took Samar@@ ia , and carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and placed them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and had fear@@ ed other go@@ ds ,
and walked in the stat@@ utes of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secre@@ tly things that were not right against Yah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the for@@ ti@@ fied city ;
and there they bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in all the high places , as did the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h carried away before them ; and they worked w@@ ic@@ ked things to prov@@ oke Yah@@ we@@ h to an@@ ger ;
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , they would not listen , but har@@ dened their nec@@ k , like the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe in Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
they for@@ so@@ ok all the comman@@ d@@ ments of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , and made them m@@ ol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , and wor@@ shi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served Ba@@ al .
therefore Yah@@ we@@ h was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h only .
Yah@@ we@@ h rejected all the se@@ ed of Israel , and aff@@ lic@@ ted them , and delivered them into the hand of sp@@ o@@ ilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he t@@ ore Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at king : and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am dro@@ ve Israel from following Yah@@ we@@ h , and made them sin a great sin .
the children of Israel walked in all the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he did ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t de@@ part from them ;
until Yah@@ we@@ h removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a to this day .
so one of the pri@@ ests whom they had carried away from Samar@@ ia came and lived in Be@@ the@@ l , and ta@@ ught them how they should fear Yah@@ we@@ h .
however every nation made go@@ ds of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samar@@ it@@ ans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
so they fear@@ ed Yah@@ we@@ h , and made to them from among themselves pri@@ ests of the high places , who sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for them in the houses of the high places .
with whom Yah@@ we@@ h had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , and comman@@ ded them , saying , " You shall not fear other go@@ ds , nor bo@@ w yo@@ ur@@ selves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
now it happened in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Ju@@ da@@ h began to reign .
he tr@@ usted in Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des ,
because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , but trans@@ g@@ ressed his C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , even all that Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded , and would not hear it , nor do it .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time , H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order .
you say ( but they are but v@@ ain words ) , ' There is coun@@ sel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have rebel@@ led against me ?
now therefore , ple@@ ase give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
thus says the king , ' D@@ on '@@ t let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah dec@@ e@@ ive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
has any of the go@@ ds of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
where are the go@@ ds of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ p@@ ad ? where are the go@@ ds of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , of H@@ ena , and Iv@@ v@@ ah ? have they delivered Samar@@ ia out of my hand ?
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , came with She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es torn , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
it happened , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land . " ' "
when he heard it said of Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , " be@@ hold , he has come out to fight against you , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers again to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
'@@ Th@@ us you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , Jer@@ usalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them , which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den that were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
where is the king of Ham@@ ath , and the king of Ar@@ p@@ ad , and the king of the city of Sep@@ har@@ v@@ aim , of H@@ ena , and Iv@@ v@@ ah ? " ' "
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers , and read it . then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and spread it before Yah@@ we@@ h .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you de@@ fied and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? against whom have you ex@@ al@@ ted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yo@@ urs to lay waste for@@ ti@@ fied cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
" therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , ' He shall not come to this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mo@@ und against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened that night , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out , and struck one hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , before I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying ,
I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Yah@@ we@@ h , that Yah@@ we@@ h will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
at that time Ber@@ od@@ ach Bal@@ adan the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah ; for he had heard that H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had been si@@ ck .

Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Hep@@ h@@ zi@@ bah .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
I will cast off the re@@ mn@@ ant of my inher@@ it@@ ance , and deliver them into the hand of their enem@@ ies . they will become a pre@@ y and a sp@@ oil to all their enem@@ ies ;
because they have done that which is ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and was buried in the gar@@ den of his own house , in the gar@@ den of Uz@@ za : and Am@@ on his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
Am@@ on was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
and he for@@ so@@ ok Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fa@@ thers , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t walk in the way of Yah@@ we@@ h .
but the people of the land killed all those who had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his place .
now the rest of the acts of Am@@ on which he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?

he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in all the way of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,

however there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand ; for they dealt fa@@ ith@@ fully . "
H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . " H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es .
the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and A@@ ch@@ bor the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the king 's ser@@ vant , saying ,
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h has read .
he killed all the pri@@ ests of the high places that were there , on the al@@ tar@@ s , and burned men 's b@@ ones on them ; and he returned to Jer@@ usalem .
su@@ rely there was not kept such a P@@ ass@@ over from the days of the judges who jud@@ ged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , with which his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .

on the ninth day of the fourth month the fam@@ ine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took him in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
he bur@@ n@@ t the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , even every great house , bur@@ n@@ t he with fire .
all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down the walls around Jer@@ usalem .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the captain of the guard took away the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
the two pil@@ lars , the one sea , and the bases , which Solomon had made for the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the br@@ ass of all these vessels was without weight .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck them , and put them to death at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his land .
all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the forces , ar@@ ose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .

of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ass@@ hub , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of Has@@ habi@@ ah , of the sons of Mer@@ ari ;
so they and their children had the over@@ sight of the gates of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , even the house of the tent , by wards .
some of them also were appointed over the furniture , and over all the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and over the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .
Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , one of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who was the fir@@ st@@ born of S@@ hal@@ lum the Kor@@ ah@@ ite , had the office of trust over the things that were bak@@ ed in p@@ ans .
some of their brothers , of the sons of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , were over the show bread , to prepare it every Sab@@ b@@ ath .
these are the singers , heads of fa@@ thers ' households of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
N@@ er became the father of K@@ ish ; and K@@ ish became the father of Sa@@ ul ; and Sa@@ ul became the father of Jon@@ athan , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and E@@ sh@@ ba@@ al .
A@@ haz became the father of Jar@@ ah ; and Jar@@ ah became the father of Ale@@ me@@ th , and Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Z@@ im@@ ri ; and Z@@ im@@ ri became the father of Mo@@ za ;
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard after Sa@@ ul and after his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines killed Jon@@ athan , and A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua , the sons of Sa@@ ul .
when all the men of Israel who were in the val@@ ley saw that they fled , and that Sa@@ ul and his sons were dead , they for@@ so@@ ok their cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to stri@@ p the sla@@ in , that they found Sa@@ ul and his sons fallen on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a .
they stri@@ pped him , and took his head , and his arm@@ or , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to their id@@ ols , and to the people .
David and all Israel went to Jer@@ usalem ( the same is Je@@ bus ) ; and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , the inhabitants of the land , were there .
he was with David at Pas@@ dam@@ m@@ im , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of bar@@ ley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more hon@@ or@@ able than the two , and was made their captain : however he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t at@@ tain to the three .
they were armed with bo@@ ws , and could use both the right hand and the left in s@@ l@@ inging stones and in shooting ar@@ ro@@ ws from the bo@@ w : they were of Sa@@ ul 's brothers of Benjamin .
the chief was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er ; then Jo@@ ash , the sons of Sh@@ em@@ a@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ ath@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ i@@ el , and P@@ ele@@ t , the sons of Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Ber@@ ac@@ ah , and J@@ eh@@ u the An@@ ath@@ o@@ th@@ ite ,
these of the sons of G@@ ad were cap@@ tains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flow@@ ed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
of the children of Simeon , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
and Zad@@ ok , a young man m@@ igh@@ ty of val@@ or , and of his father 's house twenty @@@ -@@ @ two cap@@ tains .
of the children of Benjamin , the brothers of Sa@@ ul , three thousand : for hi@@ ther@@ to the greatest part of them had kept their alle@@ gi@@ ance to the house of Sa@@ ul .
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im twenty thousand eight hundred , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , famous men in their fa@@ thers ' houses .
of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their comman@@ d@@ ment .
of the Dani@@ tes who could set the battle in array , twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight thousand six hundred .
of As@@ her , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , for@@ ty thousand .
all the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
they carried the Ar@@ k of God on a new c@@ art , and brought it out of the house of A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b : and Uz@@ za and A@@ hi@@ o dro@@ ve the c@@ art .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Uz@@ za , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the Ar@@ k ; and there he died before God .
so David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t move the Ar@@ k to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
David inqu@@ ired again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
for because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t carry it at first , Yah@@ we@@ h our God made broke out against us , because we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek him according to the ordin@@ ance . "
the children of the L@@ evi@@ tes b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of God on their sho@@ ul@@ ders with the po@@ les there@@ on , as Mos@@ es comman@@ ded according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h .
David spoke to the chief of the L@@ evi@@ tes to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and har@@ ps and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als , so@@ unding al@@ oud and lifting up the voice with joy .
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his brothers , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their brothers , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;
so the singers , H@@ eman , A@@ sap@@ h , and E@@ than , were given cy@@ m@@ b@@ als of br@@ ass to sound al@@ oud ;
and Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , and Eli@@ phe@@ leh@@ u , and Mik@@ ne@@ i@@ ah , and Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and Je@@ i@@ el , and Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah , with har@@ ps tun@@ ed to the eight @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ing@@ ed Ly@@ re , to lead .
so David , and the el@@ ders of Israel , and the cap@@ tains over thousands , went to bring up the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h out of the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom with joy .
they brought in the Ar@@ k of God , and set it in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it : and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before God .
when David had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the peace offer@@ ings , he b@@ les@@ sed the people in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a portion of meat , and a c@@ ake of ra@@ is@@ ins .
so he left there , before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , A@@ sap@@ h and his brothers , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required ;
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h on the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he comman@@ ded to Israel ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yah@@ we@@ h , because his lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness en@@ du@@ res fore@@ ver ;
and with them H@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un with tr@@ ump@@ ets and cy@@ m@@ b@@ als for those that should sound al@@ oud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ th@@ un to be at the gate .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
" now therefore , you shall tell my ser@@ vant David , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , " I took you from the she@@ ep p@@ en , from following the she@@ ep , that you should be pr@@ ince over my people Israel .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you have gone , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fa@@ thers , that I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
Yah@@ we@@ h , for your ser@@ vant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this gre@@ at@@ ness , to make known all these great things .
when the Syri@@ ans of Dam@@ as@@ cus came to help Had@@ ade@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah , David struck of the Syri@@ ans twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand men .
and Zad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ itu@@ b , and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were pri@@ ests ; and S@@ hav@@ s@@ ha was s@@ cri@@ be ;
so they hired for themselves thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand char@@ i@@ ots , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah and his people , who came and en@@ camp@@ ed before M@@ ede@@ ba . the children of Am@@ mon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans .
the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Am@@ mon .
be cour@@ age@@ ous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God . May Yah@@ we@@ h do that which seems good to him . "
so Jo@@ a@@ b and the people who were with him drew near before the Syri@@ ans to the battle ; and they fled before him .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b came to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened after this , that there ar@@ ose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : then Si@@ b@@ bec@@ ai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite killed S@@ ip@@ p@@ ai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were sub@@ du@@ ed .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew s@@ word : and in Ju@@ da@@ h were four hundred sev@@ enty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
David said to God , " I have sin@@ ned greatly , in that I have done this thing . but now , put away , I be@@ g you , the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of your ser@@ vant ; for I have done very fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ ly . "
then the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded G@@ ad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
David built an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h there , and offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings , and called on Yah@@ we@@ h ; and he answ@@ ered him from the sky by fire on the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering .
for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h , which Mos@@ es made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering , were at that time in the high place at Gi@@ be@@ on .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set mas@@ ons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in ab@@ und@@ ance for the n@@ ails for the doors of the gates , and for the cou@@ pl@@ ings ; and br@@ ass in ab@@ und@@ ance without weight ;
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yah@@ we@@ h my God .
then you will prosp@@ er , if you observe to do the stat@@ utes and the ord@@ inan@@ ces which Yah@@ we@@ h gave Mos@@ es concerning Israel . be strong , and cour@@ age@@ ous . D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
there are also work@@ men with you in ab@@ und@@ ance , cut@@ ters and workers of stone and tim@@ ber , and all kinds of men who are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in every kind of work :
the L@@ evi@@ tes were num@@ ber@@ ed from thirty years old and up@@ ward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty @@@ -@@ @ eight thousand .
David said , " O@@ f these , twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand were to over@@ see the work of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; six thousand were officers and judges ;
Jah@@ ath was the chief , and Z@@ iz@@ ah the second : but Je@@ ush and Ber@@ i@@ ah di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have many sons ; therefore they became a fa@@ thers ' house in one rec@@ kon@@ ing .
David with Zad@@ ok of the sons of Ele@@ azar , and A@@ hi@@ me@@ le@@ ch of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , divided them according to their or@@ dering in their service .
of the Iz@@ har@@ ites , S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th ; of the sons of S@@ hel@@ omo@@ th , Jah@@ ath .
of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h : Z@@ acc@@ ur , and Joseph , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and As@@ har@@ e@@ lah , the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , under the hand of A@@ sap@@ h , who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied after the order of the king .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instruc@@ ted in singing to Yah@@ we@@ h , even all who were s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful , was two hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
for the divisions of the do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers : of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , Mes@@ he@@ lem@@ i@@ ah the son of k@@ ore , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h .
also to Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons : Sh@@ im@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fa@@ thers ' houses , for every gate .
these were the divisions of the do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers ; of the sons of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , and of the sons of Mer@@ ari .
of the L@@ evi@@ tes , A@@ hij@@ ah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of L@@ adan , the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites belonging to L@@ adan , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households belonging to L@@ adan the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite : Je@@ hi@@ eli .
he was of the children of Per@@ ez , the chief of all the cap@@ tains of the army for the first month .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est , chief : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
this is that Ben@@ ai@@ ah , who was the m@@ igh@@ ty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Am@@ m@@ iz@@ ab@@ ad his son .
furthermore over the tri@@ bes of Israel : of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites was Eli@@ ez@@ er the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri the ru@@ ler : of the Sime@@ on@@ ites , She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah :
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Hos@@ he@@ a the son of Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah : of the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Jo@@ el the son of P@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah :
but David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yah@@ we@@ h had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky .
Jo@@ a@@ b the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah began to number , but di@@ d@@ n '@@ t finish ; and there came wr@@ ath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chron@@ ic@@ les of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the tow@@ ers , was Jon@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and over the her@@ ds that f@@ ed in Shar@@ on was Sh@@ it@@ ra@@ i the Shar@@ on@@ ite : and over the her@@ ds that were in the val@@ ley@@ s was Sha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ad@@ la@@ i :
and over the ca@@ me@@ ls was O@@ bil the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elite : and over the don@@ ke@@ ys was J@@ eh@@ de@@ i@@ ah the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite : and over the f@@ loc@@ ks was Jaz@@ iz the Hag@@ r@@ ite .
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the for@@ ks , and the bas@@ ins , and the c@@ ups , of p@@ ure gold ; and for the golden bo@@ w@@ ls by weight for every bo@@ w@@ l ; and for the silver bo@@ w@@ ls by weight for every bo@@ w@@ l ;
and for the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se refin@@ ed gold by weight ; and gold for the pat@@ tern of the char@@ i@@ ot , the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , that spread out , and covered the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h .
even three thousand tal@@ ents of gold , of the gold of Op@@ hir , and seven thousand tal@@ ents of refin@@ ed silver , with which to over@@ lay the walls of the houses ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand tal@@ ents and ten thousand dar@@ ics , and of silver ten thousand tal@@ ents , and of br@@ ass E@@ igh@@ teen thousand tal@@ ents , and of iron a hundred thousand tal@@ ents .
they with whom pre@@ ci@@ ous stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , under the hand of Je@@ hi@@ el the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite .
then the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , because they offered will@@ ingly , because with a perfect heart they offered will@@ ingly to Yah@@ we@@ h : and David the king also re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with great joy .
both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
for we are st@@ ran@@ gers before you , and foreigners , as all our fa@@ thers were . our days on the ear@@ th are as a shadow , and there is no remaining .
Yah@@ we@@ h our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your hol@@ y name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
Yah@@ we@@ h mag@@ ni@@ fied Solomon exce@@ ed@@ ingly in the sight of all Israel , and bes@@ to@@ wed on him such royal maj@@ es@@ ty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
the time that he re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel was for@@ ty years ; he re@@ ig@@ ned seven years in He@@ br@@ on , and he re@@ ig@@ ned thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years in Jer@@ usalem .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every pr@@ ince in all Israel , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tent of Meet@@ ing of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
moreover the bronze alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , was there before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking coun@@ sel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze alt@@ ar before Yah@@ we@@ h , which was at the tent of Meet@@ ing , and offered one thousand bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on it .
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on , from before the tent of Meet@@ ing , to Jer@@ usalem ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned over Israel .
the king made silver and gold to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and c@@ ed@@ ars made he to be as the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that are in the low@@ land , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
" now therefore the wheat and the bar@@ ley , the oil and the wine , which my lor@@ d has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and you shall carry it up to Jer@@ usalem . "
Solomon num@@ ber@@ ed all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the num@@ ber@@ ing with which David his father had num@@ ber@@ ed them ; and they were found one hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ three thousand six hundred .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem on Mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was six@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the por@@ ch that was in front , its length , according to the b@@ read@@ th of the house , was twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the he@@ ight one hundred twenty ; and he over@@ laid it within with p@@ ure gold .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the th@@ res@@ holds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and en@@ gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m on the walls .
the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts long : the wing of the one was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , joining to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
the w@@ ings of these ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m spread themselves forth twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
also he made before the house two pil@@ lars of thirty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he made cha@@ ins in the or@@ acle , and put them on the tops of the pil@@ lars ; and he made one hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the cha@@ ins .
he set up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
also he made the m@@ ol@@ ten sea of ten cu@@ bi@@ ts from bri@@ m to bri@@ m , round in comp@@ ass ; and its he@@ ight was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and a line of thirty cu@@ bi@@ ts en@@ circ@@ led it .
under it was the lik@@ eness of ox@@ en , which en@@ circ@@ led it , for ten cu@@ bi@@ ts , en@@ cir@@ cling the sea . the ox@@ en were in two ro@@ ws , cast when it was cast .
it was a hand@@ b@@ read@@ th th@@ ick ; and its bri@@ m was worked like the bri@@ m of a c@@ up , like the f@@ lower of a L@@ ily : it received and held three thousand ba@@ ths .
he made the ten lam@@ p@@ stands of gold according to the ordin@@ ance concerning them ; and he set them in the temp@@ le , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temp@@ le , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred bas@@ ins of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the pri@@ ests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and over@@ laid their doors with br@@ ass .
Hur@@ am made the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins . so Hur@@ am made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
and the four hundred po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks ; two ro@@ ws of po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates for each network , to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the pil@@ lars .
and all the men of Israel assemb@@ led themselves to the king at the feast , which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tent of Meet@@ ing , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tent ; these the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes brought up .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led to him , were before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the po@@ les were so long that the ends of the po@@ les were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the Ar@@ k except the two tables which Mos@@ es put at Ho@@ re@@ b , when Yah@@ we@@ h made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
the king turned his face , and b@@ les@@ sed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed be Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who spoke with his m@@ outh to David my father , and has with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
but Yah@@ we@@ h said to David my father , ' whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" if a man sin against his neigh@@ bor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swe@@ ar , and he comes and swe@@ ars before your alt@@ ar in this house ;
then hear from heav@@ en , and for@@ give the sin of your people Israel , and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fa@@ thers .
whatever pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own pla@@ gue and his own sor@@ row , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
that they may fear you , to walk in your ways , so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fa@@ thers .
" if your people go out to battle against their enem@@ ies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear from heav@@ en , even from your d@@ wel@@ ling place , their pray@@ er and their peti@@ tions , and maintain their cause , and for@@ give your people who have sin@@ ned against you .
" now , my God , let , I be@@ g you , your eyes be open , and let your e@@ ars be atten@@ tive , to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
now when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing , the fire came down from heav@@ en , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; and the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house .
the pri@@ ests could not enter into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , because the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand head of c@@ attle , and a hundred and twenty thousand she@@ ep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
on the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their ten@@ ts , jo@@ y@@ ful and glad of heart for the Go@@ od@@ ness that Yah@@ we@@ h had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your pray@@ er , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
now my eyes shall be open , and my e@@ ars atten@@ tive , to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
but if you turn away , and for@@ sake my stat@@ utes and my comman@@ d@@ ments which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other go@@ ds , and worship them ;
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall say , ' Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and his own house ,
that the cities which Hur@@ am had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to d@@ well there .
also he built Beth Hor@@ on the up@@ per , and Beth Hor@@ on the lower , for@@ ti@@ fied cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people who were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consum@@ e , of them Solomon cons@@ crip@@ ted forced la@@ bor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots and of his hor@@ se@@ men .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and until it was finished . so the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was completed .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wis@@ dom .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and be@@ hold , the half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of your wis@@ dom was not told me : you exceed the f@@ ame that I heard .
King Solomon gave to the qu@@ een of She@@ ba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six tal@@ ents of gold ,
and there were six steps to the th@@ r@@ one , with a foot@@ st@@ ool of gold , which were fas@@ tened to the th@@ r@@ one , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two li@@ ons standing bes@@ ide the stays .
twelve li@@ ons stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps : there was nothing like it made in any k@@ ing@@ dom .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had ships that went to Tar@@ sh@@ ish with the servants of Hur@@ am ; once every three years came the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish , bringing gold , and silver , Iv@@ ory , and ap@@ es , and peac@@ oc@@ ks .
all the kings of the ear@@ th sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wis@@ dom , which God had put in his heart .
they brought every man his tri@@ bute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clo@@ thing , arm@@ or , and sp@@ ices , hor@@ ses , and mu@@ les , a rate year by year .
the king made silver to be in Jer@@ usalem as stones , and he made c@@ ed@@ ars to be as the sy@@ cam@@ ore trees that are in the low@@ land , for ab@@ und@@ ance .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took coun@@ sel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What coun@@ sel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jer@@ usalem , he assemb@@ led the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , one hundred eigh@@ ty thousand chosen men , who were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , to bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons cast them off , that they should not exec@@ ute the pri@@ est 's office to Yah@@ we@@ h ;
and he appointed him pri@@ ests for the high places , and for the male go@@ ats , and for the cal@@ ves which he had made .
Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took him a wife , Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of Jer@@ im@@ o@@ th the son of David , and of A@@ bi@@ ha@@ il the daughter of Eli@@ a@@ b the son of J@@ es@@ se ;
it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was established , and he was strong , that he for@@ so@@ ok the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all Israel with him .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the guard came and b@@ ore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
he re@@ ig@@ ned three years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Mic@@ ai@@ ah the daughter of U@@ ri@@ el of Gi@@ be@@ ah . there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
ought you not to know that Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David fore@@ ver , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
when Ju@@ da@@ h looked back , be@@ hold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cri@@ ed to Yah@@ we@@ h , and the pri@@ ests so@@ unded with the tr@@ ump@@ ets .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it happened , that God struck Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Ju@@ da@@ h prev@@ ailed , because they reli@@ ed on Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers .
A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah pursu@@ ed after Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , and took cities from him , Be@@ the@@ l with its towns , and J@@ es@@ han@@ ah with its towns , and E@@ ph@@ ron with its towns .
so A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and A@@ SA his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
there came out against them Zer@@ ah the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred char@@ i@@ ots ; and he came to Mar@@ es@@ ha@@ h .
but when in their dist@@ ress they turned to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troub@@ les were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
so they gathered themselves together at Jer@@ usalem in the third month , in the fif@@ teen@@ th year of the reign of A@@ SA .
they entered into the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , with all their heart and with all their sou@@ l ;
and that who@@ ever would not seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
all Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them rest all around .
he brought into God 's house the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
then A@@ SA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben Had@@ ad king of Syria , who lived at Dam@@ as@@ cus , saying ,
it happened , when Ba@@ as@@ ha heard of it , that he left off building Ram@@ ah , and let his work ce@@ ase .
then A@@ SA the king took all Ju@@ da@@ h ; and they carried away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and its tim@@ ber , with which Ba@@ as@@ ha had built ; and he built there@@ with Ge@@ ba and M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ ninth year of his reign A@@ SA was dis@@ eased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h , but to the physi@@ cians .
he placed forces in all the for@@ ti@@ fied cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ SA his father had taken .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his pr@@ inces , even Ben ha@@ il , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and Mic@@ ai@@ ah , to te@@ ach in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , having the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught among the people .
the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h fell on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the lands that were around Ju@@ da@@ h , so that they made no war against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at .
he had many works in the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and men of war , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , in Jer@@ usalem .
this was the num@@ ber@@ ing of them according to their fa@@ thers ' houses : of Ju@@ da@@ h , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
and next to him A@@ mas@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ic@@ hri , who will@@ ingly offered himself to Yah@@ we@@ h ; and with him two hundred thousand m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or .
after certain years he went down to A@@ ha@@ b to Samar@@ ia . A@@ ha@@ b killed she@@ ep and c@@ attle for him in ab@@ und@@ ance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ram@@ o@@ th G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah came near , and struck Mic@@ ai@@ ah on the che@@ ek , and said , " Wh@@ ich way did the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h go from me to speak to you ? "
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel pro@@ pped himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at lived at Jer@@ usalem : and he went out again among the people from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and brought them back to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers .
moreover in Jer@@ usalem J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at appointed L@@ evi@@ tes and pri@@ ests , and of the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for controversi@@ es . they returned to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened after this , that the children of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon , and with them some of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , came against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at to battle .
our God , will you not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us ; neither know we what to do , but our eyes are on you . "
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the Lev@@ ite , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , in the mid@@ st of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . be@@ hold , they are coming up by the as@@ cent of Z@@ iz . you shall find them at the end of the val@@ ley , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites and of the children of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with an exceeding l@@ oud voice .
when Ju@@ da@@ h came to the place over@@ looking the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , they looked at the multi@@ tude ; and be@@ hold , they were dead bodies fallen to the ear@@ th , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assemb@@ led themselves in the val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ah ; for there they b@@ les@@ sed Yah@@ we@@ h : therefore the name of that place was called The val@@ ley of Ber@@ ac@@ ah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , and J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in their fo@@ ref@@ ront , to go again to Jer@@ usalem with joy ; for Yah@@ we@@ h had made them to re@@ jo@@ ice over their enem@@ ies .
the fear of God was on all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the countries , when they heard that Yah@@ we@@ h fought against the enem@@ ies of Israel .
he walked in the way of A@@ SA his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hear@@ ts to the God of their fa@@ thers .
he had brothers , the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at : A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah , and Michael , and She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah ; all these were the sons of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Israel .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up over the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the s@@ word , and various also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
however Yah@@ we@@ h would not destroy the house of David , because of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lam@@ p to him and to his children always .
then J@@ eh@@ or@@ am passed over with his cap@@ tains , and all his char@@ i@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , along with the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots .
so E@@ dom revol@@ ted from under the hand of Ju@@ da@@ h to this day : then Lib@@ n@@ ah revol@@ ted at the same time from under his hand , because he had for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fa@@ thers .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for they were his coun@@ sel@@ ors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment on the house of A@@ ha@@ b , that he found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the brothers of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , minist@@ ering to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , and killed them .
now when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she ar@@ ose and destroyed all the royal se@@ ed of the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
all the assembly made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning the sons of David .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , except the pri@@ ests , and those who minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes . they shall come in , for they are hol@@ y , but all the people shall follow Yah@@ we@@ h 's instruc@@ tions .
the L@@ evi@@ tes shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . who@@ ever comes into the house , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds the spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the hor@@ se gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down , and broke his al@@ tar@@ s and his images in pieces , and killed Mat@@ tan the pri@@ est of Ba@@ al before the al@@ tar@@ s .
Jo@@ ash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned for@@ ty years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Zi@@ bi@@ ah , of Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
for the sons of Ath@@ ali@@ ah , that w@@ ic@@ ked woman , had broken up God 's house ; and they also gave all the dedicated things of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h to the Ba@@ als .
all the pr@@ inces and all the people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed , and brought in , and cast into the ch@@ est , until they had made an end .
so the work@@ men worked , and the work of rep@@ air@@ ing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
but Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; one hundred thirty years old was he when he died .
they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , and toward God and his house .
now after the death of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada came the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to the king . then the king list@@ ened to them .
they for@@ so@@ ok the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , and served the Ash@@ er@@ im and the id@@ ols : and wr@@ ath came on Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for this their guil@@ tin@@ ess .
thus Jo@@ ash the king di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember the kin@@ d@@ ness which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Yah@@ we@@ h look at it , and repay it . "
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ ad@@ dan , of Jer@@ usalem .
now it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , the army that had come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : therefore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in fierce an@@ ger .
A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Sal@@ t , and struck ten thousand of the children of Se@@ ir .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h consul@@ ted his advisers , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of J@@ eh@@ u , king of Israel , saying , " C@@ ome , let us look one another in the face . "
so Jo@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h looked one another in the face at Beth She@@ mes@@ h , which belongs to Ju@@ da@@ h .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah , first and last , be@@ hold , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel ?
now from the time that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah turned away from following Yah@@ we@@ h , they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem . he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish ; but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and killed him there .
all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h took Uz@@ zi@@ ah , who was six@@ teen years old , and made him king in the place of his father A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah .
six@@ teen years old was Uz@@ zi@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ ech@@ ili@@ ah , of Jer@@ usalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yah@@ we@@ h , God made him to prosp@@ er .
he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and broke down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d ; and he built cities in the country of Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah built tow@@ ers in Jer@@ usalem at the cor@@ ner gate , and at the val@@ ley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and for@@ ti@@ fied them .
the whole number of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , even the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , was two thousand and six hundred .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with m@@ igh@@ ty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah prepared for them , even for all the army , shi@@ elds , and spe@@ ars , and hel@@ me@@ ts , and co@@ ats of mail , and bo@@ ws , and stones for s@@ l@@ inging .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did cor@@ rup@@ tly , and he t@@ res@@ passed against Yah@@ we@@ h his God ; for he went into Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le to bur@@ n incen@@ se on the alt@@ ar of incen@@ se .
Jo@@ th@@ am was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Jer@@ us@@ ha@@ h the daughter of Zad@@ ok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done : however he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le . the people still did cor@@ rup@@ tly .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , like David his father ;
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
Z@@ ic@@ hri , a m@@ igh@@ ty man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , killed Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the king 's son , and Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am the ru@@ ler of the house , and El@@ kan@@ ah who was next to the king .
the children of Israel carried away cap@@ tive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and took also away much sp@@ oil from them , and brought the sp@@ oil to Samar@@ ia .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem for bon@@ d@@ servants and bon@@ d@@ ma@@ ids for yo@@ ur@@ selves . A@@ ren '@@ t there even with you t@@ res@@ passes of your own against Yah@@ we@@ h your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the cap@@ tives , that you have taken cap@@ tive from your brothers ; for the fierce wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h is on you . "
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and out of the house of the king and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t help him .
now the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bring him into the tom@@ bs of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and rep@@ aired them .
he brought in the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of Yah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the por@@ ch , and put out the lam@@ ps , and have not burned incen@@ se nor offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings in the hol@@ y place to the God of Israel .
now it is in my heart to make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , that his fierce an@@ ger may turn away from us .
my sons , don '@@ t be neg@@ lig@@ ent now ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and bur@@ n incen@@ se . "
moreover all the vessels , which king A@@ haz in his reign threw away when he t@@ res@@ passed , have we prepared and sanc@@ ti@@ fied ; and be@@ hold , they are before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
when they had made an end of offering , the king and all who were present with him bo@@ wed themselves and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
moreover H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king and the pr@@ inces comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes to sing pra@@ ises to Yah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of A@@ sap@@ h the se@@ er . they san@@ g pra@@ ises with gla@@ d@@ ness , and they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
also the bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings were in ab@@ und@@ ance , with the f@@ at of the peace offer@@ ings , and with the drink offer@@ ings for every bur@@ n@@ t offering . so the service of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h was set in order .
for the king had taken coun@@ sel , and his pr@@ inces , and all the assembly in Jer@@ usalem , to keep the P@@ ass@@ over in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the pri@@ ests had not sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jer@@ usalem .
they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they killed the P@@ ass@@ over on the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the second month : and the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes were as@@ ha@@ med , and sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves , and brought bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Mos@@ es the man of God : the pri@@ ests sp@@ rin@@ k@@ led the blood which they received of the hand of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves : therefore the L@@ evi@@ tes were in charge of killing the P@@ ass@@ overs for everyone who was not clean , to sanc@@ ti@@ fy them to Yah@@ we@@ h .
for H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h gave to the assembly for offer@@ ings one thousand bul@@ ls and seven thousand she@@ ep ; and the pr@@ inces gave to the assembly a thousand bul@@ ls and ten thousand she@@ ep : and a great number of pri@@ ests sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves .
all the assembly of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
moreover he comman@@ ded the people who lived in Jer@@ usalem to give the portion of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , that they might give themselves to the law of Yah@@ we@@ h .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the he@@ aps , and finished them in the seventh month .
after these things , and this fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness , Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came , and entered into Ju@@ da@@ h , and en@@ camp@@ ed against the for@@ ti@@ fied cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took coun@@ sel with his pr@@ inces and his m@@ igh@@ ty men to stop the waters of the spr@@ ings which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the spr@@ ings , and the Bro@@ ok that flow@@ ed through the mid@@ st of the land , saying , " Wh@@ y should the kings of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a come , and find much water ? "
he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
Do@@ es@@ n '@@ t H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you , to give you over to die by fam@@ ine and by thir@@ st , saying , ' Yah@@ we@@ h our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ? '
D@@ on '@@ t you know what I and my fa@@ thers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations which my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jer@@ usalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ gh@@ ten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
they spoke of the God of Jer@@ usalem , as of the go@@ ds of the peoples of the ear@@ th , which are the work of men 's hands .
thus Yah@@ we@@ h sav@@ ed H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and from the hand of all others , and gui@@ ded them on every side .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah had exceeding much ri@@ ches and hon@@ or : and he provided him treas@@ ur@@ ies for silver , and for gold , and for pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and for sp@@ ices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all kinds of good@@ ly vessels ;
this same H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah also stopped the up@@ per spring of the waters of G@@ ih@@ on , and brought them stra@@ ight down on the west side of the city of David . H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah prosp@@ ered in all his works .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his good de@@ eds , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z , in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , after the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
he pray@@ ed to him ; and he was ent@@ re@@ ated by him , and heard his supp@@ lic@@ ation , and brought him again to Jer@@ usalem into his k@@ ing@@ dom . then Man@@ as@@ se@@ h knew that Yah@@ we@@ h was God .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father ; and Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to all the en@@ gra@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them .
he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hum@@ ble himself before Yah@@ we@@ h , as Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had hum@@ b@@ led himself ; but this same Am@@ on t@@ res@@ passed more and more .
but the people of the land killed all those who had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and the work@@ men who la@@ bo@@ red in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h gave it to mend and repair the house ;
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the pri@@ est found the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h given by Mos@@ es .
Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
it happened , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es .
the king comman@@ ded H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the s@@ cri@@ be , and A@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the king 's ser@@ vant , saying ,
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , thus you shall tell him , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : " as tou@@ ching the words which you have heard ,
prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves after your fa@@ thers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fa@@ thers ' house of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
so the service was prepared , and the pri@@ ests stood in their place , and the L@@ evi@@ tes by their divisions , according to the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
they ro@@ asted the P@@ ass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the hol@@ y offer@@ ings bo@@ iled they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
so all the service of Yah@@ we@@ h was prepared the same day , to keep the P@@ ass@@ over , and to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of king Jos@@ i@@ ah .
Jerem@@ i@@ ah lamen@@ ted for Jos@@ i@@ ah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Jos@@ i@@ ah in their lament@@ ations to this day ; and they made them an ordin@@ ance in Israel : and be@@ hold , they are written in the lament@@ ations .
now the rest of the acts of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and his good de@@ eds , according to that which is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
and his acts , first and last , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
then the people of the land took Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , and made him king in his father 's place in Jer@@ usalem .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h his God .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put them in his temp@@ le at Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned three months and ten days in Jer@@ usalem : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
at the return of the year king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar sent , and brought him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , with the good@@ ly vessels of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and made Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem .
and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h his God ; he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hum@@ ble himself before Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t speaking from the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h .
he also rebel@@ led against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , who had made him swe@@ ar by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his nec@@ k , and har@@ dened his heart against turning to Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
moreover all the chiefs of the pri@@ ests , and the people , t@@ res@@ passed very greatly after all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations ; and they pollu@@ ted the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which he had made hol@@ y in Jer@@ usalem .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up early and sending , because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
but they mo@@ cked the mes@@ sen@@ gers of God , and desp@@ ised his words , and sco@@ ff@@ ed at his pro@@ ph@@ ets , until the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h ar@@ ose against his people , until there was no re@@ medy .
they bur@@ n@@ t God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jer@@ usalem , and bur@@ n@@ t all its pal@@ aces with fire , and destroyed all the good@@ ly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the s@@ word away to Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia :
then the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , and the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , even all whose spirit God had s@@ tir@@ red to go up rose up to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous things , besides all that was will@@ ingly offered .
the pri@@ ests : the children of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , of the house of J@@ es@@ hua , nine hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ three .
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ nine .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of H@@ ass@@ op@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ uda ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth Haz@@ z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of A@@ mi .
these were those who went up from Tel Me@@ lah , Tel Har@@ s@@ ha , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ dan , and Im@@ mer ; but they could not show their fa@@ thers ' houses , and their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two .
of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
these sought their place among those who were registered by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed pollu@@ ted and put from the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most hol@@ y things , until there stood up a pri@@ est with U@@ rim and with Th@@ um@@ m@@ im .
some of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , when they came to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem , offered will@@ ingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
so the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and some of the people , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
when the seventh month had come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jer@@ usalem .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the alt@@ ar on its base ; and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on it to Yah@@ we@@ h , even bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings morning and evening .
they kept the feast of ten@@ ts , as it is written , and offered the daily bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings by number , according to the ordin@@ ance , as the duty of every day required ;
and after@@ ward the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering , the offer@@ ings of the new mo@@ ons , of all the set fe@@ asts of Yah@@ we@@ h that were consec@@ rated , and of everyone who will@@ ingly offered a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h ; but the foundation of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le was not yet laid .
and hired coun@@ sel@@ ors against them , to fru@@ str@@ ate their purpose , all the days of Cy@@ ru@@ s king of Per@@ sia , even until the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us king of Per@@ sia .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , or toll , and in the end it will be hur@@ t@@ ful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dis@@ hon@@ or , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
I decre@@ ed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insur@@ rec@@ tion against kings , and that rebel@@ lion and se@@ di@@ tion have been made there@@ in .
there have been m@@ igh@@ ty kings also over Jer@@ usalem , who have ruled over all the country beyond the River ; and tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , and toll , was paid to them .
then when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
then rose up Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , and J@@ es@@ hua the son of Joz@@ ad@@ ak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jer@@ usalem ; and with them were the pro@@ ph@@ ets of God , helping them .
but the eye of their God was on the el@@ ders of the Jews , and they did not make them ce@@ ase , until the matter should come to Dar@@ i@@ us , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the cop@@ y of the letter that T@@ atten@@ ai , the governor beyond the River , and She@@ th@@ ar@@ boz@@ en@@ ai , and his compan@@ ions the Ap@@ har@@ s@@ achi@@ tes , who were beyond the River , sent to Dar@@ i@@ us the king ;
we asked them their names also , to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head .
but after that our fa@@ thers had provoked the God of heav@@ en to wr@@ ath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , the Chal@@ de@@ an , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and he said to him , ' T@@ ake these vessels , go , put them in the temp@@ le that is in Jer@@ usalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
then the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
then Dar@@ i@@ us the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archi@@ ves , where the treasures were laid up in Bab@@ yl@@ on .
there was found at A@@ ch@@ meth@@ a , in the palace that is in the province of Media , a s@@ cr@@ oll , and there@@ in was thus written for a record :
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the el@@ ders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
this house was finished on the third day of the month Ad@@ ar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Dar@@ i@@ us the king .
they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
for the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes had pur@@ ified themselves together ; all of them were p@@ ure : and they killed the P@@ ass@@ over for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their brothers the pri@@ ests , and for themselves .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the nations of the land , to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
for E@@ z@@ ra had set his heart to seek the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to do it , and to te@@ ach in Israel stat@@ utes and ord@@ inan@@ ces .
Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es , king of kings , to E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est , the s@@ cri@@ be of the law of the God of heav@@ en , perfect and so forth .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , who are min@@ ded of their own free will to go to Jer@@ usalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven coun@@ sel@@ ors , to inqu@@ ire concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his coun@@ sel@@ ors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habi@@ tation is in Jer@@ usalem ,
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jer@@ usalem .
whatever more shall be ne@@ ed@@ ful for the house of your God , which you shall have occasion to bes@@ to@@ w , bes@@ to@@ w it out of the king 's treasure house .
whatever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heav@@ en ; for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
now these are the heads of their fa@@ thers ' households , and this is the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of those who went up with me from Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king :
of the sons of Ph@@ ine@@ has , Ger@@ sho@@ m . of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , Daniel . of the sons of David , H@@ att@@ ush .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of Par@@ os@@ h , Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah ; and with him were rec@@ kon@@ ed by gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of the mal@@ es one hundred fif@@ ty .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el ; and with him three hundred mal@@ es .
of the sons of S@@ hel@@ om@@ ith , the son of Josip@@ hi@@ ah ; and with him one hundred six@@ ty mal@@ es .
of the sons of Ad@@ on@@ ik@@ am , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eli@@ phe@@ let , Je@@ uel , and Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah ; and with them six@@ ty mal@@ es .
I gathered them together to the river that runs to A@@ hava ; and there we en@@ camp@@ ed three days : and I viewed the people , and the pri@@ ests , and found there none of the sons of L@@ evi .
and of the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , whom David and the pr@@ inces had given for the service of the L@@ evi@@ tes , two hundred and twenty N@@ eth@@ in@@ im : all of them were mentioned by name .
watch , and keep them , until you we@@ igh them before the chiefs of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the rooms of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
so the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jer@@ usalem to the house of our God .
when I heard this thing , I t@@ ore my gar@@ ment and my ro@@ be , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down con@@ founded .
then were assemb@@ led to me everyone who tre@@ m@@ b@@ led at the words of the God of Israel , because of their t@@ res@@ pass of the cap@@ tivity ; and I sat con@@ founded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I ar@@ ose up from my hum@@ iliation , even with my gar@@ ment and my ro@@ be torn ; and I fell on my k@@ ne@@ es , and spread out my hands to Yah@@ we@@ h my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am as@@ ha@@ med and b@@ lus@@ h to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have increased over our head , and our guil@@ tin@@ ess has grown up to the heav@@ ens .
then E@@ z@@ ra ar@@ ose , and made the chiefs of the pri@@ ests , the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all Israel , to swe@@ ar that they would do according to this word . so they s@@ wor@@ e .
they made proc@@ lamation throughout Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem to all the children of the cap@@ tivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jer@@ usalem ;
the words of Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the son of Hac@@ ali@@ ah . now it happened in the month Ch@@ is@@ lev , in the tw@@ enti@@ eth year , as I was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
they said to me , " The re@@ mn@@ ant who are left of the cap@@ tivity there in the province are in great aff@@ li@@ ction and re@@ pro@@ ach . the wall of Jer@@ usalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days ; and I fas@@ ted and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
and said , " I be@@ g you , Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en , the great and aw@@ es@@ ome God , who keeps C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant and lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness with those who love him and keep his comman@@ d@@ ments :
we have dealt very cor@@ rup@@ tly against you , and have not kept the comman@@ d@@ ments , nor the stat@@ utes , nor the ord@@ inan@@ ces , which you comman@@ ded your ser@@ vant Mos@@ es .
" remember , I be@@ g you , the word that you comman@@ ded your ser@@ vant Mos@@ es , saying , ' If you t@@ res@@ pass , I will sc@@ at@@ ter you abroad among the peoples ;
then I came to the govern@@ ors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me cap@@ tains of the army and hor@@ se@@ men .
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then went I up in the night by the Bro@@ ok , and viewed the wall ; and I turned back , and entered by the val@@ ley gate , and so returned .
next to them , the Tek@@ o@@ ites made repairs ; but their no@@ bles di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put their nec@@ ks to the work of their lor@@ d .
Jo@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah and Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah rep@@ aired the old gate . they laid its be@@ ams , and set up its doors , and its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
next to them , Me@@ la@@ ti@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , and Jad@@ on the Mer@@ on@@ o@@ th@@ ite , the men of Gi@@ be@@ on , and of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , rep@@ aired the residence of the governor beyond the River .
next to him , Uz@@ zi@@ el the son of Har@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths , made repairs . next to him , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah one of the perf@@ um@@ ers made repairs , and they for@@ ti@@ fied Jer@@ usalem even to the broad wall .
next to them , Rep@@ ha@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ur , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Jer@@ usalem , made repairs .
next to him , S@@ hal@@ lum the son of Hal@@ lo@@ hes@@ h , the ru@@ ler of half the district of Jer@@ usalem , he and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , made repairs .
Han@@ un and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah rep@@ aired the val@@ ley gate . they built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars , and one thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts of the wall to the D@@ ung gate .
Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the district of Beth Hac@@ ch@@ er@@ em rep@@ aired the D@@ ung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
next to him , E@@ zer the son of J@@ es@@ hua , the ru@@ ler of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , rep@@ aired another portion , across from the as@@ cent to the arm@@ ory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Bin@@ n@@ u@@ i the son of Hen@@ ad@@ ad rep@@ aired another portion , from the house of A@@ zar@@ i@@ ah to the turning of the wall , and to the cor@@ ner .
after them , Zad@@ ok the son of Im@@ mer made repairs across from his own house . after him , Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of Sh@@ ec@@ an@@ i@@ ah , the keep@@ er of the east gate made repairs .
after him , Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of She@@ lem@@ i@@ ah , and Han@@ un the sixth son of Zal@@ ap@@ h , rep@@ aired another portion . after him , Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah made repairs across from his room .
after him , Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah one of the gol@@ d@@ sm@@ i@@ ths to the house of the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , and of the mer@@ chan@@ ts , made repairs over against the gate of Ham@@ m@@ ip@@ h@@ k@@ ad , and to the as@@ cent of the cor@@ ner .
but it happened that when San@@ bal@@ lat heard that we were building the wall , he was angry , and took great in@@ dign@@ ation , and mo@@ cked the Jews .
D@@ on '@@ t cover their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and don '@@ t let their sin be blo@@ t@@ ted out from before you ; for they have ins@@ ulted the buil@@ ders . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their s@@ words , their spe@@ ars , and their bo@@ ws .
it happened , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
they all built the wall and those who b@@ ore bur@@ den@@ s loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
and the buil@@ ders , everyone wor@@ e his s@@ word at his side , and so built . he who so@@ unded the tr@@ ump@@ et was by me .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his ser@@ vant lo@@ dge within Jer@@ usalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may la@@ bor in the day . "
so neither I , nor my brothers , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard who followed me , none of us took off our clo@@ th@@ es . everyone took his weapon to the water .
yes , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered there to the work .
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imag@@ ine them out of your own heart . "
he hired so that I would be afraid , do so , and sin , and that they might have material for an ev@@ il report , that they might re@@ pro@@ ach me .
moreover in those days the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h sent many letters to To@@ bi@@ ah , and To@@ bi@@ ah 's letters came to them .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the por@@ ters and the singers and the L@@ evi@@ tes were appointed ,
that I put my brother Han@@ ani , and Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jer@@ usalem ; for he was a fa@@ ith@@ ful man , and fear@@ ed God above many .
the pri@@ ests : the children of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah , of the house of J@@ es@@ hua , nine hundred sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ three .
the L@@ evi@@ tes : the children of J@@ es@@ hua , of Kad@@ mi@@ el , of the children of Ho@@ dev@@ ah , sev@@ enty @@@ -@@ @ four .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of So@@ ta@@ i , the children of Sop@@ her@@ eth , the children of Per@@ ida ,
the children of She@@ ph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ ch@@ er@@ eth Haz@@ z@@ eb@@ aim , the children of Am@@ on .
these were those who went up from Tel Me@@ lah , Tel Har@@ s@@ ha , Cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ don , and Im@@ mer ; but they could not show their fa@@ thers ' houses , nor their se@@ ed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of De@@ la@@ i@@ ah , the children of To@@ bi@@ ah , the children of N@@ ek@@ oda , six hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ two .
of the pri@@ ests : the children of H@@ ob@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
some from among the heads of fa@@ thers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treas@@ ury one thousand dar@@ ics of gold , fif@@ ty bas@@ ins , and five hundred thirty pri@@ ests ' gar@@ ments .
some of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households gave into the treas@@ ury of the work twenty thousand dar@@ ics of gold , and two thousand two hundred min@@ as of silver .
E@@ z@@ ra the pri@@ est brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
E@@ z@@ ra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
they read in the book , in the law of God , distinc@@ tly ; and they gave the sense , so that they understood the reading .
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send por@@ tions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h their God a fourth part of the day ; and a fourth part they conf@@ essed , and wor@@ shi@@ ped Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry land ; and you cast their pursu@@ ers into the dep@@ ths , as a stone into the m@@ igh@@ ty waters .
moreover , in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud you led them by day ; and in a pil@@ lar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
and made known to them your hol@@ y Sab@@ b@@ ath , and comman@@ ded them comman@@ d@@ ments , and stat@@ utes , and a law , by Mos@@ es your ser@@ vant ,
yes , when they had made them a m@@ ol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed aw@@ ful b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies ;
you gave also your good Spiri@@ t to instruc@@ t them , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t with@@ hold your man@@ na from their m@@ outh , and gave them water for their thir@@ st .
" yes , for@@ ty years you sustained them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . they la@@ cked nothing . their clo@@ th@@ es di@@ d@@ n '@@ t grow old , and their feet di@@ d@@ n '@@ t s@@ well .
you also multi@@ p@@ lied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
" nevertheless they were dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent , and rebel@@ led against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your pro@@ ph@@ ets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed aw@@ ful b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spiri@@ t through your pro@@ ph@@ ets . yet would they not give e@@ ar . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept your law , nor list@@ ened to your comman@@ d@@ ments and your testimon@@ ies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in your great Go@@ od@@ ness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
" be@@ hold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fa@@ thers to eat its fruit and its good , be@@ hold , we are servants in it .
now those who sealed were : Ne@@ hem@@ i@@ ah the governor , the son of Hac@@ ali@@ ah , and Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ,
and that we would not give our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to the peoples of the land , nor take their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters for our sons ;
and to bring the first fru@@ its of our ground , and the first fru@@ its of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
the pr@@ inces of the people lived in Jer@@ usalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem the hol@@ y city , and nine parts in the other cities .
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Col@@ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite .
all the sons of Per@@ ez who lived in Jer@@ usalem were four hundred six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight val@@ i@@ ant men .
and their brothers , m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight ; and their over@@ se@@ er was Z@@ ab@@ di@@ el , the son of Hag@@ g@@ ed@@ ol@@ im .
of the L@@ evi@@ tes : Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah the son of H@@ ass@@ hub , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of Has@@ habi@@ ah , the son of Bun@@ ni ;
and Sha@@ b@@ be@@ th@@ ai and Joz@@ ab@@ ad , of the chiefs of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who had the over@@ sight of the ou@@ tw@@ ard business of God 's house ;
P@@ eth@@ a@@ hi@@ ah the son of Mes@@ he@@ zab@@ el , of the children of Zer@@ ah the son of Ju@@ da@@ h , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
as for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h lived in Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba and its towns , and in Di@@ bon and its towns , and in J@@ ek@@ ab@@ z@@ e@@ el and its villages ,
J@@ es@@ hua became the father of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im became the father of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , and Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b became the father of Jo@@ i@@ ada ,
the sons of L@@ evi , heads of fa@@ thers ' households , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets : Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h ;
by the spring gate , and stra@@ ight before them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the as@@ cent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
they performed the duty of their God , and the duty of the pur@@ ification , and so did the singers and the por@@ ters , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of David , and of Solomon his son .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ abi@@ te should not enter into the assembly of God fore@@ ver ,
now before this , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the pri@@ est , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being al@@ lied to To@@ bi@@ ah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jer@@ usalem ; for in the two and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es king of Bab@@ yl@@ on I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jer@@ usalem , and understood the ev@@ il that Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b had done for To@@ bi@@ ah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I comman@@ ded , and they cleans@@ ed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the me@@ al offer@@ ings and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them ; so that the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don '@@ t wi@@ pe out my good de@@ eds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its obser@@ van@@ ces .
there lived men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , who brought in fish , and all kinds of war@@ es , and sold on the Sab@@ b@@ ath to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
and their children spoke half in the speech of Ash@@ do@@ d , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est , was son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
thus I cleans@@ ed them from all foreigners , and appointed duties for the pri@@ ests and for the L@@ evi@@ tes , everyone in his work ;
now it happened in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us who re@@ ig@@ ned from India even to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his pr@@ inces and his servants ; the power of Per@@ sia and Media , the no@@ bles and pr@@ inces of the provinces , being before him .
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not comp@@ ul@@ sory ; for so the king had instruc@@ ted all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleas@@ ure .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times , ( for it was the king 's cust@@ om to cons@@ ult those who knew law and judgment ;
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his k@@ ing@@ dom ( for it is great ) , all the wi@@ ves will give their hus@@ bands hon@@ or , both great and small . "
after these things , when the wr@@ ath of King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us was p@@ ac@@ ified , he remember@@ ed V@@ ash@@ ti , and what she had done , and what was decre@@ ed against her .
there was a certain J@@ ew in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a , whose name was Mor@@ dec@@ ai , the son of J@@ air , the son of Shi@@ me@@ i , the son of K@@ ish , a Benj@@ am@@ ite ,
who had been carried away from Jer@@ usalem with the cap@@ tives who had been carried away with J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had carried away .
Mor@@ dec@@ ai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Es@@ ther was doing , and what would become of her .
so Es@@ ther was taken to King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us into his royal house in the tenth month , which is the month Te@@ bet@@ h , in the seventh year of his reign .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , who were do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
then the king 's servants , who were in the king 's gate , said to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , " Wh@@ y do you dis@@ obe@@ y the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment ? "
when Ham@@ an saw that Mor@@ dec@@ ai di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bo@@ w down , nor pay him H@@ om@@ age , Ham@@ an was full of wr@@ ath .
the king said to Ham@@ an , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
the cour@@ i@@ ers went forth in has@@ te by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and the decree was given out in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a . the king and Ham@@ an sat down to drink ; but the city of Sh@@ us@@ han was per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed .
now when Mor@@ dec@@ ai found out all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th with ashes , and went out into the mid@@ st of the city , and w@@ ailed l@@ ou@@ dly and a bit@@ ter@@ ly .
Es@@ ther 's ma@@ i@@ den@@ s and her e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s came and told her this , and the qu@@ een was exce@@ ed@@ ingly gri@@ ev@@ ed . she sent clo@@ thing to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to replace his s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive it .
then Es@@ ther called for H@@ ath@@ ach , one of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , whom he had appointed to attend her , and comman@@ ded him to go to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then the king said , " Br@@ ing Ham@@ an quickly , so that it may be done as Es@@ ther has said . " so the king and Ham@@ an came to the ban@@ qu@@ et that Es@@ ther had prepared .
the king said to Es@@ ther at the ban@@ qu@@ et of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the k@@ ing@@ dom it shall be performed . "
then Ham@@ an went out that day jo@@ y@@ ful and glad of heart , but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wr@@ ath against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
Ham@@ an re@@ counted to them the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , the multi@@ tude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night , the king co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t sle@@ ep . he comman@@ ded the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les to be brought , and they were read to the king .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered , " If I have found fav@@ or in your sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
for how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the ev@@ il that would come to my people ? how can I en@@ dur@@ e to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
he wrote in the name of King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by Cour@@ ier on hor@@ se@@ back , ri@@ ding on royal hor@@ ses that were bread from swift ste@@ eds .
a cop@@ y of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ en@@ ge themselves on their enem@@ ies .
so the cour@@ i@@ ers who ro@@ de on royal hor@@ ses went out , has@@ tened and pressed on by the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment . the decree was given out in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a .
for Mor@@ dec@@ ai was great in the king 's house , and his f@@ ame went out throughout all the provinces ; for the man Mor@@ dec@@ ai grew greater and greater .
the Jews struck all their enem@@ ies with the stro@@ ke of the s@@ word , and with sla@@ ughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who ha@@ ted them .
they killed Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , Dal@@ ph@@ on , A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
on that day , the number of those who were sla@@ in in the c@@ it@@ ade@@ l of Sus@@ a was brought before the king .
his pos@@ sessions also were seven thousand she@@ ep , three thousand ca@@ me@@ ls , five hundred yok@@ e of ox@@ en , five hundred female don@@ ke@@ ys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to S@@ atan , " W@@ here have you come from ? " then S@@ atan answ@@ ered Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " From going back and forth in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it . "
it fell on a day when his sons and his da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house ,
and the Sab@@ e@@ ans attacked , and took them away . yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the s@@ word , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Y@@ our sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were e@@ ating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house ,
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Yah@@ we@@ h , that S@@ atan came also among them to present himself before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so S@@ atan went forth from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h , and struck Jo@@ b with painful so@@ res from the sole of his fo@@ ot to his head .
so they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven n@@ ights , and none spoke a word to him , for they saw that his gri@@ ef was very great .
let d@@ ark@@ ness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cl@@ oud d@@ well on it . let all that makes black the day ter@@ ri@@ fy it .
as for that night , let th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize on it . let it not re@@ jo@@ ice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its tw@@ il@@ ight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the ey@@ eli@@ ds of the morning ,
because it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t shut up the doors of my mother 's w@@ om@@ b , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
" why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t I die from the w@@ om@@ b ? why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t I give up the spirit when my mother b@@ ore me ?
for now should I have la@@ in down and been quiet . I should have sle@@ pt , then I would have been at rest ,
for the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me .
the ro@@ aring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , the te@@ eth of the young li@@ ons , are broken .
how much more , those who d@@ well in houses of cla@@ y , whose foundation is in the d@@ ust , who are cr@@ us@@ hed before the mo@@ th !
so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mour@@ n are ex@@ al@@ ted to safety .
you shall be hidden from the s@@ cour@@ ge of the ton@@ gue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes .
for you shall be al@@ lied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of gra@@ in comes in its season .
be it still my con@@ so@@ lation , yes , let me ex@@ ult in p@@ ain that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t spar@@ e , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
Is@@ n '@@ t it that I have no help in me , That wis@@ dom is driven quite from me ?
" to him who is ready to fa@@ int , kin@@ d@@ ness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who for@@ sak@@ es the fear of the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I Tos@@ s and turn until the da@@ w@@ ning of the day .
why do you not par@@ don my dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and take away my in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I lie down in the d@@ ust . you will seek me dil@@ ig@@ ently , but I shall not be . "
be@@ hold , he goes by me , and I don '@@ t see him . he passes on also , but I don '@@ t perce@@ ive him .
if it is a matter of strength , be@@ hold , he is m@@ igh@@ ty ! if of justice , ' Wh@@ o , ' says he , ' will sum@@ mon me ? '
the ear@@ th is given into the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
if I say , ' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and che@@ er up ; '
" my sou@@ l is we@@ ary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
is it good to you that you should op@@ press , that you should desp@@ ise the work of your hands , and sm@@ ile on the coun@@ sel of the w@@ ic@@ ked ?
although you know that I am not w@@ ic@@ ked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the w@@ om@@ b ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the w@@ om@@ b to the grave .
that he would show you the secre@@ ts of wis@@ dom ! for true wis@@ dom has two sides . know therefore that God ex@@ acts of you less than your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity de@@ serves .
if in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is in your hand , put it far away . D@@ on '@@ t let un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness d@@ well in your ten@@ ts .
su@@ rely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Y@@ es , you shall be stead@@ fast , and shall not fear :
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
also you shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid . yes , many shall court your fav@@ or .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not in@@ fer@@ ior to you . yes , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know such things as these ?
I am like one who is a j@@ oke to his neigh@@ bor , I , who called on God , and he answ@@ ered . the just , the bla@@ me@@ less man is a j@@ oke .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is con@@ temp@@ t for mis@@ fortun@@ e . it is ready for them whose fo@@ ot sli@@ ps .
who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know that in all these , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h has done this ,
be@@ hold , he breaks down , and it can '@@ t be built again . he im@@ prisons a man , and there can be no release .
be@@ hold , he With@@ holds the waters , and they d@@ ry up . again , he sends them out , and they over@@ turn the ear@@ th .
he re@@ moves the speech of those who are tr@@ usted , and takes away the understanding of the el@@ ders .
he takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the ear@@ th , and causes them to w@@ ander in a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness where there is no way .
you also put my feet in the sto@@ cks , and mark all my p@@ aths . you set a bound to the so@@ les of my feet ,
he comes forth like a f@@ lower , and is cut down . he also fle@@ es like a shadow , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t continue .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bo@@ unds that he can '@@ t pass ;
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will s@@ pro@@ ut again , that the tender branch of it will not ce@@ ase .
so man lies down and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t rise . until the heav@@ ens are no more , they shall not aw@@ ake , nor be ro@@ used out of their sle@@ ep .
" O@@ h that you would hide me in She@@ ol , that you would keep me secret , until your wr@@ ath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
you would call , and I would answer you . you would have a desire to the work of your hands .
the waters wear the stones . the tor@@ ren@@ ts of it was@@ h away the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th . so you destroy the hope of man .
his sons come to hon@@ or , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know it . they are brought low , but he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t perce@@ ive it of them .
what is man , that he should be clean ? what is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righ@@ te@@ ous ?
be@@ hold , he puts no trust in his hol@@ y ones . yes , the heav@@ ens are not clean in his sight ;
the w@@ ic@@ ked man wri@@ th@@ es in p@@ ain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the op@@ pres@@ sor .
he w@@ and@@ ers abroad for bread , saying , ' W@@ here is it ? ' he knows that the day of d@@ ark@@ ness is ready at his hand .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his sub@@ stance continue , neither shall their pos@@ sessions be extended on the ear@@ th .
he shall not de@@ part out of d@@ ark@@ ness . the fla@@ me shall d@@ ry up his branches . by the bre@@ ath of God 's m@@ outh shall he go away .
I also could speak as you do . if your sou@@ l were in my sou@@ l 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
he has torn me in his wr@@ ath , and persec@@ uted me . he has gn@@ ashed on me with his te@@ eth . my ad@@ versary shar@@ pen@@ s his eyes on me .
they have g@@ ap@@ ed on me with their m@@ outh . they have struck me on the che@@ ek re@@ pro@@ ach@@ fully . they gather themselves together against me .
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the nec@@ k , and d@@ ashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .
his ar@@ chers sur@@ round me . he sp@@ l@@ its my kid@@ neys apart , and does not spar@@ e . he po@@ urs out my g@@ all on the ground .
if I have said to corruption , ' You are my father ; ' to the wor@@ m , ' My mother , ' and ' my sister ; '
he shall be rooted out of his tent where he tru@@ sts . he shall be brought to the king of terr@@ ors .
there shall d@@ well in his tent that which is none of his . sul@@ f@@ ur shall be sc@@ at@@ tered on his habi@@ tation .
he has wal@@ led up my way so that I can '@@ t pass , and has set d@@ ark@@ ness in my p@@ aths .
those who d@@ well in my house , and my ma@@ ids , count me for a st@@ ran@@ ger . I am an ali@@ en in their sight .
I call to my ser@@ vant , and he gives me no answer . I be@@ g him with my m@@ outh .
my bre@@ ath is offensive to my wife . I am lo@@ ath@@ some to the children of my own mother .
but as for me , I know that my Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer lives . in the end , he will stand upon the ear@@ th .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a st@@ ran@@ ger . " my heart is consu@@ med within me .
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found . yes , he shall be ch@@ ased away like a vision of the night .
he has sw@@ allowed down ri@@ ches , and he shall v@@ om@@ it them up again . God will cast them out of his bel@@ ly .
that for which he la@@ bo@@ red he shall restore , and shall not sw@@ allow it down . according to the sub@@ stance that he has gotten , he shall not re@@ jo@@ ice .
for he has op@@ pressed and for@@ sak@@ en the poor . he has viol@@ ently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up .
in the ful@@ l@@ ness of his suffici@@ ency , dist@@ ress shall over@@ take him . the hand of everyone who is in mis@@ ery shall come on him .
when he is about to fill his bel@@ ly , God will cast the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his wr@@ ath on him . it will rain on him while he is e@@ ating .
he draws it forth , and it comes out of his body . yes , the g@@ lit@@ tering point comes out of his li@@ ver . Terr@@ ors are on him .
all d@@ ark@@ ness is laid up for his treasures . an un@@ fan@@ ned fire shall dev@@ our him . it shall consum@@ e that which is left in his tent .
" how often is it that the lam@@ p of the w@@ ic@@ ked is put out , that their cal@@ am@@ ity comes on them , that God distribu@@ tes sor@@ ro@@ ws in his an@@ ger ?
you say , ' God lays up his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity for his children . ' let him re@@ compen@@ se it to himself , that he may know it .
you ha@@ ven '@@ t given water to the we@@ ary to drink , and you have with@@ held bread from the hun@@ gry .
th@@ ick cl@@ ou@@ ds are a covering to him , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see . he walk@@ s on the va@@ ult of the sky . '
saying , ' su@@ rely those who rose up against us are cut off . the fire has consu@@ med their re@@ mn@@ ant . '
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall sh@@ ine on your ways .
he works to the north , but I can '@@ t see him . he turns south , but I can '@@ t catch a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of him .
my fo@@ ot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned aside .
I ha@@ ven '@@ t gone back from the comman@@ d@@ ment of his li@@ ps . I have treas@@ ured up the words of his m@@ outh more than my necessary food .
because I was not cut off before the d@@ ark@@ ness , neither did he cover the th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness from my face .
from out of the popul@@ ous city , men gro@@ an . the sou@@ l of the wounded cri@@ es out , yet God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t regard the Fol@@ ly .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don '@@ t know its ways , nor stay in its p@@ aths .
in the dark they di@@ g through houses . they shut themselves up in the day@@ time . they don '@@ t know the light .
the w@@ om@@ b shall forget him . the wor@@ m shall fe@@ ed swe@@ et@@ ly on him . he shall be no more remember@@ ed . Un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall be broken as a tree .
far be it from me that I should justify you . until I die I will not put away my integrity from me .
I hold fast to my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not re@@ pro@@ ach me so long as I live .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
for it hur@@ ls at him , and does not spar@@ e , as he fle@@ es away from his hand .
he breaks open a S@@ haf@@ t away from where people live . they are forgotten by the fo@@ ot . they han@@ g far from men , they s@@ wing back and forth .
he bin@@ ds the stre@@ ams that they don '@@ t tri@@ ck@@ le . the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light .
he establis@@ hes the force of the wind . yes , he measures out the waters by measure .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
the voice of the no@@ bles was hus@@ hed , and their ton@@ gue st@@ uck to the ro@@ of of their m@@ outh .
for when the e@@ ar heard me , then it b@@ les@@ sed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commen@@ ded me :
the b@@ les@@ sing of him who was ready to per@@ ish came on me , and I caused the wi@@ dow 's heart to sing for joy .
I was a father to the ne@@ edy . the cause of him who I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know , I searched out .
if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any def@@ il@@ ement has st@@ uck to my hands ,
then let me so@@ w , and let another eat . yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out .
for that would be a he@@ in@@ ous crime . yes , it would be an in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be punished by the judges :
" if I have desp@@ ised the cause of my male ser@@ vant or of my female ser@@ vant , when they conten@@ ded with me ;
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I gui@@ ded from my mother 's w@@ om@@ b ) ;
then let my sho@@ ul@@ der fall from the sho@@ ul@@ der bla@@ de , and my arm be broken from the bone .
this also would be an in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above .
( yes , I have not allowed my m@@ outh to sin by asking his life with a cur@@ se ) ;
then the wr@@ ath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el , the Buz@@ ite , of the family of R@@ am , was kin@@ d@@ led against Jo@@ b . his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led because he justified himself rather than God .
" be@@ hold , I w@@ aited for your words , and I list@@ ened for your reas@@ oning , while you searched out what to say .
yes , I gave you my full attention , but there was no one who convinced Jo@@ b , or who answ@@ ered his words , among you .
I will speak , that I may be ref@@ res@@ hed . I will open my li@@ ps and answer .
for I don '@@ t know how to give f@@ lat@@ tering titles ; or else my Mak@@ er would soon take me away .
" su@@ rely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sle@@ ep falls on men , in s@@ lum@@ ber@@ ing on the bed ;
for the work of a man he will ren@@ der to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . he heard the cry of the aff@@ lic@@ ted .
" do you think this to be your right , or do you say , ' My righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is more than God 's , '
that you ask , ' What advantage will it be to you ? what profit shall I have , more than if I had sin@@ ned ? '
if you have sin@@ ned , what effect do you have against him ? if your trans@@ gres@@ sions are multi@@ p@@ lied , what do you do to him ?
how much less when you say you don '@@ t see him . the cause is before him , and you wait for him !
he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t preserve the life of the w@@ ic@@ ked , but gives to the aff@@ lic@@ ted their right .
he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t withdraw his eyes from the righ@@ te@@ ous , but with kings on the th@@ r@@ one , he sets them fore@@ ver , and they are ex@@ al@@ ted .
but if they don '@@ t listen , they shall per@@ ish by the s@@ word ; they shall die without knowledge .
yes , he would have al@@ lu@@ red you out of dist@@ ress , into a broad place , where there is no re@@ stri@@ ction . that which is set on your table would be full of fat@@ ness .
for he says to the snow , ' F@@ all on the ear@@ th ; ' likewise to the sho@@ wer of rain , and to the sho@@ wers of his m@@ igh@@ ty rain .
it is turned around by his gu@@ idance , that they may do whatever he comman@@ ds them on the sur@@ face of the habi@@ table world ,

to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , in which there is no man ;

they are joined one to another . they stick together , so that they can '@@ t be pulled apart .
the f@@ lak@@ es of his f@@ les@@ h are joined together . they are firm on him . they can '@@ t be moved .
you asked , ' Wh@@ o is this who hi@@ des coun@@ sel without knowledge ? ' therefore I have ut@@ tered that which I did not understand , things too won@@ der@@ ful for me , which I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know .

they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the f@@ les@@ h of your sa@@ ints to the animals of the ear@@ th .

he sav@@ ed them from the hand of him who ha@@ ted them , and re@@ deemed them from the hand of the enemy .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had Mos@@ es , his chosen , not stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wr@@ ath , so that he wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t destroy them .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom they sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to the id@@ ols of Can@@ a@@ an . the land was pollu@@ ted with blood .
and gathered out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south .

he will fulfill the desire of those who fear him . he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
D@@ on '@@ t put your trust in pr@@ inces , each a son of man in whom there is no help .

I also will la@@ ug@@ h at your disaster . I will mo@@ ck when cal@@ am@@ ity over@@ takes you ;
he lays up sound wis@@ dom for the u@@ pri@@ ght . he is a shield to those who walk in integrity ;
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sle@@ ep will be swe@@ et .
D@@ on '@@ t with@@ hold good from those to whom it is due , when it is in the power of your hand to do it .
when you go , your steps will not be hampered . when you run , you will not st@@ um@@ ble .
D@@ on '@@ t enter into the path of the w@@ ic@@ ked . D@@ on '@@ t walk in the way of ev@@ il men .
for they don '@@ t sle@@ ep , unless they do ev@@ il . their sle@@ ep is taken away , unless they make someone fall .
my son , if you have become col@@ lateral for your neigh@@ bor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a st@@ ran@@ ger ;
you are tra@@ pped by the words of your m@@ outh . you are en@@ s@@ nar@@ ed with the words of your m@@ outh .
when you walk , it will lead you . when you sle@@ ep , it will watch over you . when you aw@@ ake , it will talk with you .
I have spread my cou@@ ch with car@@ p@@ ets of tap@@ es@@ try , with stri@@ ped clo@@ ths of the yar@@ n of Egypt .
bes@@ ide the gates , at the entry of the city , at the entry doors , she cri@@ es al@@ oud :
when he established the heav@@ ens , I was there ; when he set a circ@@ le on the sur@@ face of the deep ,
when he gave to the sea its bo@@ und@@ ary , that the waters should not violate his comman@@ d@@ ment , when he marked out the foundations of the ear@@ th ;
she has prepared her meat . she has mixed her wine . she has also set her table .
instruc@@ t a wise man , and he will be still wis@@ er . te@@ ach a righ@@ te@@ ous man , and he will increase in learning .
Yah@@ we@@ h will not allow the sou@@ l of the righ@@ te@@ ous to go hun@@ gry , but he th@@ ru@@ sts away the desire of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
he who ga@@ thers in summer is a wise son , but he who sle@@ ep@@ s during the har@@ v@@ est is a son who causes sh@@ ame .
wis@@ dom is found on the li@@ ps of him who has dis@@ cer@@ n@@ ment , but a ro@@ d is for the back of him who is vo@@ id of understanding .
the way of Yah@@ we@@ h is a stron@@ gh@@ old to the u@@ pri@@ ght , but it is a destruction to the workers of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
one who brings g@@ os@@ sip bet@@ r@@ ays a confidence , but one who is of a tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy spirit is one who keeps a secret .
a gr@@ ac@@ ious woman ob@@ tains hon@@ or , but violent men obtain ri@@ ches .
those who are per@@ verse in heart are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , but those whose ways are bla@@ me@@ less are his de@@ light .
there is one who sc@@ at@@ ters , and increases yet more . there is one who With@@ holds more than is appropriate , but gains poverty .
the words of the w@@ ic@@ ked are about lying in wait for blood , but the speech of the u@@ pri@@ ght resc@@ ues them .
a man shall be commen@@ ded according to his wis@@ dom , but he who has a war@@ ped mind shall be desp@@ ised .
better is he who is lightly es@@ te@@ emed , and has a ser@@ vant , than he who hon@@ ors himself , and lacks bread .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his m@@ outh . the work of a man 's hands shall be re@@ warded to him .
there are some who pre@@ tend to be rich , yet have nothing . there are some who pre@@ tend to be poor , yet have great wealth .
good understanding wins fav@@ or ; but the way of the un@@ fa@@ ith@@ ful is hard .
a good man leaves an inher@@ it@@ ance to his children 's children , but the wealth of the sin@@ ner is stored for the righ@@ te@@ ous .
in the multi@@ tude of people is the king 's gl@@ ory , but in the lack of people is the destruction of the pr@@ ince .
he who is slow to an@@ ger has great understanding , but he who has a quick tem@@ per dis@@ plays Fol@@ ly .
the king 's fav@@ or is toward a ser@@ vant who deals wis@@ ely , but his wr@@ ath is toward one who causes sh@@ ame .
when a man 's ways ple@@ ase Yah@@ we@@ h , he makes even his enem@@ ies to be at peace with him .
how much better it is to get wis@@ dom than gold ! yes , to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver .
one who win@@ ks his eyes to plot per@@ versities , one who com@@ pres@@ ses his li@@ ps , is b@@ ent on ev@@ il .
one who is slow to an@@ ger is better than the m@@ igh@@ ty ; one who rules his spirit , than he who takes a city .
he who justi@@ fies the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he who condem@@ ns the righ@@ te@@ ous , both of them alike are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h .
wis@@ dom is before the face of one who has understanding , but the eyes of a fo@@ ol w@@ ander to the ends of the ear@@ th .
even a fo@@ ol , when he keeps silent , is counted wise . when he sh@@ u@@ ts his li@@ ps , he is thought to be dis@@ cer@@ ning .
one who is S@@ lack in his work is brother to him who is a master of destruction .
a man 's st@@ om@@ ach is filled with the fruit of his m@@ outh . with the har@@ v@@ est of his li@@ ps he is satisfied .
it is@@ n '@@ t good to have z@@ e@@ al without knowledge ; nor being has@@ ty with one 's feet and missing the way .
the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h leads to life , then cont@@ ent@@ ment ; he rests and will not be touched by trouble .
the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d bur@@ ies his hand in the dish ; he will not so much as bring it to his m@@ outh again .
the terror of a king is like the ro@@ aring of a lion . he who provok@@ es him to an@@ ger for@@ fe@@ its his own life .
the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d will not plo@@ w by reason of the winter ; therefore he shall be@@ g in har@@ v@@ est , and have nothing .
D@@ on '@@ t love sle@@ ep , lest you come to poverty . open your eyes , and you shall be satisfied with bread .
it is a sn@@ are to a man to make a ras@@ h dedic@@ ation , then later to consider his vows .
who@@ ever stops his e@@ ars at the cry of the poor , he will also cry out , but shall not be heard .
the man who w@@ and@@ ers out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not de@@ part from it .
for it is a pleas@@ ant thing if you keep them within you , if all of them are ready on your li@@ ps .
D@@ on '@@ t you be one of those who strike hands , of those who are col@@ lateral for debts .
why do you set your eyes on that which is not ? for it certainly s@@ pro@@ u@@ ts w@@ ings like an e@@ ag@@ le and f@@ lies in the sky .
D@@ on '@@ t look at the wine when it is red , when it spar@@ k@@ les in the c@@ up , when it goes down smoothly .
yes , you will be as he who lies down in the mid@@ st of the sea , or as he who lies on top of the ri@@ gging :
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don '@@ t feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
rescue those who are being led away to death ! indeed , hold back those who are stag@@ gering to the sla@@ ughter !
so you shall know wis@@ dom to be to your sou@@ l ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
D@@ on '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice when your enemy falls . D@@ on '@@ t let your heart be glad when he is over@@ thrown ;
for there will be no reward to the ev@@ il man ; and the lam@@ p of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall be sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ed out .
D@@ on '@@ t say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will ren@@ der to the man according to his work . "
I went by the field of the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d , by the v@@ ine@@ yard of the man vo@@ id of understanding ;
be@@ hold , it was all grown over with thor@@ ns . its sur@@ face was covered with net@@ t@@ les , and its stone wall was broken down .
for it is better that it be said to you , " C@@ ome up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the pr@@ ince , whom your eyes have seen .
as the cold of snow in the time of har@@ v@@ est , so is a fa@@ ith@@ ful mes@@ sen@@ ger to those who send him ; for he ref@@ res@@ hes the sou@@ l of his mas@@ ters .
have you found hon@@ ey ? eat as much as is sufficient for you , lest you eat too much , and v@@ om@@ it it .
if your enemy is hun@@ gry , give him food to eat . if he is thir@@ st@@ y , give him water to drink :
like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man whose spirit is without restra@@ int .
like the leg@@ s of the la@@ me that han@@ g loose : so is a par@@ able in the m@@ outh of fo@@ ols .
as one who bin@@ ds a stone in a s@@ ling , so is he who gives hon@@ or to a fo@@ ol .
the s@@ lu@@ g@@ gar@@ d bur@@ ies his hand in the dish . he is too la@@ zy to bring it back to his m@@ outh .
D@@ on '@@ t for@@ sake your friend and your father 's friend . D@@ on '@@ t go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neigh@@ bor who is near than a distant brother .
he who b@@ les@@ ses his neigh@@ bor with a l@@ oud voice early in the morning , it will be taken as a cur@@ se by him .
though you gr@@ ind a fo@@ ol in a mort@@ ar with a p@@ est@@ le along with gra@@ in , yet his fo@@ ol@@ ishness will not be removed from him .
there will be plenty of go@@ ats ' milk for your food , for your family 's food , and for the no@@ ur@@ is@@ hment of your ser@@ vant girls .
better is the poor who walk@@ s in his integrity , than he who is per@@ verse in his ways , and he is rich .
one who works his land will have an ab@@ und@@ ance of food ; but one who ch@@ ases fan@@ tas@@ ies will have his fill of poverty .
who@@ ever ro@@ bs his father or his mother , and says , " It 's not wrong . " he is a partner with a destro@@ yer .
if a wise man goes to court with a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , the fo@@ ol ra@@ ges or sco@@ ffs , and there is no peace .
who@@ ever is an accomp@@ lice of a th@@ i@@ ef is an enemy of his own sou@@ l . he takes an oath , but dar@@ es not testify .
lest I be full , deny you , and say , ' Wh@@ o is Yah@@ we@@ h ? ' or lest I be poor , and ste@@ al , and so dis@@ hon@@ or the name of my God .
there is a generation whose te@@ eth are like s@@ words , and their j@@ a@@ ws like k@@ ni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from the ear@@ th , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
" the eye that mo@@ cks at his father , and scor@@ ns obe@@ di@@ ence to his mother : the ra@@ ven@@ s of the val@@ ley shall pick it out , the young e@@ ag@@ les shall eat it .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ iden .
for as the chur@@ ning of milk brings forth but@@ ter , and the wr@@ inging of the n@@ ose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wr@@ ath brings forth stri@@ fe . "
it is not for kings , L@@ em@@ uel ; it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for pr@@ inces to say , ' W@@ here is strong drink ? '
lest they drink , and forget the law , and per@@ ver@@ t the justice due to anyone who is aff@@ lic@@ ted .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continu@@ ally as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full . to the place where the rivers flow , there they flow again .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wis@@ dom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and be@@ hold , all is van@@ ity and a ch@@ asing after wind .
that which is cro@@ oked can '@@ t be made stra@@ ight ; and that which is lacking can '@@ t be counted .
therefore I began to cause my heart to desp@@ air concerning all the la@@ bor in which I had la@@ bo@@ red under the sun .
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to p@@ lu@@ ck up that which is plan@@ ted ;
I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess was there ; and in the place of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess was there .
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes up@@ ward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes down@@ ward to the ear@@ th ? "
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the ev@@ il work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but wo@@ e to him who is alone when he falls , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have another to lift him up .
I saw all the living who walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the other , who succeeded him .
guard your steps when you go to God 's house ; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fo@@ ols , for they don '@@ t know that they do ev@@ il .
D@@ on '@@ t be ras@@ h with your m@@ outh , and don '@@ t let your heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter anything before God ; for God is in heav@@ en , and you on ear@@ th . therefore let your words be few .
for as a dream comes with a multi@@ tude of car@@ es , so a fo@@ ol 's speech with a multi@@ tude of words .
when you vo@@ w a vo@@ w to God , don '@@ t def@@ er to pay it ; for he has no pleas@@ ure in fo@@ ols . pay that which you vo@@ w .
D@@ on '@@ t allow your m@@ outh to lead you into sin . D@@ on '@@ t protest before the mes@@ sen@@ ger that this was a mistake . why should God be angry at your voice , and destroy the work of your hands ?
when goods increase , those who eat them are increased ; and what advantage is there to its owner , except to feast on them with his eyes ?
the sle@@ ep of a labor@@ ing man is swe@@ et , whether he e@@ ats little or much ; but the ab@@ und@@ ance of the rich will not allow him to sle@@ ep .
this also is a gri@@ ev@@ ous ev@@ il , that in all points as he came , so shall he go . and what profit does he have who la@@ b@@ ors for the wind ?
for what advantage has the wise more than the fo@@ ol ? what has the poor man , that knows how to walk before the living ?
whatever has been , its name was given long ago ; and it is known what man is ; neither can he conten@@ d with him who is m@@ igh@@ ti@@ er than he .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fo@@ ols is in the house of mir@@ th .
it is better to hear the re@@ bu@@ ke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fo@@ ols .
D@@ on '@@ t be has@@ ty in your spirit to be angry , for an@@ ger rests in the bos@@ om of fo@@ ols .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , and in the day of ad@@ versity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
all this have I seen in my days of van@@ ity : there is a righ@@ te@@ ous man who per@@ is@@ hes in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and there is a w@@ ic@@ ked man who lives long in his ev@@ il@@ doing .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don '@@ t withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wis@@ dom and the scheme of things , and to know that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is st@@ up@@ idity , and that fo@@ ol@@ ishness is mad@@ ness .
which my sou@@ l still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpre@@ tation of a thing ? a man 's wis@@ dom makes his face sh@@ ine , and the hard@@ ness of his face is changed .
for he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know that which will be ; for who can tell him how it will be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
so I saw the w@@ ic@@ ked buried . indeed they came also from hol@@ iness . they went and were forgotten in the city where they did this . this also is van@@ ity .
because sentence against an ev@@ il work is not executed spe@@ edil@@ y , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do ev@@ il .
though a sin@@ ner comm@@ its crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet su@@ rely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are rever@@ ent before him .
but it shall not be well with the w@@ ic@@ ked , neither shall he leng@@ then days like a shadow ; because he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fear God .
when I applied my heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done on the ear@@ th ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sle@@ ep with his eyes ) ,
for the living know that they will die , but the dead don '@@ t know anything , neither do they have any more a reward ; for their memory is forgotten .
also their love , their hatred , and their en@@ v@@ y has per@@ ished long ago ; neither have they any more a portion fore@@ ver in anything that is done under the sun .
whatever your hand finds to do , do it with your might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wis@@ dom , in She@@ ol , where you are going .
yes also , when the fo@@ ol walk@@ s by the way , his understanding fails him , and he says to everyone that he is a fo@@ ol .
he who di@@ gs a p@@ it may fall into it ; and who@@ ever breaks through a wall may be bit@@ ten by a sn@@ ake .
the beginning of the words of his m@@ outh is fo@@ ol@@ ishness ; and the end of his talk is mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous mad@@ ness .
happy are you , land , when your king is the son of no@@ bles , and your pr@@ inces eat in due season , for strength , and not for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness !
D@@ on '@@ t cur@@ se the king , no , not in your th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and don '@@ t cur@@ se the rich in your bed@@ room : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has w@@ ings may tell the matter .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the ear@@ th ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
he who obser@@ ves the wind won '@@ t so@@ w ; and he who regards the cl@@ ou@@ ds won '@@ t re@@ ap .
in the morning so@@ w your se@@ ed , and in the evening don '@@ t with@@ hold your hand ; for you don '@@ t know which will prosp@@ er , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
truly the light is swe@@ et , and a pleas@@ ant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun .
yes , if a man lives many years , let him re@@ jo@@ ice in them all ; but let him remember the days of d@@ ark@@ ness , for they shall be many . all that comes is van@@ ity .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
before the silver cor@@ d is sever@@ ed , or the golden bo@@ w@@ l is broken , or the pit@@ cher is broken at the spring , or the whe@@ el broken at the c@@ ister@@ n ,
D@@ on '@@ t st@@ are at me because I am dark , because the sun has scor@@ ched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards . I ha@@ ven '@@ t kept my own v@@ ine@@ yard .
if you don '@@ t know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the she@@ ep . Gra@@ ze your young go@@ ats bes@@ ide the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds ' ten@@ ts .
as the app@@ le tree among the trees of the wood , so is my bel@@ ov@@ ed among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great de@@ light , his fruit was swe@@ et to my tas@@ te .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed is like a ro@@ e or a young har@@ t . be@@ hold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he g@@ lan@@ ces through the lat@@ tice .
my bel@@ ov@@ ed spoke , and said to me , " R@@ ise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
the flowers appear on the ear@@ th . the time of the singing has come , and the voice of the tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve is heard in our land .
the fi@@ g tree ri@@ pen@@ s her green fig@@ s . the v@@ ines are in b@@ los@@ so@@ m . they give forth their fra@@ gr@@ ance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " L@@ over
my do@@ ve in the cle@@ fts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountain@@ side , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is swe@@ et , and your face is lov@@ ely .
by night on my bed , I sought him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I sought him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the s@@ quar@@ es I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I sought him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him .
he made its pil@@ lars of silver , its bottom of gold , its seat of pur@@ ple , its mid@@ st being paved with love , from the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Jer@@ usalem .
go forth , you da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and see king Solomon , with the cro@@ wn with which his mother has crow@@ ned him , in the day of his w@@ ed@@ dings , in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart . L@@ over
your te@@ eth are like a newly shor@@ n flock , which have come up from the w@@ ashing , where every one of them has tw@@ ins . none is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed among them .
until the day is co@@ ol , and the shad@@ o@@ ws flee away , I will go to the mountain of m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , to the hill of fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
you have ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart , my sister , my bri@@ de . you have ra@@ vis@@ hed my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your nec@@ k .
how beautiful is your love , my sister , my bri@@ de ! how much better is your love than wine ! the fra@@ gr@@ ance of your per@@ fu@@ mes than all kinds of sp@@ ices !
your li@@ ps , my bri@@ de , dri@@ p like the hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b . hon@@ ey and milk are under your ton@@ gue . the s@@ me@@ ll of your gar@@ ments is like the s@@ me@@ ll of Lebanon .
I have taken off my ro@@ be . indeed , must I put it on ? I have was@@ hed my feet . indeed , must I soil them ?
I rose up to open for my bel@@ ov@@ ed . my hands dri@@ pped with m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , my fin@@ gers with liqu@@ id m@@ yr@@ r@@ h , on the hand@@ les of the lock .
the watch@@ men who go about the city found me . they beat me . they bru@@ ised me . the ke@@ epers of the walls took my clo@@ ak away from me .
how is your bel@@ ov@@ ed better than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , you fa@@ i@@ rest among women ? how is your bel@@ ov@@ ed better than another bel@@ ov@@ ed , that you do so adj@@ ure us ? bel@@ ov@@ ed
my bel@@ ov@@ ed has gone down to his gar@@ den , to the beds of sp@@ ices , to fe@@ ed in the gar@@ den@@ s , and to gather l@@ ilies .
turn away your eyes from me , for they have overcome me . your ha@@ ir is like a flock of go@@ ats , that lie along the side of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
I went down into the n@@ ut tree gro@@ ve , to see the green plants of the val@@ ley , to see whether the v@@ ine bud@@ ded , and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were in f@@ lower .
how beautiful are your feet in sand@@ als , pr@@ ince 's daughter ! your ro@@ unded th@@ igh@@ s are like je@@ wel@@ s , the work of the hands of a s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful work@@ man .
O@@ h that you were like my brother , who nur@@ sed from the bre@@ asts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would k@@ is@@ s you ; yes , and no one would desp@@ ise me .
I would lead you , bringing you into my mother 's house , who would instruc@@ t me . I would have you drink sp@@ ic@@ ed wine , of the ju@@ ice of my po@@ me@@ gran@@ ate .
who is this who comes up from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , le@@ an@@ ing on her bel@@ ov@@ ed ? under the app@@ le tree I ar@@ o@@ used you . there your mother conce@@ ived you . there she was in la@@ bor and b@@ ore you .
many waters can '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch love , neither can floods dro@@ wn it . if a man would give all the wealth of his house for love , he would be ut@@ ter@@ ly scor@@ ned . friends
we have a little sister . she has no bre@@ asts . what shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for ?
the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , which he saw concerning Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it : wounds , wel@@ ts , and open so@@ res . they ha@@ ven '@@ t been closed , neither ban@@ da@@ ged , neither so@@ o@@ th@@ ed with oil .
your country is de@@ so@@ late . your cities are burned with fire . S@@ tran@@ gers dev@@ our your land in your presence , and it is de@@ so@@ late , as over@@ thrown by st@@ ran@@ gers .
the daughter of Z@@ ion is left like a shelter in a v@@ ine@@ yard , like a h@@ ut in a field of mel@@ ons , like a bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed city .
unless Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies had left to us a very small re@@ mn@@ ant , we would have been as So@@ dom ; we would have been like G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h .
when you come to appear before me , who has required this at your hand , to tr@@ amp@@ le my courts ?
was@@ h yo@@ ur@@ selves , make yo@@ ur@@ self clean . put away the ev@@ il of your do@@ ings from before my eyes . ce@@ ase to do ev@@ il .
your pr@@ inces are rebel@@ li@@ ous , and compan@@ ions of th@@ i@@ ev@@ es . everyone lov@@ es bribes , and follows after re@@ wards . they don '@@ t judge the fa@@ ther@@ less , neither does the cause of the wi@@ dow come to them .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow to it .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots .
their land also is full of id@@ ols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fin@@ gers have made .
enter into the rock , and hide in the d@@ ust , from before the terror of Yah@@ we@@ h , and from the gl@@ ory of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
the lo@@ f@@ ty looks of man will be brought low , the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men will be bo@@ wed down , and Yah@@ we@@ h alone will be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
for there will be a day of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies for all that is proud and ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess of man shall be bo@@ wed down , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of men shall be brought low ; and Yah@@ we@@ h alone shall be ex@@ al@@ ted in that day .
the people will be op@@ pressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neigh@@ bor . the child will be@@ have himself pro@@ u@@ dly against the old man , and the base against the hon@@ or@@ able .
indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father , saying , " You have clo@@ thing , you be our ru@@ ler , and let this ru@@ in be under your hand . "
Wo@@ e to the w@@ ic@@ ked ! disaster is upon them ; for the de@@ eds of his hands will be paid back to him .
moreover Yah@@ we@@ h said , " Bec@@ ause the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion are ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and walk with out@@ stret@@ ched nec@@ ks and f@@ li@@ r@@ ting eyes , walk@@ ing to trip as they go , j@@ ing@@ ling or@@ nam@@ ents on their feet ;
therefore the Lord brings so@@ res on the cro@@ wn of the head of the women of Z@@ ion , and Yah@@ we@@ h will make their scal@@ ps bal@@ d . "
it will happen , that he who is left in Z@@ ion , and he who remains in Jer@@ usalem , shall be called hol@@ y , even everyone who is written among the living in Jer@@ usalem ;
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from its mid@@ st , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grap@@ es , did it yield wild grap@@ es ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard . I will take away its h@@ edge , and it will be e@@ aten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tr@@ amp@@ led down .
Wo@@ e to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to d@@ well alone in the mid@@ st of the land !
Wo@@ e to those who rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; who stay late into the night , until wine inf@@ la@@ mes them !
the har@@ p , Ly@@ re , tam@@ bour@@ ine , and fl@@ ute , with wine , are at their fe@@ asts ; but they don '@@ t respect the work of Yah@@ we@@ h , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
therefore She@@ ol has en@@ lar@@ ged its desire , and opened its m@@ outh without measure ; and their gl@@ ory , their multi@@ tude , their pom@@ p , and he who re@@ jo@@ ices among them , des@@ cen@@ d into it .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him has@@ ten his work , that we may see it ; and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
he will lift up a ban@@ ner to the nations from far , and he will wh@@ ist@@ le for them from the end of the ear@@ th . be@@ hold , they will come spe@@ edil@@ y and swi@@ f@@ tly .
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the bel@@ t of their wa@@ ist be un@@ tied , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
they will ro@@ ar against them in that day like the ro@@ aring of the sea . if one looks to the land be@@ hold , d@@ ark@@ ness and dist@@ ress . the light is dar@@ ken@@ ed in its cl@@ ou@@ ds .
the foundations of the th@@ res@@ holds sho@@ ok at the voice of him who called , and the house was filled with smoke .
then one of the ser@@ ap@@ him fle@@ w to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the ton@@ gs from off the alt@@ ar .
he touched my m@@ outh with it , and said , " be@@ hold , this has touched your li@@ ps ; and your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is taken away , and your sin for@@ given . "
and Yah@@ we@@ h has removed men far away , and the for@@ sak@@ en places are many in the mid@@ st of the land .
" let 's go up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its mid@@ st , even the son of T@@ ab@@ e@@ el . "
and the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is Samar@@ ia , and the head of Samar@@ ia is Rem@@ ali@@ ah 's son . if you will not believe , su@@ rely you shall not be established . ' "
Yah@@ we@@ h will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im depar@@ ted from Ju@@ da@@ h ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
it will happen in that day that Yah@@ we@@ h will wh@@ ist@@ le for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
they shall come , and shall all rest in the de@@ so@@ late val@@ ley@@ s , in the cle@@ fts of the ro@@ cks , on all Th@@ or@@ n h@@ ed@@ ges , and on all pas@@ tures .
in that day the Lord will s@@ have with a ra@@ zor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head and the ha@@ ir of the feet ; and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two she@@ ep ;
it will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand silver sh@@ ek@@ els , shall be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
all the hil@@ ls that were cultiv@@ ated with the ho@@ e , you shall not come there for fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of she@@ ep . "
now therefore , be@@ hold , the Lord brings upon them the m@@ igh@@ ty flood waters of the River : the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a and all his gl@@ ory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
take coun@@ sel together , and it will be brought to nothing ; speak the word , and it will not stand : for God is with us . "
for Yah@@ we@@ h spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and instruc@@ ted me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
" D@@ on '@@ t say , ' A con@@ spir@@ acy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A con@@ spir@@ acy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terror@@ ized .
Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is who you must respect as hol@@ y . he is the one you must fear . he is the one you must dre@@ ad .
I will wait for Yah@@ we@@ h , who hi@@ des his face from the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and I will look for him .
be@@ hold , I and the children whom Yah@@ we@@ h has given me are for signs and for won@@ ders in Israel from Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who d@@ wel@@ ls in Mount Z@@ ion .
they will pass through it , very dist@@ ressed and hun@@ gry ; and it will happen that when they are hun@@ gry , they will worry , and cur@@ se by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces up@@ ward ,
the people who walked in d@@ ark@@ ness have seen a great light . those who lived in the land of the shadow of death , on them the light has sh@@ ined .
for all the arm@@ or of the armed man in the no@@ is@@ y battle , and the gar@@ ments rol@@ led in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
through the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the land is bur@@ n@@ t up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one spar@@ es his brother .
Wo@@ e to those who decree un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous decre@@ es , and to the writers who write op@@ pres@@ sive decre@@ es ;
what will you do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which will come from af@@ ar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
therefore the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , will send among his f@@ at ones le@@ ann@@ ess ; and under his gl@@ ory a burning will be kin@@ d@@ led like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a fla@@ me ; and it will bur@@ n and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day .
he will consum@@ e the gl@@ ory of his forest , and of his fruit@@ ful field , both sou@@ l and body . it will be as when a standard be@@ ar@@ er fa@@ ints .
for yet a very little while , and the in@@ dign@@ ation against you will be accomplished , and my an@@ ger will be directed to his destruction . "
it will happen in that day , that his burden will de@@ part from off your sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h will rest on him : the spirit of wis@@ dom and understanding , the spirit of coun@@ sel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h .
his de@@ light will be in the fear of Yah@@ we@@ h . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his e@@ ars ;
the w@@ ol@@ f will live with the lam@@ b , and the Le@@ op@@ ard will lie down with the young go@@ at ; The cal@@ f , the young lion , and the f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f together ; and a little child will lead them .
it will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of J@@ es@@ se , who stands as a ban@@ ner of the peoples ; and his resting place will be g@@ lor@@ ious .
he will set up a ban@@ ner for the nations , and will assem@@ ble the out@@ casts of Israel , and gather together the disper@@ sed of Ju@@ da@@ h from the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th .
the en@@ v@@ y also of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will de@@ part , and those who persec@@ ute Ju@@ da@@ h will be cut off . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im won '@@ t en@@ v@@ y Ju@@ da@@ h , and Ju@@ da@@ h won '@@ t persec@@ ute E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
be@@ hold , God is my sal@@ vation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Y@@ ah , Yah@@ we@@ h , is my strength and song ; and he has become my sal@@ vation . "
set up a ban@@ ner on the b@@ are mountain ! lift up your voice to them ! wave your hand , that they may go into the gates of the no@@ bles .
I have comman@@ ded my consec@@ rated ones ; yes , I have called my m@@ igh@@ ty men for my an@@ ger , even my pro@@ u@@ dly ex@@ ulting ones .
the no@@ ise of a multi@@ tude is in the mountains , as of a great people ; the no@@ ise of an u@@ pro@@ ar of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the nations gathered together ! Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is mu@@ ster@@ ing the army for the battle .
they come from a far country , from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of heav@@ en , even Yah@@ we@@ h , and the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation , to destroy the whole land .
be@@ hold , the day of Yah@@ we@@ h comes , cru@@ el , with wr@@ ath and fierce an@@ ger ; to make the land a de@@ so@@ lation , and to destroy its sin@@ ners out of it .
for the stars of the sky and its con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations will not give their light . the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to sh@@ ine .
I will punish the world for their ev@@ il , and the w@@ ic@@ ked for their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . I will cause the ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance of the proud to ce@@ ase , and will hum@@ ble the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
therefore I will make the heav@@ ens tre@@ m@@ ble , and the ear@@ th will be shaken out of its place in the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , and in the day of his fierce an@@ ger .
it will happen that like a hun@@ ted gaz@@ elle , and like she@@ ep that no one ga@@ thers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their inf@@ ants also will be d@@ ashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be r@@ ans@@ acked , and their wi@@ ves ra@@ ped .
be@@ hold , I will stir up the Me@@ des against them , who will not value silver , and as for gold , they will not de@@ light in it .
their bo@@ ws will d@@ ash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b . their eyes will not spar@@ e children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Ara@@ bi@@ an will not pit@@ ch a tent there , neither will she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds make their f@@ loc@@ ks lie down there .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will have comp@@ as@@ sion on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreig@@ ner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
it will happen in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h will give you rest from your sor@@ row , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
your pom@@ p is brought down to She@@ ol , with the sound of your str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . Mag@@ go@@ ts are spread out under you , and wor@@ ms cover you .
you said in your heart , " I will as@@ cen@@ d into heav@@ en ! I will ex@@ alt my th@@ r@@ one above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
you will not join them in bur@@ ial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the se@@ ed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers will not be named fore@@ ver .
prepare for sla@@ ughter of his children because of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of their fa@@ thers , that they not rise up and poss@@ ess the ear@@ th , and fill the sur@@ face of the world with cities .
" I will also make it a possession for the por@@ c@@ up@@ ine , and po@@ ols of water . I will swe@@ ep it with the Bro@@ om of destruction , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies has sworn , saying , " su@@ rely , as I have thought , so shall it happen ; and as I have pur@@ posed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot on my mountains . then his yok@@ e will leave them , and his burden leave their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor will eat , and the ne@@ edy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with fam@@ ine , and your re@@ mn@@ ant will be killed .
they have gone up to Bay@@ ith , and to Di@@ bon , to the high places , to we@@ ep . Mo@@ a@@ b w@@ ails over N@@ eb@@ o and over M@@ ede@@ ba . Bal@@ d@@ ness is on all of their heads . every be@@ ard is cut off .
H@@ es@@ h@@ bon cri@@ es out with Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h . their voice is heard even to Ja@@ haz . therefore the armed men of Mo@@ a@@ b cry al@@ oud . their so@@ ul@@ s tre@@ m@@ ble within them .
my heart cri@@ es out for Mo@@ a@@ b ! her no@@ bles flee to Zo@@ ar , to Eg@@ la@@ th S@@ hel@@ ish@@ iy@@ ah ; for they go up by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim will be de@@ so@@ late ; for the gr@@ ass has with@@ ered away , the tender gr@@ ass fails , there is no green thing .
therefore they will carry away the ab@@ und@@ ance they have gotten , and that which they have stored up , over the Bro@@ ok of the w@@ il@@ lows .
for it will be that as w@@ and@@ ering birds , as a sc@@ at@@ tered n@@ est , so will the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Mo@@ a@@ b be at the for@@ ds of the Ar@@ non .
a th@@ r@@ one will be established in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , jud@@ ging , seeking justice , and swift to do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b , that he is very proud ; even of his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , his pride , and his wr@@ ath . his bo@@ ast@@ ings are nothing .
therefore I will we@@ ep with the we@@ eping of Jaz@@ er for the v@@ ine of Si@@ b@@ ma@@ h . I will water you with my te@@ ars , H@@ es@@ h@@ bon , and Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h : for on your summer fru@@ its and on your har@@ v@@ est the battle sh@@ out has fallen .
it will happen that when Mo@@ a@@ b presents himself , when he we@@ aries himself on the high place , and comes to his sanc@@ tu@@ ary to pra@@ y , that he will not prev@@ ail .
the cities of A@@ ro@@ er are for@@ sak@@ en . they will be for f@@ loc@@ ks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress shall ce@@ ase from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the k@@ ing@@ dom from Dam@@ as@@ cus , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Syria . they will be as the gl@@ ory of the children of Israel , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
" it will happen in that day that the gl@@ ory of Jac@@ o@@ b will be made th@@ in , and the fat@@ ness of his f@@ les@@ h will become le@@ an .
it will be like when the har@@ ves@@ ter ga@@ thers the wheat , and his arm re@@ aps the gra@@ in . yes , it will be like when one g@@ le@@ ans gra@@ in in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
in that day , people will look to their Mak@@ er , and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel .
they will not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fin@@ gers have made , either the Ash@@ er@@ im , or the incen@@ se al@@ tar@@ s .
in the day of your plan@@ ting , you h@@ edge it in . in the morning , you make your se@@ ed b@@ los@@ so@@ m , but the har@@ v@@ est fle@@ es away in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
A@@ h , the u@@ pro@@ ar of many peoples , who ro@@ ar like the ro@@ aring of the seas ; and the rus@@ hing of nations , that rush like the rus@@ hing of m@@ igh@@ ty waters !
at evening , be@@ hold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who pl@@ under us , and the lot of those who ro@@ b us .
all you inhabitants of the world , and you d@@ wel@@ lers on the ear@@ th , when a ban@@ ner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the tr@@ ump@@ et is blo@@ wn , listen !
for before the har@@ v@@ est , when the b@@ los@@ so@@ m is over , and the f@@ lower becomes a ri@@ pen@@ ing gra@@ pe , he will cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its mid@@ st . I will destroy its coun@@ sel . they will seek the id@@ ols , the char@@ mers , those who have familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards .
the rivers will become f@@ oul . the stre@@ ams of Egypt will be dimin@@ ished and dri@@ ed up . the re@@ eds and flags will wi@@ ther away .
the pr@@ inces of Zo@@ an have become fo@@ ols . the pr@@ inces of Mem@@ p@@ his are dec@@ e@@ ived . they have caused Egypt to go as@@ tra@@ y , who are the cor@@ ner@@ stone of her tri@@ bes .
Yah@@ we@@ h has mixed a spirit of per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess in the mid@@ st of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go as@@ tra@@ y in all of its works , like a dr@@ un@@ ken man stag@@ gers in his v@@ om@@ it .
in that day the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will be like women . they will tre@@ m@@ ble and fear because of the shak@@ ing of the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , which he shakes over them .
the land of Ju@@ da@@ h will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , which he determin@@ es against it .
in that day , there will be an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h in the mid@@ st of the land of Egypt , and a pil@@ lar to Yah@@ we@@ h at its border .
in that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will worship with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans .
so the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a will lead away the cap@@ tives of Egypt and the ex@@ il@@ es of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , young and old , nak@@ ed and bar@@ e@@ fo@@ ot , and with but@@ to@@ cks uncovered , to the sh@@ ame of Egypt .
you are my th@@ res@@ hing , and the gra@@ in of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
for they fled away from the s@@ words , from the drawn s@@ word , from the b@@ ent bo@@ w , and from the heat of battle .
for the Lord said to me , " With@@ in a year , as a worker bound by contract would count it , all the gl@@ ory of K@@ ed@@ ar will fail ,
and the resi@@ due of the number of the ar@@ chers , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of the children of K@@ ed@@ ar , will be few ; for Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , has spoken it . "
he took away the covering of Ju@@ da@@ h ; and you looked in that day to the arm@@ or in the house of the forest .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and I will clo@@ the him with your ro@@ be , and strengthen him with your bel@@ t . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his sho@@ ul@@ der . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
I will fas@@ ten him like a na@@ il in a sure place . he will be for a th@@ r@@ one of gl@@ ory to his father 's house .
they will han@@ g on him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , every small ves@@ sel , from the c@@ ups even to all the pit@@ chers .
the burden of T@@ y@@ re . H@@ ow@@ l , you ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kit@@ tim it is revealed to them .
be still , you inhabitants of the coast , you whom the mer@@ chan@@ ts of S@@ id@@ on , that pass over the sea , have rep@@ len@@ ished .
he has stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms . Yah@@ we@@ h has ordered the destruction of Can@@ a@@ an 's stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds .
it will happen after the end of sev@@ enty years that Yah@@ we@@ h will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
for it will be so in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th among the peoples , as the shak@@ ing of an olive tree , as the g@@ le@@ an@@ ings when the vin@@ t@@ age is done .
the ear@@ th will stag@@ ger like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and will s@@ way back and forth like a ham@@ mo@@ ck . its dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
it shall happen in that day that Yah@@ we@@ h will punish the army of the high ones on high , and the kings of the ear@@ th on the ear@@ th .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
Yah@@ we@@ h , you are my God . I will ex@@ alt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done won@@ der@@ ful things , things planned long ago , in complete fa@@ ith@@ ful@@ ness and truth .
as the heat in a d@@ ry place will you bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers ; as the heat by the sha@@ de of a cl@@ oud , the song of the dre@@ aded ones will be brought low .
in this mountain , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies will make all peoples a feast of f@@ at things , a feast of choice win@@ es , of f@@ at things full of mar@@ row , of well refin@@ ed choice win@@ es .
for in this mountain the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h will rest . Mo@@ a@@ b will be tro@@ dden down in his place , even like stra@@ w is tro@@ dden down in the water of the d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
he will spread out his hands in its mid@@ st , like one who sw@@ ims sp@@ reads out hands to sw@@ im , but his pride will be hum@@ b@@ led together with the craft of his hands .
he has brought the high fortress of your walls down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the d@@ ust .
for he has brought down those who d@@ well on high , the lo@@ f@@ ty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the d@@ ust .
yes , in the way of your judg@@ ments , Yah@@ we@@ h , have we w@@ aited for you . your name and your ren@@ own are the desire of our sou@@ l .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly ; for when your judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
let fav@@ or be shown to the w@@ ic@@ ked , yet he will not learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness . in the land of u@@ pri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness he will deal wrong@@ fully , and will not see Yah@@ we@@ h 's maj@@ es@@ ty .
like as a woman with child , who draws near the time of her delivery , is in p@@ ain and cri@@ es out in her pan@@ gs ; so we have been before you , Yah@@ we@@ h .
come , my people , enter into your rooms , and shut your doors behind you . hide yo@@ ur@@ self for a little moment , until the in@@ dign@@ ation is past .
in days to come , Jac@@ o@@ b will take root . Israel will b@@ los@@ so@@ m and bu@@ d . they will fill the sur@@ face of the world with fruit .
in measure , when you send them away , you conten@@ d with them . he has removed them with his roug@@ h blast in the day of the east wind .
for the for@@ ti@@ fied city is sol@@ itary , a habi@@ tation de@@ ser@@ ted and for@@ sak@@ en , like the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . the cal@@ f will fe@@ ed there , and there he will lie down , and consum@@ e its branches .
it will happen in that day , that Yah@@ we@@ h will th@@ res@@ h from the flow@@ ing stream of the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates to the Bro@@ ok of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
Wo@@ e to the cro@@ wn of pride of the dr@@ un@@ kar@@ ds of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and to the f@@ ading f@@ lower of his g@@ lor@@ ious beauty , which is on the head of the fer@@ tile val@@ ley of those who are overcome with wine !
for the bed is too short to stretch out on , and the b@@ lan@@ ket is too narrow to wrap on@@ es@@ el@@ f in .
when he has lev@@ eled its sur@@ face , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he plant the d@@ ill , and sc@@ at@@ ter the cum@@ in se@@ ed , and put in the wheat in ro@@ ws , the bar@@ ley in the appointed place , and the sp@@ el@@ t in its place ?
for the d@@ ill are not th@@ res@@ hed with a sharp instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned over the cum@@ in ; but the d@@ ill is beaten out with a stick , and the cum@@ in with a ro@@ d .
bread fl@@ our must be ground ; so he will not always be th@@ res@@ hing it . although he dri@@ ves the whe@@ el of his th@@ res@@ hing c@@ art over it , his hor@@ ses don '@@ t gr@@ ind it .
I will en@@ camp against you all around you , and will lay siege against you with posted troops . I will raise siege works against you .
but the multi@@ tude of your fo@@ es will be like fine d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ru@@ th@@ less ones like c@@ haf@@ f that blo@@ ws away . yes , it will be in an in@@ stan@@ t , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
for Yah@@ we@@ h has p@@ oured out on you a spirit of deep sle@@ ep , and has closed your eyes , the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; and he has covered your heads , the se@@ ers .
Is@@ n '@@ t it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the de@@ af will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d will see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
the hum@@ ble also will increase their joy in Yah@@ we@@ h , and the poor among men will re@@ jo@@ ice in the Holy One of Israel .
therefore this in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall , s@@ wel@@ ling out in a high wall , whose breaking comes su@@ d@@ den@@ ly in an in@@ stan@@ t .
one thousand will flee at the threat of one . at the threat of five , you will flee until you are left like a be@@ ac@@ on on the top of a mountain , and like a ban@@ ner on a hill .
for the people will d@@ well in Z@@ ion at Jer@@ usalem . you will we@@ ep no more . he will su@@ rely be gr@@ ac@@ ious to you at the voice of your cry . when he he@@ ars you , he will answer you .
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your e@@ ars will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall def@@ ile the over@@ lay@@ ing of your en@@ gra@@ ved images of silver , and the pla@@ ting of your m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an un@@ clean thing . you shall tell it , " G@@ o away ! "
the ox@@ en likewise and the young don@@ ke@@ ys that ti@@ ll the ground will eat sav@@ ory pro@@ ven@@ der , which has been win@@ no@@ wed with the sh@@ ov@@ el and with the for@@ k .
there shall be bro@@ oks and stre@@ ams of water on every lo@@ f@@ ty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great sla@@ ughter , when the tow@@ ers fall .
be@@ hold , the name of Yah@@ we@@ h comes from far away , burning with his an@@ ger , and in th@@ ick rising smoke . his li@@ ps are full of in@@ dign@@ ation , and his ton@@ gue is as a dev@@ our@@ ing fire .
his bre@@ ath is as an over@@ flow@@ ing stream that reaches even to the nec@@ k , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of destruction ; and a bri@@ dle that leads to ru@@ in will be in the j@@ a@@ ws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y feast is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one goes with a fl@@ ute to come to Yah@@ we@@ h 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
every stro@@ ke of the ro@@ d of punishment , which Yah@@ we@@ h will lay on him , will be with the sound of tam@@ bour@@ ines and har@@ ps . he will fight with them in batt@@ les , br@@ and@@ ishing weapons .
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of those who work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
for in that day everyone shall cast away his id@@ ols of silver and his id@@ ols of gol@@ d@@ -@@ -@@ sin which your own hands have made for you .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a cover@@ t from the storm , as stre@@ ams of water in a d@@ ry place , as the sha@@ de of a large rock in a we@@ ary land .
the eyes of those who see will not be dim , and the e@@ ars of those who hear will listen .
at the no@@ ise of the Th@@ under , the peoples have fled . when you lift yo@@ ur@@ self up , the nations are sc@@ at@@ tered .
he will d@@ well on high . his place of defen@@ se will be the fortress of ro@@ cks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can '@@ t compre@@ hend , with a st@@ range language that you can '@@ t understand .
their sla@@ in will also be cast out , and the st@@ en@@ ch of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will mel@@ t in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dis@@ solved . the sky will be rol@@ led up like a s@@ cr@@ oll , and all its armies will fade away , as a le@@ af f@@ ades from off a v@@ ine or a fi@@ g tree .
the wild ox@@ en will come down with them , and the young bul@@ ls with the m@@ igh@@ ty bul@@ ls ; and their land will be dr@@ un@@ ken with blood , and their d@@ ust made gre@@ asy with f@@ at .
it won '@@ t be qu@@ en@@ ched night nor day . its smoke will go up fore@@ ver . from generation to generation , it will lie waste . no one will pass through it fore@@ ver and ever .
but the p@@ el@@ ic@@ an and the por@@ c@@ up@@ ine will poss@@ ess it . the ow@@ l and the ra@@ ven will d@@ well in it . he will stretch the line of conf@@ usion over it , and the Pl@@ um@@ b line of emp@@ tin@@ ess .
they shall call its no@@ bles to the k@@ ing@@ dom , but none shall be there ; and all its pr@@ inces shall be nothing .
thor@@ ns will come up in its pal@@ aces , net@@ t@@ les and th@@ ist@@ les in its for@@ t@@ resses ; and it will be a habi@@ tation of j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s , a court for os@@ tri@@ ches .
the wild animals of the de@@ sert will meet with the w@@ ol@@ ves , and the wild go@@ at will cry to his fellow . yes , the night cre@@ ature shall settle there , and shall find her@@ self a place of rest .
the ar@@ row sn@@ ake will make her n@@ est there , and lay , Hat@@ ch , and gather under her sha@@ de . yes , the ki@@ tes will be gathered there , every one with her M@@ ate .
it will b@@ los@@ so@@ m ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and re@@ jo@@ ice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's gl@@ ory Lebanon will be given to it , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of Car@@ mel and Shar@@ on . they will see Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of our God .
then the la@@ me man will le@@ ap like a de@@ er , and the ton@@ gue of the m@@ ute will sing ; for waters will break out in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and stre@@ ams in the de@@ sert .
now it happened in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , that Sen@@ n@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a attacked all of the for@@ ti@@ fied cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and captured them .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a sent R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jer@@ usalem to king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with a large army . he stood by the aqu@@ educ@@ t from the up@@ per pool in the ful@@ ler 's field highway .
I say that your coun@@ sel and strength for the war are only v@@ ain words . now in whom do you trust , that you have rebel@@ led against me ?
now therefore , ple@@ ase make a pledge to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and called out with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " He@@ ar the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a !
D@@ on '@@ t let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us . this city won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . " '
be@@ w@@ are lest H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah persuade you , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will deliver us . " have any of the go@@ ds of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ?
it happened , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
he heard news concerning Tir@@ hak@@ ah king of Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , " He has come out to fight against you . " when he heard it , he sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
" thus you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , " Jer@@ usalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them , which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , G@@ oz@@ an , Har@@ an , Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den who were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the mes@@ sen@@ gers and read it . then H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah went up to Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , and spread it before Yah@@ we@@ h .
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
whom have you de@@ fied and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med ? against whom have you ex@@ al@@ ted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
by the way that he came , by the same he shall return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out and struck one hundred and eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand men in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
" go , and tell H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , " I have heard your pray@@ er . I have seen your te@@ ars . be@@ hold , I will add fif@@ teen years to your life .
I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will defend this city .
this shall be the sign to you from Yah@@ we@@ h , that Yah@@ we@@ h will do this thing that he has spoken .
the writing of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , when he had been si@@ ck , and had recovered of his si@@ ck@@ ness .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the an@@ gu@@ ish of my sou@@ l .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great an@@ gu@@ ish , but you have in love for my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption ; for you have cast all my sin@@ s behind your back .
the living , the living , he shall praise you , as I do this day . the father shall make known your truth to the children .
Yah@@ we@@ h will save me . therefore we will sing my songs with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
now I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had said , " Let them take a c@@ ake of fig@@ s , and lay it for a poul@@ tice on the bo@@ il , and he shall rec@@ over . "
at that time , Mer@@ od@@ ach Bal@@ adan the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , sent letters and a present to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah ; for he heard that he had been si@@ ck , and had recovered .
'@@ Beh@@ old , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fa@@ thers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on . nothing will be left , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
'@@ They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on 's palace . ' "
" speak comfor@@ tably to Jer@@ usalem ; and call out to her that her war@@ fare is accomplished , that her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity is par@@ don@@ ed , that she has received of Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand double for all her sin@@ s . "
be@@ hold , the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will come as a m@@ igh@@ ty one , and his arm will rule for him . be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ compen@@ se before him .
he will fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d . he will gather the lam@@ bs in his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om . he will g@@ ently lead those who have their young .
who did he take coun@@ sel with , and who instruc@@ ted him , and ta@@ ught him in the path of justice , and ta@@ ught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
ha@@ ven '@@ t you known ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard , yet ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you been told from the beginning ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you understood from the foundations of the ear@@ th ?
it is he who s@@ its above the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and its inhabitants are like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; who stret@@ ches out the heav@@ ens like a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ reads them out like a tent to d@@ well in ;
they are plan@@ ted scar@@ c@@ ely . they are so@@ wn scar@@ c@@ ely . their stock has scar@@ c@@ ely taken root in the ground . he mer@@ ely blo@@ ws on them , and they wi@@ ther , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind takes them away as st@@ ub@@ ble .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you known ? ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard ? the ever@@ lasting God , Yah@@ we@@ h , The Cre@@ ator of the ends of the ear@@ th , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fa@@ int . he is@@ n '@@ t we@@ ary . his understanding is un@@ sear@@ cha@@ ble .
but those who wait for Yah@@ we@@ h will ren@@ ew their strength . they will mount up with w@@ ings like e@@ ag@@ les . they will run , and not be we@@ ary . they will walk , and not fa@@ int .
he pursu@@ es them , and passes by saf@@ ely , E@@ ven by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called from its cor@@ ners , and said to you , ' You are my ser@@ vant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
be@@ hold , all those who are incen@@ sed against you will be disappointed and con@@ founded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall per@@ ish .
you will seek them , and won '@@ t find them , even those who conten@@ d with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @@@ -@@ @ ex@@ istent thing .
for I , Yah@@ we@@ h your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . I will help you . '
you will win@@ now them , and the wind will carry them away , and the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind will sc@@ at@@ ter them . you will re@@ jo@@ ice in Yah@@ we@@ h . you will gl@@ ory in the Holy One of Israel .
I will open rivers on the b@@ are he@@ ights , and spr@@ ings in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s . I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
be@@ hold , you are of nothing , and your work is of nothing . he who choos@@ es you is an ab@@ omin@@ ation .
when I look , there is no man ; even among them there is no coun@@ sel@@ or who , when I ask of them , can answer a word .
" be@@ hold , my ser@@ vant , whom I up@@ hold ; my chosen , in whom my sou@@ l deli@@ gh@@ ts@@ -- I have put my Spiri@@ t on him . he will bring justice to the nations .
he will not sh@@ out , nor raise his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
he won '@@ t break a bru@@ ised Re@@ ed . he won '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch a di@@ mly burning w@@ ick . he will fa@@ ith@@ fully bring justice .
" I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have called you in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
let the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that K@@ ed@@ ar inhabi@@ ts . let the inhabitants of Sel@@ a sing . let them sh@@ out from the top of the mountains !
Yah@@ we@@ h will go out like a m@@ igh@@ ty man . he will stir up z@@ e@@ al like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will sh@@ out al@@ oud . he will triumph over his enem@@ ies .
I will destroy mountains and hil@@ ls , and d@@ ry up all their her@@ bs . I will make the rivers islands , and will d@@ ry up the po@@ ols .
who is there among you who will give e@@ ar to this ? who will listen and hear for the time to come ?
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not over@@ flow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and fla@@ me will not scor@@ ch you .
since you have been pre@@ ci@@ ous and hon@@ ored in my sight , and I have lov@@ ed you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your se@@ ed from the east , and gather you from the west .
I have declared , I have sav@@ ed , and I have shown ; and there was no st@@ range go@@ d among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " and I am God .
be@@ hold , I will do a new thing . it spr@@ ings forth now . D@@ on '@@ t you know it ? I will even make a way in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and rivers in the de@@ sert .
the animals of the field shall hon@@ or me , the j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s and the os@@ tri@@ ches ; because I give water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and rivers in the de@@ sert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your she@@ ep for bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings ; neither have you hon@@ ored me with your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es . I have not burdened you with offer@@ ings , nor we@@ ar@@ ied you with fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se .
you have bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , nor have you filled me with the f@@ at of your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; but you have burdened me with your sin@@ s . you have we@@ ar@@ ied me with your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
I , even I , am he who blo@@ ts out your trans@@ gres@@ sions for my own sake ; and I will not remember your sin@@ s .
for I will p@@ our water on him who is thir@@ st@@ y , and stre@@ ams on the d@@ ry ground . I will p@@ our my Spiri@@ t on your se@@ ed , and my b@@ les@@ sing on your off@@ spring :
this is what Yah@@ we@@ h , the King of Israel , and his Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , says : " I am the first , and I am the last ; and besides me there is no God .
be@@ hold , all his fel@@ lows will be disappointed ; and the work@@ men are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to sh@@ ame together .
the black@@ s@@ mit@@ h takes an ax@@ e , works in the co@@ als , fas@@ hi@@ ons it with ham@@ mers , and works it with his strong arm . he is hun@@ gry , and his strength fails ; he drin@@ ks no water , and is fa@@ int .
he cuts down c@@ ed@@ ars for himself , and takes the Cy@@ press and the o@@ ak , and strength@@ ens for himself one among the trees of the forest . he plants a f@@ ir tree , and the rain no@@ ur@@ is@@ hes it .
they don '@@ t know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can '@@ t see ; and their hear@@ ts , that they can '@@ t understand .
he fe@@ eds on ashes . a dec@@ e@@ ived heart has turned him aside ; and he can '@@ t deliver his sou@@ l , nor say , " Is@@ n '@@ t there a lie in my right hand ? "
I have blo@@ t@@ ted out , as a th@@ ick cl@@ oud , your trans@@ gres@@ sions , and , as a cl@@ oud , your sin@@ s . return to me , for I have re@@ deemed you .
" I will go before you , and make the roug@@ h places smooth . I will break the doors of br@@ ass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yah@@ we@@ h , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
for Jac@@ o@@ b my ser@@ vant 's sake , and Israel my chosen , I have called you by your name . I have sur@@ named you , though you have not known me .
I am Yah@@ we@@ h , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yah@@ we@@ h , and there is no one else .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , and his Mak@@ er : " you ask me about the things that are to come , concerning my sons , and you command me concerning the work of my hands !
I have made the ear@@ th , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens ; and I have comman@@ ded all their army .
they will be disappointed , yes , con@@ founded , all of them . those who are makers of id@@ ols will go into conf@@ usion together .
" assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their en@@ gra@@ ved image , and pra@@ y to a go@@ d that can '@@ t save .
I have sworn by myself , the word has gone out of my m@@ outh in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and will not return , that to me every k@@ ne@@ e shall bo@@ w , every ton@@ gue shall take an oath .
they will say of me , ' There is righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and strength only in Yah@@ we@@ h . ' " even to him shall men come ; and all those who were incen@@ sed against him shall be disappointed .
" listen to me , house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and all the re@@ mn@@ ant of the house of Israel , that have been bor@@ ne from their birth , that have been carried from the w@@ om@@ b ;
calling a ra@@ ven@@ ous bird from the east , the man of my coun@@ sel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have pur@@ posed , I will also do it .
your nak@@ edn@@ ess shall be uncovered , yes , your sh@@ ame shall be seen : I will take ven@@ ge@@ ance , and will spar@@ e no man . "
I was angry with my people , I prof@@ an@@ ed my inher@@ it@@ ance , and gave them into your hand : you showed them no mer@@ cy ; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yok@@ e .
you said , ' I shall be a mist@@ ress fore@@ ver ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have la@@ bo@@ red : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall w@@ ander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I showed them : su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I did them , and they happened .
they are created now , and not from of old ; and before this day you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear them ; lest you should say , ' be@@ hold , I knew them . '
for my name 's sake will I def@@ er my an@@ ger , and for my praise will I refrain for you , that I not cut you off .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the ear@@ th , and my right hand has spread out the heav@@ ens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
" assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Yah@@ we@@ h lov@@ es shall perform his pleas@@ ure on Bab@@ yl@@ on , and his arm shall be on the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
" come near to me and hear this : " from the beginning I have not spoken in secret ; from the time that it was , there am I@@ . " Now the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h has sent me , with his Spiri@@ t .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , your Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the Holy One of Israel : I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who teach@@ es you to profit , who leads you by the way that you should go .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t thir@@ st when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
they shall not hunger nor thir@@ st ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mer@@ cy on them will lead them , even by spr@@ ings of water he will guide them .
be@@ hold , these shall come from far ; and be@@ hold , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sin@@ im . "
" for , as for your waste and your de@@ so@@ late places , and your land that has been destroyed , su@@ rely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants , and those who sw@@ allowed you up shall be far away .
I gave my back to the stri@@ kers , and my che@@ eks to those who p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir ; I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hide my face from sh@@ ame and sp@@ it@@ ting .
he is near who justi@@ fies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my ad@@ versary ? let him come near to me .
be@@ hold , the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? be@@ hold , all they shall wa@@ x old as a gar@@ ment , the mo@@ th shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Yah@@ we@@ h , who obe@@ ys the voice of his ser@@ vant ? he who walk@@ s in d@@ ark@@ ness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , you who seek Yah@@ we@@ h : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the p@@ it you were du@@ g from .
look to Ab@@ ra@@ ham your father , and to Sar@@ ah who b@@ ore you ; for when he was but one I called him , and I b@@ les@@ sed him , and made him many .
" attend to me , my people ; and give e@@ ar to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is near , my sal@@ vation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
for the mo@@ th shall eat them up like a gar@@ ment , and the wor@@ m shall eat them like wo@@ ol ; but my righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall be fore@@ ver , and my sal@@ vation to all generations . "
Is@@ n '@@ t it you who dri@@ ed up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; who made the dep@@ ths of the sea a way for the re@@ deemed to pass over ?
the cap@@ tive ex@@ ile shall spe@@ edil@@ y be fre@@ ed ; and he shall not die and go down into the p@@ it , neither shall his bread fail .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
the voice of your watch@@ men ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Yah@@ we@@ h returns to Z@@ ion .
Yah@@ we@@ h has made b@@ are his hol@@ y arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the ear@@ th have seen the sal@@ vation of our God .
for you shall not go out in has@@ te , neither shall you go by flight : for Yah@@ we@@ h will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your re@@ ar guard .
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of d@@ ry ground . he has no good looks or maj@@ es@@ ty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
they made his grave with the w@@ ic@@ ked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any dec@@ e@@ it in his m@@ outh .
after the suffering of his sou@@ l , he will see the light and be satisfied . my righ@@ te@@ ous ser@@ vant will justify many by the knowledge of himself ; and he will bear their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
" en@@ large the place of your tent , and let them stretch forth the cur@@ tains of your habi@@ tations ; don '@@ t spar@@ e : leng@@ then your cor@@ ds , and strengthen your stakes .
for you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left ; and your se@@ ed shall poss@@ ess the nations , and make the de@@ so@@ late cities to be inhabited .
for the mountains may de@@ part , and the hil@@ ls be removed ; but my lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from you , neither shall my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace be removed , " says Yah@@ we@@ h who has mer@@ cy on you .
I will make your pin@@ n@@ ac@@ les of ru@@ bies , and your gates of S@@ park@@ ling je@@ wel@@ s , and all your walls of pre@@ ci@@ ous stones .
in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness you shall be established : you shall be far from op@@ pression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
let the w@@ ic@@ ked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous man his th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and let him return to Yah@@ we@@ h , and he will have mer@@ cy on him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly par@@ don .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t return there , but waters the ear@@ th , and makes it bring forth and bu@@ d , and gives se@@ ed to the so@@ wer and bread to the e@@ ater ;
b@@ les@@ sed is the man who does this , and the son of man who holds it fast ; who keeps the Sab@@ b@@ ath from prof@@ an@@ ing it , and keeps his hand from doing any ev@@ il . "
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; I will give them an ever@@ lasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Yah@@ we@@ h , to minister to him , and to love the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sab@@ b@@ ath from prof@@ an@@ ing it , and holds fast my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
yes , the do@@ gs are gre@@ edy , they can never have enough ; and these are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds who can '@@ t understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
you were we@@ ar@@ ied with the length of your way ; yet you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t say , ' It is in v@@ ain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you w@@ eren '@@ t fa@@ int .
for I will not conten@@ d fore@@ ver , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would fa@@ int before me , and the so@@ ul@@ s who I have made .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness was I angry , and struck him ; I hi@@ d myself and was angry ; and he went on back@@ sli@@ ding in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the li@@ ps : peace , peace , to him who is far off and to him who is near , " says Yah@@ we@@ h ; " and I will he@@ al them . "
" cry al@@ oud , don '@@ t spar@@ e , lift up your voice like a tr@@ ump@@ et , and declare to my people their dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and to the house of Jac@@ o@@ b their sin@@ s .
be@@ hold , you fast for stri@@ fe and contention , and to strike with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : you don '@@ t fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your he@@ aling shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y ; and your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before you ; the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be your re@@ ar guard .
and if you draw out your sou@@ l to the hun@@ gry , and satisfy the aff@@ lic@@ ted sou@@ l : then your light shall rise in d@@ ark@@ ness , and your ob@@ sc@@ urity be as the no@@ on@@ day ;
be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand is not shor@@ tened , that it can '@@ t save ; neither his e@@ ar heavy , that it can '@@ t hear :
but your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have separated between you and your God , and your sin@@ s have hidden his face from you , so that he will not hear .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
the way of peace they don '@@ t know ; and there is no justice in their go@@ ings : they have made them cro@@ oked p@@ aths ; who@@ ever goes there@@ in does not know peace .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the b@@ lin@@ d ; yes , we gro@@ pe as those who have no eyes : we st@@ um@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the tw@@ il@@ ight ; among those who are lu@@ st@@ y we are as dead men .
for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are multi@@ p@@ lied before you , and our sin@@ s testify against us ; for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are with us , and as for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , we know them :
yes , truth is lacking ; and he who de@@ parts from ev@@ il makes himself a pre@@ y . Yah@@ we@@ h saw it , and it disp@@ le@@ ased him that there was no justice .
he saw that there was no man , and won@@ dered that there was no inter@@ c@@ essor : therefore his own arm brought sal@@ vation to him ; and his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , it up@@ held him .
he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and a hel@@ met of sal@@ vation on his head ; and he put on gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a man@@ tle .
according to their de@@ eds , accor@@ d@@ ingly he will repay , wr@@ ath to his ad@@ vers@@ aries , re@@ compen@@ se to his enem@@ ies ; to the islands he will repay re@@ compen@@ se .
then you shall see and be radi@@ ant , and your heart shall th@@ r@@ ill and be en@@ lar@@ ged ; because the ab@@ und@@ ance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
" foreigners shall build up your walls , and their kings shall minister to you : for in my wr@@ ath I struck you , but in my fav@@ or have I had mer@@ cy on you .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nur@@ se from royal bre@@ asts ; and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , am your Sav@@ ior , and your Re@@ de@@ e@@ mer , the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light to you : but Yah@@ we@@ h will be to you an ever@@ lasting light , and your God your gl@@ ory .
your people also shall be all righ@@ te@@ ous ; they shall inher@@ it the land fore@@ ver , the branch of my plan@@ ting , the work of my hands , that I may be gl@@ ori@@ fied .
but you shall be named the pri@@ ests of Yah@@ we@@ h ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will bo@@ ast in their gl@@ ory .
instead of your sh@@ ame you shall have double ; and instead of dis@@ hon@@ or they shall re@@ jo@@ ice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall poss@@ ess double ; ever@@ lasting joy shall be to them .
their se@@ ed shall be known among the nations , and their off@@ spring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the se@@ ed which Yah@@ we@@ h has b@@ les@@ sed . "
for as the ear@@ th brings forth its bu@@ d , and as the gar@@ den causes the things that are so@@ wn in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will cause righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and her sal@@ vation as a lam@@ p that bur@@ ns .
the nations shall see your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and all kings your gl@@ ory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h shall name .
you shall also be a cro@@ wn of beauty in the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h , and a royal di@@ ade@@ m in the hand of your God .
be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h has proclaimed to the end of the ear@@ th , " S@@ ay to the daughter of Z@@ ion , ' be@@ hold , your sal@@ vation comes . be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ compen@@ se before him . ' "
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I won@@ dered that there was none to up@@ hold : therefore my own arm brought sal@@ vation to me ; and my wr@@ ath , it up@@ held me .
I tro@@ d down the peoples in my an@@ ger , and made them dr@@ un@@ k in my wr@@ ath , and I p@@ oured out their li@@ fe@@ blood on the ear@@ th . "
but they rebel@@ led , and gri@@ ev@@ ed his hol@@ y Spiri@@ t : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he himself fought against them .
as the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck that go down into the val@@ ley , the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yo@@ ur@@ self a g@@ lor@@ ious name .
look down from heav@@ en , and see from the habi@@ tation of your hol@@ iness and of your gl@@ ory : where are your z@@ e@@ al and your m@@ igh@@ ty acts ? the ye@@ ar@@ ning of your heart and your comp@@ as@@ sion is re@@ strained toward me .
when you did aw@@ es@@ ome things which we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t look for , you came down , the mountains qu@@ aked at your presence .
you meet him who re@@ jo@@ ices and works righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , those who remember you in your ways . be@@ hold , you were angry , and we sin@@ ned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be sav@@ ed ?
for we have all become as one who is un@@ clean , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is as a pollu@@ ted gar@@ ment : and we all fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , take us away .
but now , Yah@@ we@@ h , you are our F@@ ather ; we are the cla@@ y , and you our P@@ ot@@ ter ; and we all are the work of your hand .
" I am inqu@@ ired of by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ask ; I am found by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek me : I said , Se@@ e me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebel@@ li@@ ous people , who walk in a way that is not good , after their own th@@ ou@@ ghts ;
who sit among the graves , and lo@@ dge in the secret places ; who eat pi@@ g 's f@@ les@@ h , and bro@@ th of ab@@ omin@@ able things is in their vessels ;
I will bring forth a se@@ ed out of Jac@@ o@@ b , and out of Ju@@ da@@ h an inher@@ it@@ or of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inher@@ it it , and my servants shall d@@ well there .
Shar@@ on shall be a fold of f@@ loc@@ ks , and the val@@ ley of A@@ ch@@ or a place for her@@ ds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
but be you glad and re@@ jo@@ ice fore@@ ver in that which I create ; for , be@@ hold , I create Jer@@ usalem a re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing , and her people a joy .
I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of we@@ eping and the voice of cr@@ ying .
it shall happen that , before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , " He@@ av@@ en is my th@@ r@@ one , and the ear@@ th is my foot@@ st@@ ool : what kind of house will you build to me ? and what place shall be my rest ?
you will see it , and your heart shall re@@ jo@@ ice , and your b@@ ones shall flo@@ ur@@ ish like the tender gr@@ ass : and the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have in@@ dign@@ ation against his enem@@ ies .
for by fire will Yah@@ we@@ h exec@@ ute judgment , and by his s@@ word , on all f@@ les@@ h ; and the sla@@ in of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be many .
" for as the new heav@@ ens and the new ear@@ th , which I will make , shall remain before me , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " so your se@@ ed and your name shall remain .
the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , of the pri@@ ests who were in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came in the days of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the thir@@ teen@@ th year of his reign .
then Yah@@ we@@ h put forth his hand , and touched my m@@ outh ; and Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , " be@@ hold , I have put my words in your m@@ outh .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a bo@@ iling cal@@ dr@@ on ; and it is ti@@ pping away from the north . "
I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ ped the works of their own hands .
" you therefore put your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , arise , and speak to them all that I command you . D@@ on '@@ t be dis@@ may@@ ed at them , lest I dis@@ may you before them .
" for my people have committed two ev@@ ils : they have for@@ sak@@ en me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out c@@ ister@@ ns , broken c@@ ister@@ ns , that can hold no water .
" ha@@ ven '@@ t you proc@@ ured this to yo@@ ur@@ self , in that you have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h your God , when he led you by the way ?
as the th@@ i@@ ef is as@@ ha@@ med when he is found , so is the house of Israel as@@ ha@@ med ; they , their kings , their pr@@ inces , and their pri@@ ests , and their pro@@ ph@@ ets ;
" but where are your go@@ ds that you have made for yo@@ ur@@ selves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h .
" I have struck your children in v@@ ain . they received no correc@@ tion . your own s@@ word has dev@@ oured your pro@@ ph@@ ets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the so@@ ul@@ s of the innocent poor is found in your sk@@ ir@@ ts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . su@@ rely his an@@ ger has turned away from me . ' " be@@ hold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sin@@ ned . '
why do you go about so much to change your way ? you will be as@@ ha@@ med of Egypt also , as you were as@@ ha@@ med of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosp@@ er with them .
I said after she had done all these things , ' S@@ he will return to me ; ' but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return ; and her t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous sister Ju@@ da@@ h saw it .
it happened through the ligh@@ t@@ ness of her prostitution , that the land was pollu@@ ted , and she committed ad@@ ul@@ tery with stones and with sto@@ cks .
only acknowledge your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , that you have trans@@ g@@ ressed against Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and have sc@@ at@@ tered your ways to the st@@ ran@@ gers under every green tree , and you have not obe@@ yed my voice , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h . "
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inher@@ it@@ ance to your fa@@ thers .
a voice is heard on the b@@ are he@@ ights , the we@@ eping and the peti@@ tions of the children of Israel ; because they have per@@ ver@@ ted their way , they have forgotten Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
truly in v@@ ain is help from the hil@@ ls , the t@@ um@@ ult on the mountains . truly the sal@@ vation of Israel is in Yah@@ we@@ h our God .
and you shall swe@@ ar , ' As Yah@@ we@@ h lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness . the nations shall b@@ less themselves in him , and in him shall they gl@@ ory . "
be@@ hold , he shall come up as cl@@ ou@@ ds , and his char@@ i@@ ots shall be as the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind : his hor@@ ses are swi@@ f@@ ter than e@@ ag@@ les . Wo@@ e to us ! for we are ru@@ ined .
" for my people are fo@@ ol@@ ish , they don '@@ t know me . they are fo@@ ol@@ ish children , and they have no understanding . they are s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful in doing ev@@ il , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
every city fle@@ es for the no@@ ise of the hor@@ se@@ men and ar@@ chers ; they go into the th@@ ic@@ kets , and clim@@ b up on the ro@@ cks : every city is for@@ sak@@ en , and not a man d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in .
the pro@@ ph@@ ets shall become wind , and the word is not in them . thus shall it be done to them . "
she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds with their f@@ loc@@ ks shall come to her ; they shall pit@@ ch their ten@@ ts against her all around ; they shall fe@@ ed everyone in his place . "
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wi@@ ves together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Yah@@ we@@ h . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous@@ ness ; and from the pro@@ phe@@ t even to the pri@@ est , everyone deals fal@@ sely .
they have he@@ aled also the hurt of my people super@@ fic@@ ially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
hear , ear@@ th ! be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this people , even the fruit of their th@@ ou@@ ghts , because they have not list@@ ened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se from She@@ ba , and the swe@@ et can@@ e from a far country ? your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings are not acceptable , nor your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ple@@ asing to me . "
D@@ on '@@ t go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the s@@ word of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
for if you thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly amend your ways and your do@@ ings ; if you thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly exec@@ ute justice between a man and his neigh@@ bor ;
then will I cause you to d@@ well in this place , in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers , from of old even fore@@ ver@@ more .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of rob@@ bers in your eyes ? be@@ hold , I , even I , have seen it , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but go now to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , where I caused my name to d@@ well at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear ; and I called you , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer :
for I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak to your fa@@ thers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
you shall speak all these words to them ; but they will not listen to you : you shall also call to them ; but they will not answer you .
for the children of Ju@@ da@@ h have done that which is ev@@ il in my sight , says Yah@@ we@@ h : they have set their ab@@ omin@@ ations in the house which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky , and for the animals of the ear@@ th ; and none shall fri@@ gh@@ ten them away .
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due that remain of this ev@@ il family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
I list@@ ened and heard , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak ar@@ ight : no man re@@ pen@@ ts him of his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a hor@@ se that rus@@ hes head@@ long in the battle .
yes , the stor@@ k in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve and the sw@@ allow and the cr@@ ane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don '@@ t know Yah@@ we@@ h 's law .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dis@@ may@@ ed and taken : be@@ hold , they have rejected the word of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and what kind of wis@@ dom is in them ?
they have he@@ aled the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt : I mour@@ n ; dis@@ may has taken hold on me .
O@@ h that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of te@@ ars , that I might we@@ ep day and night for the sla@@ in of the daughter of my people !
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
they will dec@@ e@@ ive everyone his neigh@@ bor , and will not speak the truth : they have ta@@ ught their ton@@ gue to speak lies ; they we@@ ary themselves to commit in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
their ton@@ gue is a deadly ar@@ row ; it speaks dec@@ e@@ it : one speaks peac@@ e@@ ably to his neigh@@ bor with his m@@ outh , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , be@@ hold , I will fe@@ ed them , even this people , with wor@@ m@@ wood , and give them water of g@@ all to drink .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fa@@ thers have known ; and I will send the s@@ word after them , until I have consu@@ med them .
and let them make has@@ te , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with te@@ ars , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our pal@@ aces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the peoples are van@@ ity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man with the ax@@ e .
but Yah@@ we@@ h is the true God ; he is the living God , and an ever@@ lasting King : at his wr@@ ath the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ bles , and the nations are not able to with@@ stand his in@@ dign@@ ation .
he has made the ear@@ th by his power , he has established the world by his wis@@ dom , and by his understanding has he stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens :
every man has become bru@@ tish and without knowledge ; every gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h is disappointed by his en@@ gra@@ ved image ; for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the tri@@ be of his inher@@ it@@ ance : Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is his name .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds are become bru@@ tish , and have not inqu@@ ired of Yah@@ we@@ h : therefore they have not prosp@@ ered , and all their f@@ loc@@ ks are sc@@ at@@ tered .
the voice of news , be@@ hold , it comes , and a great commo@@ tion out of the north country , to make the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ wel@@ ling place of j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s .
then shall the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem go and cry to the go@@ ds to which they offer incen@@ se : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have you set up al@@ tar@@ s to the sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se to Ba@@ al .
Yah@@ we@@ h called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with good@@ ly fruit : with the no@@ ise of a great t@@ um@@ ult he has kin@@ d@@ led fire on it , and its branches are broken .
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , be@@ hold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the s@@ word ; their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters shall die by fam@@ ine ;
and there shall be no re@@ mn@@ ant to them : for I will bring ev@@ il on the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , even the year of their vis@@ itation .
you have plan@@ ted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their m@@ outh , and far from their heart .
but you , Yah@@ we@@ h , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like she@@ ep for the sla@@ ughter , and prepare them for the day of sla@@ ughter .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with you ; even they have cri@@ ed al@@ oud after you : D@@ on '@@ t believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
I have for@@ sak@@ en my house , I have cast off my heritage ; I have given the de@@ arly bel@@ ov@@ ed of my sou@@ l into the hand of her enem@@ ies .
they have made it a de@@ so@@ lation ; it mour@@ ns to me , being de@@ so@@ late ; the whole land is made de@@ so@@ late , because no man lays it to heart .
D@@ est@@ ro@@ yers have come on all the b@@ are he@@ ights in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; for the s@@ word of Yah@@ we@@ h dev@@ ours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h has peace .
it shall happen , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them up , I will return and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
take the bel@@ t that you have bought , which is on your wa@@ ist , and arise , go to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and hide it there in a cle@@ ft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Yah@@ we@@ h said to me , arise , go to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and take the bel@@ t from there , which I comman@@ ded you to hide there .
then I went to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and du@@ g , and took the bel@@ t from the place where I had hidden it ; and be@@ hold , the bel@@ t was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
but if you will not hear it , my sou@@ l shall we@@ ep in secret for your pride ; and my eye shall we@@ ep bit@@ ter@@ ly , and run down with te@@ ars , because Yah@@ we@@ h 's flock is taken cap@@ tive .
say to the king and to the qu@@ een mother , hum@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves , sit down ; for your he@@ addresses have come down , even the cro@@ wn of your gl@@ ory .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Ju@@ da@@ h is carried away cap@@ tive , all of it ; it is wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yo@@ ur@@ self ta@@ ught to be friends to you ? shall not sor@@ ro@@ ws take hold of you , as of a woman in trav@@ ail ?
if you say in your heart , Wh@@ y are these things come on me ? for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity are your sk@@ ir@@ ts uncovered , and your he@@ els suffer violence .
because of the ground which is cr@@ acked , because no rain has been in the land , the p@@ low@@ men are disappointed , they cover their heads .
I have win@@ no@@ wed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destro@@ yer at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused an@@ gu@@ ish and terr@@ ors to fall on her su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
your sub@@ stance and your treasures will I give for a sp@@ oil without price , and that for all your sin@@ s , even in all your borders .
I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sit in the assembly of those who make mer@@ ry , nor re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with in@@ dign@@ ation .
I will deliver you out of the hand of the w@@ ic@@ ked , and I will re@@ de@@ em you out of the hand of the ter@@ ri@@ ble .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who b@@ ore them , and concerning their fa@@ thers who became their father in this land :
and you have done ev@@ il more than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , you walk every one after the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of his ev@@ il heart , so that you don '@@ t listen to me :
for my eyes are on all their ways ; they are not hidden from my face , neither is their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity conce@@ aled from my eyes .
first I will re@@ compen@@ se their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin double , because they have pollu@@ ted my land with the car@@ c@@ ass@@ es of their de@@ te@@ stable things , and have filled my inher@@ it@@ ance with their ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore be@@ hold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Yah@@ we@@ h .
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is en@@ gra@@ ved on the tab@@ let of their heart , and on the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a salt land and not inhabited .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the hope of Israel , all who for@@ sake you shall be disappointed . those who de@@ part from me shall be written in the ear@@ th , because they have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h , the spring of living waters .
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day hol@@ y , neither do any work : but make the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , as I comman@@ ded your fa@@ thers .
then I went down to the P@@ ot@@ ter 's house , and be@@ hold , he was making a work on the whe@@ els .
when the ves@@ sel that he made of the cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter , he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
at what in@@ stan@@ t I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a k@@ ing@@ dom , to p@@ lu@@ ck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is ev@@ il in my sight , that they not obe@@ y my voice , then I will rep@@ ent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
for my people have forgotten me , they have burned incen@@ se to false go@@ ds ; and they have been made to st@@ um@@ ble in their ways , in the ancient p@@ aths , to walk in by@@ ways , in a way not built up ;
I will sc@@ at@@ ter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when you shall bring a troop su@@ d@@ den@@ ly on them ; for they have du@@ g a p@@ it to take me , and hi@@ d s@@ nar@@ es for my feet .
and go forth to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the gate Har@@ s@@ ith , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell you ;
then came Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Top@@ het@@ h , where Yah@@ we@@ h had sent him to pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ; and he stood in the court of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , and said to all the people :
now P@@ ash@@ hur , the son of Im@@ mer the pri@@ est , who was chief officer in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , heard Jerem@@ i@@ ah pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying these things .
then P@@ ash@@ hur struck Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the up@@ per gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
but , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , who tests the righ@@ te@@ ous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your ven@@ ge@@ ance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
Cur@@ sed is the day in which I was born : D@@ on '@@ t let the day in which my mother b@@ ore me be b@@ les@@ sed .
let that man be as the cities which Yah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent : and let him hear a cry in the morning , and sh@@ ou@@ ting at no@@ on@@ time ;
because he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t kill me from the w@@ om@@ b ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her w@@ om@@ b always great .
I myself will fight against you with an out@@ stret@@ ched hand and with a strong arm , even in an@@ ger , and in wr@@ ath , and in great in@@ dign@@ ation .
be@@ hold , I am against you , O inhabi@@ tant of the val@@ ley , and of the rock of the pla@@ in , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; you that say , Wh@@ o shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habi@@ tations ?
say , He@@ ar the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the th@@ r@@ one of David , ri@@ ding in char@@ i@@ ots and on hor@@ ses , he , and his servants , and his people .
Wo@@ e to him who buil@@ ds his house by un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , and his rooms by in@@ justice ; who uses his neigh@@ bor 's service without wages , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t give him his h@@ ire ;
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y my voice .
I will cast you out , and your mother who b@@ ore you , into another country , where you were not born ; and there you will die .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken ves@@ sel ? is he a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts ? why are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into the land which they don '@@ t know ?
I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and multi@@ ply .
I will set up she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds over them , who shall fe@@ ed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , neither shall any be lacking , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
in his days Ju@@ da@@ h shall be sav@@ ed , and Israel shall d@@ well saf@@ ely ; and this is his name by which he shall be called : Yah@@ we@@ h our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that they shall no more say , As Yah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets . my heart within me is broken , all my b@@ ones shake ; I am like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because of his hol@@ y words .
therefore their way shall be to them as sli@@ p@@ per@@ y places in the d@@ ark@@ ness : they shall be driven on , and fall there@@ in ; for I will bring ev@@ il on them , even the year of their vis@@ itation , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
they say continu@@ ally to those who desp@@ ise me , Yah@@ we@@ h has said , You shall have peace ; and to everyone who walk@@ s in the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of his own heart they say , No ev@@ il shall come on you .
for who has stood in the council of Yah@@ we@@ h , that he should perce@@ ive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
be@@ hold , the storm of Yah@@ we@@ h , his wr@@ ath , has gone forth . yes , a wh@@ ir@@ ling storm . it shall bur@@ st on the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
how long shall this be in the heart of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y lies , even the pro@@ ph@@ ets of the dec@@ e@@ it of their own heart ?
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dre@@ ams which they tell every man to his neigh@@ bor , as their fa@@ thers for@@ got my name for Ba@@ al .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , away from my presence :
one bas@@ ket had very good fig@@ s , like the fig@@ s that are first @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ pe ; and the other bas@@ ket had very bad fig@@ s , which could not be e@@ aten , they were so bad .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : like these good fig@@ s , so will I regard the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for good .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will send the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , among them , until they be consu@@ med from off the land that I gave to them and to their fa@@ thers .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h ( the same was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) ,
Yah@@ we@@ h has sent to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not list@@ ened , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear )
I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jerem@@ i@@ ah has pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against all the nations .
they shall drink , and reel back and forth , and be ma@@ d , because of the s@@ word that I will send among them .
then took I the c@@ up at Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Yah@@ we@@ h had sent me :
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and his servants , and his pr@@ inces , and all his people ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the U@@ z , and all the kings of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Gaza , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ;
and all the kings of T@@ y@@ re , and all the kings of S@@ id@@ on , and the kings of the is@@ le which is beyond the sea ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who d@@ well in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ;
and all the kings of Z@@ im@@ ri , and all the kings of E@@ lam , and all the kings of the Me@@ des ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the c@@ up at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : you shall su@@ rely drink .
W@@ ail , you she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and cry ; and w@@ allow in d@@ ust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your sla@@ ughter and of your disper@@ sions are fully come , and you shall fall like a good@@ ly ves@@ sel .
the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and the w@@ ailing of the principal of the flock ! for Yah@@ we@@ h lays waste their pas@@ ture .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , came this word from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
to listen to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not list@@ ened ;
then rose up certain of the el@@ ders of the land , and spoke to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
there was also a man who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , U@@ ri@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah of Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ; and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jerem@@ i@@ ah :
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king sent men into Egypt , El@@ na@@ than the son of A@@ ch@@ bor , and certain men with him , into Egypt ;
and they f@@ et@@ ched forth U@@ ri@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , who killed him with the s@@ word , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an was with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , came this word to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
I have made the ear@@ th , the men and the animals that are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his own land come : and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant .
for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should per@@ ish .
D@@ on '@@ t listen to the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; for they pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y a lie to you .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on took away from this place , and carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
then the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to the pro@@ phe@@ t Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah in the presence of the pri@@ ests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your e@@ ars , and in the e@@ ars of all the people :
then the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t had broken the bar from off the nec@@ k of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
( after that J@@ ec@@ on@@ i@@ ah the king , the qu@@ een mother , the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem , the craf@@ ts@@ men , and the S@@ mi@@ ths , had depar@@ ted from Jer@@ usalem ) ,
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) , saying ,
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , to all the cap@@ tivity , whom I have caused to be carried away cap@@ tive from Jer@@ usalem to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , After sev@@ enty years are accomplished for Bab@@ yl@@ on , I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies ; be@@ hold , I will send on them the s@@ word , the fam@@ ine , and the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , and will make them like v@@ ile fig@@ s , that can '@@ t be e@@ aten , they are so bad .
because they have not list@@ ened to my words , says Yah@@ we@@ h , with which I sent to them my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ; but you would not hear , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your p@@ ain is inc@@ ur@@ able : for the gre@@ at@@ ness of your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , because your sin@@ s were increased , I have done these things to you .
out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of those who make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
be@@ hold , the storm of Yah@@ we@@ h , his wr@@ ath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall bur@@ st on the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
the fierce an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the inten@@ tions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
I have su@@ rely heard E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im b@@ emo@@ an@@ ing himself thus , You have ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed me , and I was ch@@ as@@ ti@@ sed , as an un@@ trained cal@@ f : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Yah@@ we@@ h my God .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I struck on my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , yes , even con@@ founded , because I b@@ ore the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of animal .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to p@@ lu@@ ck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to aff@@ lic@@ t , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
in those days they shall say no more , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten s@@ our grap@@ es , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge .
but everyone shall die for his own in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : every man who e@@ ats the s@@ our grap@@ es , his te@@ eth shall be set on edge .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will make a new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Ju@@ da@@ h :
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h in the tenth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , which was the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
and he shall bring Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall be there until I visit him , says Yah@@ we@@ h : though you fight with the Chal@@ de@@ ans , you shall not prosp@@ er ?
so I took the de@@ ed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , containing the terms and conditions , and that which was open ;
A@@ h Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ! be@@ hold , you have made the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th by your great power and by your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness to thousands , and re@@ compen@@ se the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the fa@@ thers into the bos@@ om of their children after them ; the great , the m@@ igh@@ ty God , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is his name ;
who performed signs and won@@ ders in the land of Egypt , even to this day , both in Israel and among other men ; and made yo@@ ur@@ self a name , as in this day ;
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great terror ;
therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and he shall take it :
for this city has been to me a provoc@@ ation of my an@@ ger and of my wr@@ ath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
yes , I will re@@ jo@@ ice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assu@@ red@@ ly with my whole heart and with my whole sou@@ l .
moreover the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cause the cap@@ tivity of Ju@@ da@@ h and the cap@@ tivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a habi@@ tation of she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds causing their f@@ loc@@ ks to lie down .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
in those days shall Ju@@ da@@ h be sav@@ ed , and Jer@@ usalem shall d@@ well saf@@ ely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Yah@@ we@@ h our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
D@@ on '@@ t consider what this people has spoken , saying , The two families which Yah@@ we@@ h chose , he has cast them off ? thus do they desp@@ ise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people who were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty to them ;
that every man should let his male ser@@ vant , and every man his female ser@@ vant , who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w or a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bon@@ d@@ servants of them , of a J@@ ew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : I made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge , saying ,
the word which came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
then I took Ja@@ az@@ an@@ i@@ ah the son of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , the son of Hab@@ az@@ z@@ in@@ i@@ ah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rec@@ habi@@ tes ;
we have obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , our father , in all that he comman@@ ded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , or our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
but we have lived in ten@@ ts , and have obe@@ yed , and done according to all that Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b our father comman@@ ded us .
because the sons of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b have performed the comman@@ d@@ ment of their father which he comman@@ ded them , but this people has not list@@ ened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , that this word came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah ; and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book .
when Mic@@ ai@@ ah the son of G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , had heard out of the book all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
then Mic@@ ai@@ ah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Bar@@ u@@ ch read the book in the e@@ ars of the people .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Bar@@ u@@ ch , We will su@@ rely tell the king of all these words .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the s@@ cr@@ oll in the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be ; and they told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the bra@@ z@@ ier burning before him .
they were not afraid , nor t@@ ore their gar@@ ments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
moreover El@@ na@@ than and De@@ la@@ i@@ ah and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah had made inter@@ c@@ ession to the king that he would not bur@@ n the s@@ cr@@ oll ; but he would not hear them .
then the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , after that the king had burned the s@@ cr@@ oll , and the words which Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote at the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah , saying ,
take again another s@@ cr@@ oll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first s@@ cr@@ oll , which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king of Ju@@ da@@ h has burned .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah re@@ ig@@ ned as king , instead of Con@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on made king in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , list@@ ened to the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ing Jer@@ usalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jer@@ usalem .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
it happened that , when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jer@@ usalem for fear of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's army ,
the pr@@ inces were angry with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had come into the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on house , and into the cells , and Jerem@@ i@@ ah had remained there many days ;
where now are your pro@@ ph@@ ets who pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied to you , saying , The king of Bab@@ yl@@ on shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with the cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the guard .
then Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and the king said to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then you shall tell them , I presented my supp@@ lic@@ ation before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jon@@ athan 's house , to die there .
then came all the pr@@ inces to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had comman@@ ded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
in the ele@@ venth year of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
then the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in R@@ ib@@ lah before his eyes : also the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on killed all the no@@ bles of Ju@@ da@@ h .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and broke down the walls of Jer@@ usalem .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the resi@@ due of the people who remained in the city , the de@@ ser@@ ters also who fell away to him , and the resi@@ due of the people who remained .
but Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will su@@ rely save you , and you shall not fall by the s@@ word , but your life shall be for a pre@@ y to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven , and came to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and gathered wine and summer fru@@ its very much .
moreover Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were in the fields , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah to M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah ,
and said to him , D@@ o you know that Ba@@ al@@ is the king of the children of Am@@ mon has sent I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah to take your life ? but G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe them .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also killed all the Jews who were with him , with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were found there , the men of war .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah killed them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gi@@ be@@ on .
now it happened that , when all the people who were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people who I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el had carried away cap@@ tive from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah turned about and came back , and went to Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , of whom you are afraid ; don '@@ t be afraid of him , says Yah@@ we@@ h : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
now therefore hear the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , O re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h : thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to live there ;
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Yah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mort@@ ar in the bri@@ ck work , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity , and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
however I sent to you all my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them , saying , O@@ h , don '@@ t do this ab@@ omin@@ able thing that I h@@ ate .
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish those who d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ;
as for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , we will not listen to you .
but since we left off burning incen@@ se to the qu@@ een of the sky , and po@@ uring out drink offer@@ ings to her , we have wanted all things , and have been consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
be@@ hold , I watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good ; and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h who are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until they are all gone .
of Egypt : concerning the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h Nec@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
why have I seen it ? they are dis@@ may@@ ed and are turned back@@ ward ; and their m@@ igh@@ ty ones are beaten down , and have fled Ap@@ ace , and don '@@ t look back : terror is on every side , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
go up , you hor@@ ses ; and ra@@ ge , you char@@ i@@ ots ; and let the m@@ igh@@ ty men go forth : C@@ ush and P@@ ut , who handle the shield ; and the Lu@@ dim , who handle and b@@ end the bo@@ w .
the nations have heard of your sh@@ ame , and the ear@@ th is full of your cry ; for the m@@ igh@@ ty man has stumb@@ led against the m@@ igh@@ ty , they are fallen both of them together .
the word that Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , how that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on should come and strike the land of Egypt .
they cri@@ ed there , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt is but a no@@ ise ; he has let the appointed time pass by .
the sound of it shall go like the ser@@ p@@ ent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with ax@@ es , as wood cut@@ ters .
for by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with contin@@ ual we@@ eping shall they go up ; for at the des@@ cent of Hor@@ on@@ aim they have heard the dist@@ ress of the cry of destruction .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will send to him those who p@@ our off , and they shall p@@ our him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bott@@ les in pieces .
Mo@@ a@@ b is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the sla@@ ughter , says the King , whose name is Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
judgment has come on the pla@@ in country , on Hol@@ on , and on Jah@@ z@@ ah , and on M@@ ep@@ ha@@ ath ,
you inhabitants of Mo@@ a@@ b , leave the cities , and d@@ well in the rock ; and be like the do@@ ve that makes her n@@ est over the m@@ outh of the ab@@ y@@ ss .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ a@@ b . he is very proud ; his lo@@ f@@ tin@@ ess , and his pride , and his ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , and the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ tin@@ ess of his heart .
from the cry of H@@ es@@ h@@ bon even to Ele@@ al@@ e@@ h , even to Ja@@ haz have they ut@@ tered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even to Hor@@ on@@ aim , to Eg@@ la@@ th S@@ hel@@ ish@@ iy@@ ah : for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim also shall become de@@ so@@ late .
moreover I will cause to ce@@ ase in Mo@@ a@@ b , says Yah@@ we@@ h , him who offers in the high place , and him who bur@@ ns incen@@ se to his go@@ ds .
on all the hous@@ et@@ ops of Mo@@ a@@ b and in its streets there is lament@@ ation every where ; for I have broken Mo@@ a@@ b like a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th is taken , and the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds are seized , and the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of Mo@@ a@@ b at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
flee , turn back , d@@ well in the dep@@ ths , inhabitants of D@@ ed@@ an ; for I will bring the cal@@ am@@ ity of E@@ sa@@ u on him , the time that I shall visit him .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neigh@@ b@@ ors ; and he is no more .
I have heard news from Yah@@ we@@ h , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , G@@ ather yo@@ ur@@ selves together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ bles at the no@@ ise of their fall ; there is a cry , the no@@ ise which is heard in the Red Sea .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread out his w@@ ings against Boz@@ ra@@ h : and the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
Dam@@ as@@ cus has grown fe@@ e@@ ble , she turns her@@ self to flee , and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling has seized on her : an@@ gu@@ ish and sor@@ ro@@ ws have taken hold of her , as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
their ten@@ ts and their f@@ loc@@ ks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their cur@@ tains , and all their vessels , and their ca@@ me@@ ls ; and they shall cry to them , Ter@@ ror on every side !
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t concerning E@@ lam , in the beginning of the reign of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying ,
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land de@@ so@@ late , and none shall d@@ well there@@ in : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
they shall inqu@@ ire concerning Z@@ ion with their faces turned toward it , saying , C@@ ome , and join yo@@ ur@@ selves to Yah@@ we@@ h in an ever@@ lasting C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant that shall not be forgotten .
my people have been lost she@@ ep : their she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds have caused them to go as@@ tra@@ y ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and go forth out of the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and be as the male go@@ ats before the f@@ loc@@ ks .
because you are glad , because you re@@ jo@@ ice , O you who pl@@ under my heritage , because you are wan@@ ton as a he@@ if@@ er that t@@ reads out the gra@@ in , and ne@@ igh as strong hor@@ ses ;
your mother shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly disappointed ; she who b@@ ore you shall be con@@ founded : be@@ hold , she shall be the least of the nations , a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert .
because of the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wh@@ ol@@ ly de@@ so@@ late : everyone who goes by Bab@@ yl@@ on shall be ast@@ on@@ ished , and his@@ s at all her plagu@@ es .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him who hand@@ les the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hun@@ ted she@@ ep ; the li@@ ons have driven him away : first , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a dev@@ oured him ; and now at last Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on has broken his b@@ ones .
I will bring Israel again to his pas@@ ture , and he shall fe@@ ed on Car@@ mel and B@@ ash@@ an , and his sou@@ l shall be satisfied on the hil@@ ls of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and in G@@ il@@ e@@ ad .
go up against the land of Mer@@ ath@@ aim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pek@@ od : kill and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy after them , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Bab@@ yl@@ on , and you w@@ eren '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h has opened his arm@@ ory , and has brought forth the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation ; for the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , has a work to do in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
kill all her bul@@ ls ; let them go down to the sla@@ ughter : wo@@ e to them ! for their day has come , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on , to declare in Z@@ ion the ven@@ ge@@ ance of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , the ven@@ ge@@ ance of his temp@@ le .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to sil@@ ence in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the proud one shall st@@ um@@ ble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kin@@ dle a fire in his cities , and it shall dev@@ our all who are around him .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dri@@ ed up ; for it is a land of en@@ gra@@ ved images , and they are ma@@ d over id@@ ols .
be@@ hold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be s@@ tir@@ red up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on has heard the news of them , and his hands wa@@ x fe@@ e@@ ble : an@@ gu@@ ish has taken hold of him , pain@@ s as of a woman in la@@ bor .
I will send to Bab@@ yl@@ on st@@ ran@@ gers , who shall win@@ now her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
against him who ben@@ ds let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him who lif@@ ts himself up in his co@@ at of mail : and don '@@ t spar@@ e her young men ; ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all her army .
for Israel is not for@@ sak@@ en , nor Ju@@ da@@ h , of his God , of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies ; though their land is full of guil@@ t against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Yah@@ we@@ h 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der to her a re@@ compen@@ se .
Bab@@ yl@@ on has been a golden c@@ up in Yah@@ we@@ h 's hand , who made all the ear@@ th dr@@ un@@ ken : the nations have dr@@ un@@ k of her wine ; therefore the nations are ma@@ d .
we would have he@@ aled Bab@@ yl@@ on , but she is not he@@ aled : for@@ sake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heav@@ en , and is lifted up even to the sk@@ ies .
he has made the ear@@ th by his power , he has established the world by his wis@@ dom , and by his understanding has he stret@@ ched out the heav@@ ens :
every man has become bru@@ tish without knowledge . every gol@@ d@@ s@@ mit@@ h is disappointed by his image ; for his m@@ ol@@ ten image is fal@@ se@@ hood , and there is no bre@@ ath in them .
the portion of Jac@@ o@@ b is not like these ; for he is the former of all things ; and is the tri@@ be of his inher@@ it@@ ance : Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies is his name .
you are my battle ax@@ e and weapons of war : and with you will I break in pieces the nations ; and with you will I destroy k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ;
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Me@@ des , its govern@@ ors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their domin@@ ion .
the land tre@@ m@@ bles and is in p@@ ain ; for the purposes of Yah@@ we@@ h against Bab@@ yl@@ on do stand , to make the land of Bab@@ yl@@ on a de@@ so@@ lation , without inhabi@@ tant .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them dr@@ un@@ ken , that they may re@@ jo@@ ice , and sle@@ ep a perpet@@ ual sle@@ ep , and not wake , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
her cities are become a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert , a land in which no man d@@ wel@@ ls , neither does any son of man pass there@@ by .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , that I will exec@@ ute judgment on the en@@ gra@@ ved images of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and her whole land shall be con@@ founded ; and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
though Bab@@ yl@@ on should mount up to the sky , and though she should for@@ ti@@ fy the he@@ ight of her strength , yet from me shall destro@@ yers come to her , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
for Yah@@ we@@ h lays Bab@@ yl@@ on waste , and destro@@ ys out of her the great voice ; and their waves ro@@ ar like many waters ; the no@@ ise of their voice is ut@@ tered :
and say , Yah@@ we@@ h , you have spoken concerning this place , to cut it off , that none shall d@@ well there@@ in , neither man nor animal , but that it shall be de@@ so@@ late fore@@ ver .
Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ one years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned eleven years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jerem@@ i@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
for through the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h it happened in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence . Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursu@@ ed after the king , and over@@ took Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah in the pla@@ ins of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was sc@@ at@@ tered from him .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on killed the sons of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes : he killed also all the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h in R@@ ib@@ lah .
he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
and he burned the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
all the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , who were with the captain of the guard , broke down all the walls of Jer@@ usalem all around .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their br@@ ass to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on to R@@ ib@@ lah .
the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck them , and put them to death at R@@ ib@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Ju@@ da@@ h was carried away cap@@ tive out of his land .
in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar he carried away cap@@ tive from Jer@@ usalem eight hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ two persons ;
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
she we@@ ep@@ s bit@@ ter@@ ly in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks ; among all her lov@@ ers she has none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her ; they are become her enem@@ ies .
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the so@@ lem@@ n assembly ; all her gates are de@@ so@@ late , her pri@@ ests do si@@ gh : her vir@@ g@@ ins are aff@@ lic@@ ted , and she her@@ self is in bit@@ ter@@ ness .
from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her maj@@ es@@ ty is depar@@ ted : her pr@@ inces are become like har@@ ts that find no pas@@ ture , they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
her fil@@ th@@ iness was in her sk@@ ir@@ ts ; she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember her latter end ; therefore is she come down won@@ der@@ fully ; she has no comfor@@ ter : see , Yah@@ we@@ h , my aff@@ li@@ ction ; for the enemy has mag@@ ni@@ fied himself .
the ad@@ versary has spread out his hand on all her pleas@@ ant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , concerning whom you comman@@ ded that they should not enter into your assembly .
for these things I we@@ ep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Bec@@ ause the comfor@@ ter who should ref@@ res@@ h my sou@@ l is far from me : my children are de@@ so@@ late , because the enemy has prev@@ ailed .
I called for my lov@@ ers , but they dec@@ e@@ ived me : my pri@@ ests and my el@@ ders gave up the spirit in the city , Wh@@ ile they sought them food to ref@@ res@@ h their so@@ ul@@ s .
let all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess come before you ; D@@ o to them , as you have done to me for all my trans@@ gres@@ sions : for my si@@ gh@@ s are many , and my heart is fa@@ int .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger ! he has cast down from heav@@ en to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , An@@ d has@@ n '@@ t remember@@ ed his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger .
he has cut off in fierce an@@ ger all the Hor@@ n of Israel ; He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy : he has burned up Jac@@ o@@ b like a f@@ laming fire , which dev@@ ours all around .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has sw@@ allowed up Israel ; He has sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces , he has destroyed his stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ; He has multi@@ p@@ lied in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit on the ground , they keep sil@@ ence ; They have cast up d@@ ust on their heads ; they have clo@@ th@@ ed themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
they tell their mothers , W@@ here is gra@@ in and wine ? when they s@@ wo@@ on as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their sou@@ l is p@@ oured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
your pro@@ ph@@ ets have seen for you false and fo@@ ol@@ ish visions ; They have not uncovered your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , to bring back your cap@@ tivity , but have seen for you false or@@ ac@@ les and causes of ban@@ is@@ hment .
look , Yah@@ we@@ h , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are d@@ and@@ led in the hands ? shall the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t be killed in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord ?
he has turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he has made me de@@ so@@ late .
it is good that a man should hope and qu@@ i@@ et@@ ly wait for the sal@@ vation of Yah@@ we@@ h .
let him put his m@@ outh in the d@@ ust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his che@@ ek to him who strikes him ; let him be filled full with re@@ pro@@ ach .
you will ren@@ der to them a re@@ compen@@ se , Yah@@ we@@ h , according to the work of their hands .
how the gold has become dim ! the most p@@ ure gold has changed ! the stones of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary are p@@ oured out at the head of every street .
even the j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s draw out the bre@@ ast , they nur@@ se their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cru@@ el , like the os@@ tri@@ ches in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
the ton@@ gue of the nur@@ sing child cl@@ ings to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of So@@ dom , That was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
her no@@ bles were pu@@ rer than snow , they were w@@ hi@@ ter than milk ; They were more ru@@ d@@ dy in body than ru@@ bies , their polis@@ hing was as of sap@@ ph@@ ire .
their appearance is bla@@ cker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their s@@ kin cl@@ ings to their b@@ ones ; it is with@@ ered , it has become like a stick .
those who are killed with the s@@ word are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through , for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have bo@@ iled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Yah@@ we@@ h has accomplished his wr@@ ath , he has p@@ oured out his fierce an@@ ger ; He has kin@@ d@@ led a fire in Z@@ ion , which has dev@@ oured its foundations .
it is because of the sin@@ s of her pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities of her pri@@ ests , That have shed the blood of the just in the mid@@ st of her .
they w@@ ander as b@@ lin@@ d men in the streets , they are pollu@@ ted with blood , S@@ o that men can '@@ t touch their gar@@ ments .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h has sc@@ at@@ tered them ; he will no more regard them : they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t respect the persons of the pri@@ ests , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fav@@ or the el@@ ders .
they hunt our steps , so that we can '@@ t go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end has come .
our pursu@@ ers were swi@@ f@@ ter than the e@@ ag@@ les of the sky : they ch@@ ased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ well in the land of U@@ z : the c@@ up shall pass through to you also ; you shall be dr@@ un@@ ken , and shall make yo@@ ur@@ self nak@@ ed .
we have given the hand to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , To the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , to be satisfied with bread .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its mid@@ st came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . this was their appearance : they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot ; and they spar@@ k@@ led like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
they had the hands of a man under their w@@ ings on their four sides ; and the four of them had their faces and their w@@ ings thus :
now as I saw the living cre@@ atures , be@@ hold , one whe@@ el on the ear@@ th bes@@ ide the living cre@@ atures , for each of the four faces of it .
the appearance of the whe@@ els and their work was like a ber@@ y@@ l : and the four of them had one lik@@ eness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a whe@@ el within a whe@@ el .
as for their ri@@ ms , they were high and d@@ read@@ ful ; and the four of them had their ri@@ ms full of eyes all around .
wher@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the whe@@ els were lifted up bes@@ ide them ; for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
over the head of the living cre@@ ature there was the lik@@ eness of an exp@@ ans@@ e , like the aw@@ es@@ ome cr@@ y@@ st@@ al to look on , stret@@ ched forth over their heads above .
there was a voice above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their w@@ ings .
above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone ; and on the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was a lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man on it above .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your bel@@ ly to eat , and fill your bo@@ wel@@ s with this s@@ cr@@ oll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh .
not to many peoples of a st@@ range speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . su@@ rely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
but the house of Israel will not listen to you ; for they will not listen to me : for all the house of Israel are ob@@ st@@ in@@ ate and hard @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your e@@ ars .
go to them of the cap@@ tivity , to the children of your people , and speak to them , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ; whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear .
I heard the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures as they touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them , even the no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was strong on me .
then I came to them of the cap@@ tivity at Tel Avi@@ v , that lived by the river C@@ he@@ bar , and to where they lived ; and I sat there overwhel@@ med among them seven days .
it happened at the end of seven days , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
yet if you warn the w@@ ic@@ ked , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , nor from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity ; but you have delivered your sou@@ l .
but you , son of man , be@@ hold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bin@@ d you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your ton@@ gue stick to the ro@@ of of your m@@ outh , that you shall be m@@ ute , and shall not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build for@@ ts against it , and cast up a mo@@ und against it ; set camps also against it , and plant bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it all around .
for I have appointed the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred n@@ in@@ ety days : so you shall bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
be@@ hold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
your food which you shall eat shall be by weight , twenty sh@@ ek@@ els a day : from time to time you shall eat it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments in the mid@@ st of you in the sight of the nations .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of you , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you ; and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ at@@ ter to all the winds .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their id@@ ols ; and I will sc@@ at@@ ter your b@@ ones around your al@@ tar@@ s .
yet will I leave a re@@ mn@@ ant , in that you shall have some that escape the s@@ word among the nations , when you shall be sc@@ at@@ tered through the countries .
he who is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he who is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he who remains and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my wr@@ ath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to the land of Israel , A@@ n end : the end has come on the four cor@@ ners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my an@@ ger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
your do@@ om has come to you , inhabi@@ tant of the land : the time has come , the day is near , a day of t@@ um@@ ult , and not of jo@@ y@@ ful sh@@ ou@@ ting , on the mountains .
now will I shortly p@@ our out my wr@@ ath on you , and accomp@@ lish my an@@ ger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
they shall also clo@@ the themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and hor@@ ror shall cover them ; and sh@@ ame shall be on all faces , and bal@@ d@@ ness on all their heads .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty ; but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I made it to them as an un@@ clean thing .
I will give it into the hands of the st@@ ran@@ gers for a pre@@ y , and to the w@@ ic@@ ked of the ear@@ th for a sp@@ oil ; and they shall prof@@ ane it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall prof@@ ane my secret place ; and rob@@ bers shall enter into it , and prof@@ ane it .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be prof@@ an@@ ed .
be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the pla@@ in .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of cre@@ eping things , and ab@@ omin@@ able animals , and all the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed around on the wall .
as for me also , my eye shall not spar@@ e , neither will I have p@@ ity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m there appeared above them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h moun@@ ted up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory .
I looked , and be@@ hold , four whe@@ els bes@@ ide the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , one whe@@ el bes@@ ide one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el bes@@ ide another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b ; and the appearance of the whe@@ els was like a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
when they went , they went in their four direc@@ tions : they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn as they went , but to the place where the head looked they followed it ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn as they went .
when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m went , the whe@@ els went bes@@ ide them ; and when the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings to mount up from the ear@@ th , the whe@@ els also di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn from bes@@ ide them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they moun@@ ted up , these moun@@ ted up with them : for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in them .
as for the lik@@ eness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves ; they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h fell on me , and he said to me , Spe@@ ak , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
I will bring you forth out of its mid@@ st , and deliver you into the hands of st@@ ran@@ gers , and will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments among you .
you shall fall by the s@@ word ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : for you have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have you executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , but have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will gather you from the peoples , and assem@@ ble you out of the countries where you have been sc@@ at@@ tered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
that they may walk in my stat@@ utes , and keep my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walk@@ s after the heart of their de@@ te@@ stable things and their ab@@ omin@@ ations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
then the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m lifted up their w@@ ings , and the whe@@ els were bes@@ ide them ; and the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel was over them above .
you shall bring forth your stu@@ ff by day in their sight , as stu@@ ff for moving ; and you shall go forth yo@@ ur@@ self at even in their sight , as when men go forth into ex@@ ile .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the s@@ word after them .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I shall disper@@ se them among the nations , and sc@@ at@@ ter them through the countries .
son of man , be@@ hold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they have seen fal@@ se@@ hood and lying div@@ ination , who say , Yah@@ we@@ h says ; but Yah@@ we@@ h has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you seen a false vision , and ha@@ ven '@@ t you spoken a lying div@@ ination , in that you say , Yah@@ we@@ h says ; but I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have s@@ educ@@ ed my people , saying , Peace ; and there is no peace ; and when one buil@@ ds up a wall , be@@ hold , they plas@@ ter it with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h :
tell those who plas@@ ter it with w@@ hi@@ te@@ was@@ h , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flow@@ ing sho@@ wer ; and you , great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall tear it .
be@@ hold , when the wall has fallen , shall it not be said to you , W@@ here is the plas@@ ter with which you have plas@@ tered it ?
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
because with lies you have gri@@ ev@@ ed the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , and be sav@@ ed alive :
if the pro@@ phe@@ t is dec@@ e@@ ived and speak a word , I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have dec@@ e@@ ived that pro@@ phe@@ t , and I will stretch out my hand on him , and will destroy him from the mid@@ st of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more as@@ tra@@ y from me , neither def@@ ile themselves any more with all their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
if I cause ev@@ il animals to pass through the land , and they rav@@ age it , and it be made de@@ so@@ late , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
though No@@ ah , Daniel , and Jo@@ b , were in it , as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , they should deliver neither son nor daughter ; they should but deliver their own so@@ ul@@ s by their righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
be@@ hold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire has dev@@ oured both its ends , and its mid@@ st is burned : is it profitable for any work ?
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to Jer@@ usalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite ; the Am@@ or@@ ite was your father , and your mother was a H@@ itti@@ te .
as for your birth , in the day you were born your nav@@ el was not cut , neither were you was@@ hed in water to cleans@@ e you ; you w@@ eren '@@ t sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
when I passed by you , and saw you w@@ allowing in your blood , I said to you , Th@@ ough you are in your blood , live ; yes , I said to you , Th@@ ough you are in your blood , live .
then was@@ hed I you with water ; yes , I thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly was@@ hed away your blood from you , and I ano@@ in@@ ted you with oil .
I dec@@ ked you with or@@ nam@@ ents , and I put brac@@ ele@@ ts on your hands , and a chain on your nec@@ k .
your ren@@ own went forth among the nations for your beauty ; for it was perfect , through my maj@@ es@@ ty which I had put on you , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
you also took your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yo@@ ur@@ self images of men , and played the pro@@ stitute with them ;
moreover you have taken your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , whom you have bor@@ ne to me , and you have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed these to them to be dev@@ oured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
that you have sla@@ in my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
in all your ab@@ omin@@ ations and your prostitution you have not remember@@ ed the days of your youth , when you were nak@@ ed and b@@ are , and were w@@ allowing in your blood .
you have built your lo@@ f@@ ty place at the head of every way , and have made your beauty an ab@@ omin@@ ation , and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by , and multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution .
you have also committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , your neigh@@ b@@ ors , great of f@@ les@@ h ; and have multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
you have played the pro@@ stitute also with the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , because you were ins@@ ati@@ able ; yes , you have played the pro@@ stitute with them , and yet you w@@ eren '@@ t satisfied .
you have moreover multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution to the land of mer@@ chan@@ ts , to Chal@@ de@@ a ; and yet you w@@ eren '@@ t satisfied with this .
in that you build your va@@ ulted place at the head of every way , and make your lo@@ f@@ ty place in every street , and have not been as a pro@@ stitute , in that you scor@@ n pay .
they give gifts to all pro@@ stitu@@ tes ; but you give your gifts to all your lov@@ ers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
they shall also bring up a company against you , and they shall stone you with stones , and th@@ rust you through with their s@@ words .
they shall bur@@ n your houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to ce@@ ase from playing the pro@@ stitute , and you shall also give no h@@ ire any more .
your el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your left hand , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and your younger sister , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their ab@@ omin@@ ations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , So@@ dom your sister has not done , she nor her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , as you have done , you and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
be@@ hold , this was the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of your sister So@@ dom : pride , ful@@ l@@ ness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
neither has Samar@@ ia committed half of your sin@@ s ; but you have multi@@ p@@ lied your ab@@ omin@@ ations more than they , and have justified your s@@ ist@@ ers by all your ab@@ omin@@ ations which you have done .
I will turn again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of your cap@@ tives in their mid@@ st ;
that you may bear your own sh@@ ame , and may be as@@ ha@@ med because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfor@@ t to them .
that you may remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open your m@@ outh any more , because of your sh@@ ame , when I have for@@ given you all that you have done , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
he cro@@ pped off the top@@ most of the young tw@@ ig@@ s of it , and carried it to a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of mer@@ chan@@ ts .
he took also of the se@@ ed of the land , and plan@@ ted it in a fruit@@ ful soil ; he placed it bes@@ ide many waters ; he set it as a w@@ il@@ low tree .
it was plan@@ ted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a good@@ ly v@@ ine .
and he took of the se@@ ed royal , and made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the m@@ igh@@ ty of the land ;
for he has desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and be@@ hold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
what do you mean , that you use this pro@@ ver@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fa@@ thers have e@@ aten s@@ our grap@@ es , and the children 's te@@ eth are set on edge ?
be@@ hold , all so@@ ul@@ s are mine ; as the sou@@ l of the father , so also the sou@@ l of the son is mine : the sou@@ l who sin@@ s , he shall die .
and has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither has def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
and has not wron@@ ged any , but has restored to the deb@@ tor his pledge , has taken nothing by rob@@ bery , has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
who has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , has not def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife ,
neither has wron@@ ged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by rob@@ bery , but has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , has walked in my stat@@ utes ; he shall not die for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall su@@ rely live .
as for his father , because he cru@@ el@@ ly op@@ pressed , ro@@ bbed his brother , and did that which is not good among his people , be@@ hold , he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked turn from all his sin@@ s that he has committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
none of his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he has committed shall be remember@@ ed against him : in his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness that he has done he shall live .
because he considers , and turns away from all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he has committed , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , in which you have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make yo@@ ur@@ self a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their p@@ it ; and they brought him with ho@@ oks to the land of Egypt .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their p@@ it .
they put him in a c@@ age with ho@@ oks , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; they brought him into stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
it had strong ro@@ ds for the scep@@ ters of those who b@@ ore rule , and their stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and they were seen in their he@@ ight with the multi@@ tude of their branches .
in that day I s@@ wor@@ e to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands .
I said to them , cast away every man the ab@@ omin@@ ations of his eyes , and don '@@ t def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with the id@@ ols of Egypt ; I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
so I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
I gave them my stat@@ utes , and showed them my ord@@ inan@@ ces , which if a man does , he shall live in them .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I s@@ wor@@ e to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
because they rejected my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t walk in my stat@@ utes , and prof@@ an@@ ed my Sab@@ ba@@ ths : for their heart went after their id@@ ols .
nevertheless my eye spar@@ ed them , and I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
I said to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , D@@ on '@@ t walk in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their ord@@ inan@@ ces , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I s@@ wor@@ e to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would sc@@ at@@ ter them among the nations , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , but had rejected my stat@@ utes , and had prof@@ an@@ ed my Sab@@ ba@@ ths , and their eyes were after their fa@@ thers ' id@@ ols .
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in this moreover have your fa@@ thers b@@ las@@ phe@@ med me , in that they have committed a t@@ res@@ pass against me .
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out ;
and I will bring you into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
like as I entered into judgment with your fa@@ thers in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will cause you to pass under the ro@@ d , and I will bring you into the bond of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country which I s@@ wor@@ e to give to your fa@@ thers .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your ev@@ il ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
then I said , A@@ h Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ! they say of me , Is@@ n '@@ t he a speaker of par@@ ables ?
and tell the land of Israel , Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I am against you , and will draw forth my s@@ word out of its she@@ ath , and will cut off from you the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righ@@ te@@ ous and the w@@ ic@@ ked , therefore shall my s@@ word go forth out of its she@@ ath against all f@@ les@@ h from the south to the north :
it is shar@@ pen@@ ed that it may make a sla@@ ughter ; it is fur@@ b@@ ished that it may be as ligh@@ t@@ ning : shall we then make mir@@ th ? the ro@@ d of my son , it condem@@ ns every tree .
it is given to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : the s@@ word , it is shar@@ pen@@ ed , yes , it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the kil@@ ler .
I have set the threatening s@@ word against all their gates , that their heart may mel@@ t , and their stumb@@ lings be multi@@ p@@ lied : ah ! it is made as ligh@@ t@@ ning , it is pointed for sla@@ ughter .
it shall be to them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , who have sworn o@@ aths to them ; but he brings in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to memory , that they may be taken .
I will over@@ turn , over@@ turn , over@@ turn it : this also shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ him ] .
cause it to return into its she@@ ath . in the place where you were created , in the land of your birth , will I judge you .
I will p@@ our out my in@@ dign@@ ation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wr@@ ath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful to destroy .
you shall say , Th@@ us says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : a city that sh@@ eds blood in the mid@@ st of her , that her time may come , and that makes id@@ ols against her@@ self to def@@ ile her !
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the mid@@ st of you have they dealt by op@@ pression with the foreig@@ ner ; in you have they wron@@ ged the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
one has committed ab@@ omin@@ ation with his neigh@@ bor 's wife ; and another has le@@ w@@ dly def@@ iled his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; and another in you has hum@@ b@@ led his sister , his father 's daughter .
be@@ hold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dis@@ honest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the mid@@ st of you .
can your heart en@@ dur@@ e , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it , and will do it .
I will sc@@ at@@ ter you among the nations , and disper@@ se you through the countries ; and I will consum@@ e your fil@@ th@@ iness out of you .
you shall be prof@@ an@@ ed in yo@@ ur@@ self , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , the house of Israel has become dro@@ ss to me : all of them are br@@ ass and tin and iron and lead , in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace ; they are the dro@@ ss of silver .
yes , I will gather you , and blow on you with the fire of my wr@@ ath , and you shall be mel@@ ted in its mid@@ st .
as silver is mel@@ ted in the mid@@ st of the fur@@ n@@ ace , so you will be mel@@ ted in its mid@@ st ; and you will know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have p@@ oured out my wr@@ ath on you .
her pr@@ inces in its mid@@ st are like w@@ ol@@ ves ra@@ ven@@ ing the pre@@ y , to shed blood , [ and ] to destroy so@@ ul@@ s , that they may get dis@@ honest gain .
therefore have I p@@ oured out my in@@ dign@@ ation on them ; I have consu@@ med them with the fire of my wr@@ ath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
and they played the pro@@ stitute in Egypt ; they played the pro@@ stitute in their youth ; there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there was handled the bos@@ om of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
she bes@@ to@@ wed her prostitution on them , the cho@@ ic@@ est men of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a all of them ; and on who@@ ever she do@@ ted , with all their id@@ ols she def@@ iled her@@ self .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ gin@@ ity ; and they p@@ oured out their prostitution on her .
these uncovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess ; they took her sons and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and her they killed with the s@@ word : and she became a by@@ word among women ; for they executed judg@@ ments on her .
her sister O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah saw this , yet was she more corrupt in her do@@ ting than she , and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nak@@ edn@@ ess : then my sou@@ l was ali@@ en@@ ated from her , like as my sou@@ l was ali@@ en@@ ated from her sister .
yet she multi@@ p@@ lied her prostitution , remember@@ ing the days of her youth , in which she had played the pro@@ stitute in the land of Egypt .
she do@@ ted on their param@@ ours , whose f@@ les@@ h is as the f@@ les@@ h of don@@ ke@@ ys , and whose issue is like the issue of hor@@ ses .
therefore , O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah , thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will raise up your lov@@ ers against you , from whom your sou@@ l is ali@@ en@@ ated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you h@@ ate , into the hand of them from whom your sou@@ l is ali@@ en@@ ated ;
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gn@@ a@@ w the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your bre@@ asts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a mes@@ sen@@ ger was sent , and be@@ hold , they came ; for whom you did was@@ h yo@@ ur@@ self , pain@@ t your eyes , and decor@@ ate yo@@ ur@@ self with or@@ nam@@ ents ,
they went in to her , as they go in to a pro@@ stitute : so went they in to O@@ ho@@ lah and to O@@ hol@@ i@@ bah , the le@@ w@@ d women .
R@@ igh@@ te@@ ous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tos@@ sed back and forth and ro@@ bbed .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall kill their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
for her blood is in the mid@@ st of her ; she set it on the b@@ are rock ; she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t p@@ our it on the ground , to cover it with d@@ ust .
that it may cause wr@@ ath to come up to take ven@@ ge@@ ance , I have set her blood on the b@@ are rock , that it should not be covered .
then set it empty on its co@@ als , that it may be hot , and its br@@ ass may bur@@ n , and that its fil@@ th@@ iness may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that its rust may be consu@@ med .
she has we@@ ar@@ ied [ her@@ self ] with to@@ il ; yet her great rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go forth out of her ; her rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t [ go forth ] by fire .
in your fil@@ th@@ iness is le@@ w@@ d@@ ness : because I have cleans@@ ed you and you w@@ eren '@@ t cleans@@ ed , you shall not be cleans@@ ed from your fil@@ th@@ iness any more , until I have caused my wr@@ ath toward you to rest .
son of man , be@@ hold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stro@@ ke : yet you shall neither mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall your te@@ ars run down .
si@@ gh , but not al@@ oud , make no mourning for the dead ; bin@@ d your he@@ address on you , and put your sho@@ es on your feet , and don '@@ t cover your li@@ ps , and don '@@ t eat men 's bread .
so I spoke to the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was comman@@ ded .
your ti@@ res shall be on your heads , and your sho@@ es on your feet : you shall not mour@@ n nor we@@ ep ; but you shall p@@ ine away in your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , and mo@@ an one toward another .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you have cla@@ pped your hands , and st@@ amp@@ ed with the feet , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with all the despite of your sou@@ l against the land of Israel ;
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth J@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al Me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because E@@ dom has dealt against the house of Ju@@ da@@ h by taking ven@@ ge@@ ance , and has greatly off@@ ended , and reven@@ ged himself on them ;
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I will stretch out my hand on the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and I will cut off the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and destroy the re@@ mn@@ ant of the sea coast .
it happened in the ele@@ venth year , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , be@@ hold , I am against you , T@@ y@@ re , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
she shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets in the mid@@ st of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she shall become a sp@@ oil to the nations .
he shall kill your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters in the field with the s@@ word ; and he shall make for@@ ts against you , and cast up a mo@@ und against you , and raise up the bu@@ ck@@ ler against you .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the s@@ word ; and the pil@@ lars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
now shall the islands tre@@ m@@ ble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dis@@ may@@ ed at your departure .
of the o@@ aks of B@@ ash@@ an have they made your o@@ ars ; they have made your ben@@ ches of Iv@@ ory in@@ laid in box@@ wood , from the islands of Kit@@ tim .
of fine lin@@ en with em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered work from Egypt was your sa@@ il , that it might be to you for a ban@@ ner ; blue and pur@@ ple from the islands of E@@ lis@@ ha@@ h was your aw@@ ning .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with your army were on your walls all around , and val@@ or@@ ous men were in your tow@@ ers ; they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds on your walls all around ; they have perf@@ ected your beauty .
Ju@@ da@@ h , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they tra@@ ded for your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise wheat of Min@@ n@@ ith , and conf@@ ections , and hon@@ ey , and oil , and bal@@ m .
Arabia , and all the pr@@ inces of K@@ ed@@ ar , they were the mer@@ chan@@ ts of your hand ; in lam@@ bs , and r@@ ams , and go@@ ats , in these were they your mer@@ chan@@ ts .
these were your traffickers in choice war@@ es , in wrap@@ p@@ ings of blue and em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered work , and in ch@@ ests of rich clo@@ thing , bound with cor@@ ds and made of c@@ ed@@ ar , among your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish were your car@@ av@@ ans for your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise : and you were rep@@ len@@ ished , and made very g@@ lor@@ ious in the heart of the seas .
all who handled the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , [ and ] all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust on their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves bal@@ d for you , and clo@@ the them with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and they shall we@@ ep for you in bit@@ ter@@ ness of sou@@ l with bitter mourning .
when your war@@ es went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you en@@ ri@@ ched the kings of the ear@@ th with the multi@@ tude of your ri@@ ches and of your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise .
in the time that you were broken by the seas in the dep@@ ths of the waters , your mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise and all your company fell in your mid@@ st .
by your great wis@@ dom [ and ] by your traffic you have increased your ri@@ ches , and your heart is lifted up because of your ri@@ ches@@ --
therefore , be@@ hold , I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers on you , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile your bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
they shall bring you down to the p@@ it ; and you shall die the death of those who are sla@@ in , in the heart of the seas .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness was found in you .
for I will send p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the mid@@ st of her , with the s@@ word on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twel@@ f@@ th day of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and t@@ ore all their sho@@ ul@@ ders ; and when they le@@ an@@ ed on you , you broke , and paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed all of their th@@ igh@@ s . "
the land of Egypt shall be a de@@ so@@ lation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
and I will bring back the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the base of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
in that day will I cause a Hor@@ n to bu@@ d forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the m@@ outh in their mid@@ st ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
for the day is near , even the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is near ; it shall be a day of cl@@ ou@@ ds , a time of the nations .
a s@@ word shall come on Egypt , and an@@ gu@@ ish shall be in Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , when the sla@@ in shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multi@@ tude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : they also who up@@ hold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the to@@ wer of Sev@@ en@@ e@@ h shall they fall in it by the s@@ word , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
they shall be de@@ so@@ late in the mid@@ st of the countries that are de@@ so@@ late ; and her cities shall be in the mid@@ st of the cities that are was@@ ted .
they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her hel@@ pers are destroyed .
in that day shall mes@@ sen@@ gers go forth from before me in ships to make the car@@ ele@@ ss Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians afraid ; and there shall be an@@ gu@@ ish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , be@@ hold , it comes .
he and his people with him , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sla@@ in .
I will set a fire in Egypt : sin shall be in great an@@ gu@@ ish , and No shall be broken up ; and Mem@@ p@@ his [ shall have ] ad@@ vers@@ aries in the day@@ time .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put my s@@ word in his hand : but I will break the arms of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and he shall gro@@ an before him with the gro@@ an@@ ings of a deadly wounded man .
be@@ hold , the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an was a c@@ ed@@ ar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @@@ -@@ @ like sha@@ de , and of high stat@@ ure ; and its top was among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
the waters no@@ ur@@ ished it , the deep made it to grow : its rivers ran all around its plan@@ tation ; and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field .
therefore its stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field ; and its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nes@@ ts in its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I made it beautiful by the multi@@ tude of its branches , so that all the trees of E@@ den , that were in the gar@@ den of God , en@@ vi@@ ed it .
therefore thus said the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : because you are ex@@ al@@ ted in stat@@ ure , and he has set his top among the th@@ ick b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , and his heart is lifted up in his he@@ ight ;
I will even deliver him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the nations ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
on his ru@@ in all the birds of the sky shall d@@ well , and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches ;
they also went down into She@@ ol with him to those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the nations .
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
I will also water with your blood the land in which you sw@@ im , even to the mountains ; and the water@@ courses shall be full of you .
when I shall ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish you , I will cover the heav@@ ens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause your multi@@ tude to fall ; the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multi@@ tude shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all its animals from bes@@ ide many waters ; neither shall the fo@@ ot of man trouble them any more , nor the ho@@ of@@ s of animals trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late and waste , a land de@@ stitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened also in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the fif@@ teen@@ th [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the ear@@ th , with those who go down into the p@@ it .
they shall fall in the mid@@ st of those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : she is delivered to the s@@ word ; draw her away and all her multi@@ tu@@ des .
whose graves are set in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the p@@ it , and her company is around her grave ; all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Mes@@ h@@ ech , T@@ ub@@ al , and all their multi@@ tude ; their graves are around them ; all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings and all her pr@@ inces , who in their might are laid with those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with those who go down to the p@@ it .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multi@@ tude , even P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and all his army , sla@@ in by the s@@ word , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
then who@@ ever he@@ ars the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t take warning , if the s@@ word come , and take him away , his blood shall be on his own head .
he heard the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his sou@@ l .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watch@@ man to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my m@@ outh , and give them warning from me .
nevertheless , if you warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his way ; he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , but you have delivered your sou@@ l .
again , when I say to the w@@ ic@@ ked , You shall su@@ rely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is law@@ ful and right ;
none of his sin@@ s that he has committed shall be remember@@ ed against him : he has done that which is law@@ ful and right ; he shall su@@ rely live .
I will make the land a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment ; and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase ; and the mountains of Israel shall be de@@ so@@ late , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have made the land a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment , because of all their ab@@ omin@@ ations which they have committed .
they were sc@@ at@@ tered , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were sc@@ at@@ tered .
my she@@ ep w@@ and@@ ered through all the mountains , and on every high hill : yes , my she@@ ep were sc@@ at@@ tered on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; and there was none who searched or sought .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I myself , even I , will search for my she@@ ep , and will seek them out .
as for my she@@ ep , they eat that which you have tro@@ dden with your feet , and they drink that which you have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
I will set up one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d over them , and he shall fe@@ ed them , even my ser@@ vant David ; he shall fe@@ ed them , and he shall be their she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
I will make with them a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace , and will cause ev@@ il animals to ce@@ ase out of the land ; and they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and sle@@ ep in the wo@@ ods .
I will make them and the places around my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in its season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the nations , neither shall the animals of the ear@@ th dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plan@@ tation for ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with fam@@ ine in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the nations any more .
because you have had a perpet@@ ual en@@ mity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the s@@ word in the time of their cal@@ am@@ ity , in the time of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the end ;
therefore , as I live , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , I will prepare you for blood , and blood shall pursue you : since you have not ha@@ ted blood , therefore blood shall pursue you .
thus will I make Mount Se@@ ir an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment and a de@@ so@@ lation ; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns .
I will fill its mountains with its sla@@ in : in your hil@@ ls and in your val@@ ley@@ s and in all your water@@ courses shall they fall who are sla@@ in with the s@@ word .
you have mag@@ ni@@ fied yo@@ ur@@ selves against me with your m@@ outh , and have multi@@ p@@ lied your words against me : I have heard it .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : I have sworn , [ saying ] , su@@ rely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their sh@@ ame .
for , be@@ hold , I am for you , and I will turn into you , and you shall be til@@ led and so@@ wn ;
and I will multi@@ ply men on you , all the house of Israel , even all of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built ;
neither will I let you hear any more the sh@@ ame of the nations , neither shall you bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to st@@ um@@ ble any more , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they def@@ iled it by their way and by their do@@ ings : their way before me was as the un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess of a woman in her imp@@ urity .
therefore I p@@ oured out my wr@@ ath on them for the blood which they had p@@ oured out on the land , and because they had def@@ iled it with their id@@ ols ;
and I sc@@ at@@ tered them among the nations , and they were disper@@ sed through the countries : according to their way and according to their do@@ ings I jud@@ ged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they prof@@ an@@ ed my hol@@ y name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my hol@@ y name , which the house of Israel had prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , where they went .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you a heart of f@@ les@@ h .
I will put my Spiri@@ t within you , and cause you to walk in my stat@@ utes , and you shall keep my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and do them .
you shall d@@ well in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers ; and you shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will save you from all your un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess : and I will call for the gra@@ in , and will multi@@ ply it , and lay no fam@@ ine on you .
I will multi@@ ply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the re@@ pro@@ ach of fam@@ ine among the nations .
then you shall remember your ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the day that I cleans@@ e you from all your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
the land that was de@@ so@@ late shall be til@@ led , whereas it was a de@@ so@@ lation in the sight of all who passed by .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jer@@ usalem in her appointed fe@@ asts , so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ loc@@ ks of men ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me out in the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley ; and it was full of b@@ ones .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and be@@ hold , there were very many in the open val@@ ley ; and be@@ hold , they were very d@@ ry .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h to these b@@ ones : be@@ hold , I will cause bre@@ ath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sin@@ ews on you , and will bring up f@@ les@@ h on you , and cover you with s@@ kin , and put bre@@ ath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
so I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied as I was comman@@ ded : and as I pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ied , there was a no@@ ise , and be@@ hold , an earthquake ; and the b@@ ones came together , bone to its bone .
I saw , and , be@@ hold , there were sin@@ ews on them , and f@@ les@@ h came up , and s@@ kin covered them above ; but there was no bre@@ ath in them .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spiri@@ t in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Yah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it and performed it , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
my ser@@ vant David shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d : they shall also walk in my ord@@ inan@@ ces , and observe my stat@@ utes , and do them .
you shall as@@ cen@@ d , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cl@@ oud to cover the land , you , and all your hor@@ des , and many peoples with you .
it shall happen in that day , when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , that my wr@@ ath shall come up into my nos@@ tr@@ ils .
for in my je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and in the fire of my wr@@ ath have I spoken , su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shak@@ ing in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a s@@ word against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : every man 's s@@ word shall be against his brother .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
and I will strike your bo@@ w out of your left hand , and will cause your ar@@ ro@@ ws to fall out of your right hand .
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the under@@ tak@@ ers have buried it in the val@@ ley of Ham@@ on Go@@ g .
you shall eat f@@ at until you be full , and drink blood until you are dr@@ un@@ k , of my sacrifice which I have sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed for you .
I will set my gl@@ ory among the nations ; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid on them .
according to their un@@ cle@@ ann@@ ess and according to their trans@@ gres@@ sions did I to them ; and I hi@@ d my face from them .
therefore thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : now will I bring back the cap@@ tivity of Jac@@ o@@ b , and have mer@@ cy on the whole house of Israel ; and I will be Je@@ al@@ ous for my hol@@ y name .
they shall bear their sh@@ ame , and all their t@@ res@@ passes by which they have t@@ res@@ passed against me , when they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enem@@ ies ' lands , and am sanc@@ ti@@ fied in them in the sight of many nations .
he brought me there ; and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold , one Re@@ ed broad .
every lo@@ dge was one Re@@ ed long , and one Re@@ ed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lo@@ dges was five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the threshold of the gate by the por@@ ch of the gate toward the house was one Re@@ ed .
he meas@@ ured also the por@@ ch of the gate toward the house , one Re@@ ed .
then meas@@ ured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and its posts , two cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was toward the house .
and a border before the lo@@ dges , one cu@@ bit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cu@@ bit on that side ; and the lo@@ dges , six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
he meas@@ ured the gate from the ro@@ of of the one lo@@ dge to the ro@@ of of the other , a b@@ read@@ th of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts ; door against door .
[ from ] the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the gate at the entrance to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner por@@ ch of the gate were fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
then he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the lower gate to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner court outside , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lo@@ dges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its ar@@ ches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
there was a gate to the in@@ ner court over against the [ other ] gate , [ both ] on the north and on the east ; and he meas@@ ured from gate to gate one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
and its lo@@ dges , and its posts , and its ar@@ ches , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in its ar@@ ches all around ; it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
and its lo@@ dges , and its posts , and its ar@@ ches , according to these measures : and there were windows there@@ in and in its ar@@ ches all around ; it was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts long , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts broad .
the ar@@ ches of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
in the por@@ ch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to kill there@@ on the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sin offering and the t@@ res@@ pass offering .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , where@@ upon they killed [ the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ] .
he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tent .
then he meas@@ ured the wall of the house , six cu@@ bi@@ ts ; and the b@@ read@@ th of every side room , four cu@@ bi@@ ts , all around the house on every side .
the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall , which was for the side rooms , on the outside , was five cu@@ bi@@ ts : and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts all around .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was sev@@ enty cu@@ bi@@ ts broad ; and the wall of the building was five cu@@ bi@@ ts th@@ ick all around , and its length n@@ in@@ ety cu@@ bi@@ ts .
also the b@@ read@@ th of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts .
as for the temp@@ le , the door posts were s@@ quar@@ ed ; and as for the face of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temp@@ le ] .
the doors had two leaves [ ap@@ i@@ ece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were closed windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the th@@ res@@ holds .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
for they were in three stories , and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have pil@@ lars as the pil@@ lars of the courts : therefore [ the up@@ per@@ most ] was stra@@ it@@ ened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
in the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were rooms .
now when he had made an end of measuring the in@@ ner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and meas@@ ured it all around .
be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
the Spiri@@ t took me up , and brought me into the in@@ ner court ; and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will d@@ well in their mid@@ st fore@@ ver .
this is the law of the house : on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most hol@@ y . be@@ hold , this is the law of the house .
from the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th one cu@@ bit ; and from the les@@ ser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th a cu@@ bit .
you shall give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes who are of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , a young bul@@ l for a sin offering .
you shall also take the bul@@ l of the sin offering , and it shall be bur@@ n@@ t in the appointed place of the house , outside of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h , and a ram out of the flock without ble@@ mis@@ h .
you shall bring them near to Yah@@ we@@ h , and the pri@@ ests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and I fell on my face .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , No foreig@@ ner , un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart and un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in f@@ les@@ h , shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel .
yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house , for all its service , and for all that shall be done there@@ in .
they shall enter into my sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my in@@ struction .
they shall have lin@@ en ti@@ res on their heads , and shall have lin@@ en bre@@ eches on their wa@@ ists ; they shall not clo@@ the themselves with [ anything that causes ] swe@@ at .
they shall te@@ ach my people the difference between the hol@@ y and the common , and cause them to dis@@ cer@@ n between the un@@ clean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ord@@ inan@@ ces shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my stat@@ utes in all my appointed fe@@ asts ; and they shall make my Sab@@ ba@@ ths hol@@ y .
in the day that he goes into the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , into the in@@ ner court , to minister in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , he shall offer his sin offering , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
of this there shall be for the hol@@ y place five hundred [ in length ] by five hundred [ in b@@ read@@ th ] , square all around ; and fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts for its subur@@ bs all around .
in the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel : and my pr@@ inces shall no more op@@ press my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tri@@ bes .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the b@@ ath shall be of one measure , that the b@@ ath may contain the tenth part of a Ho@@ mer , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of a Ho@@ mer : its measure shall be after the Ho@@ mer .
this is the offering that you shall offer : the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h from a Ho@@ mer of wheat ; and you shall give the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h from a Ho@@ mer of bar@@ ley ;
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h ; and you shall cleans@@ e the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who err@@ s , and for him who is simple : so you shall make At@@ on@@ ement for the house .
in the first [ month ] , in the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th day of the month , you shall have the P@@ ass@@ over , a feast of seven days ; un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread shall be e@@ aten .
the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h , seven bul@@ ls and seven r@@ ams without ble@@ mis@@ h daily the seven days ; and a male go@@ at daily for a sin offering .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram ; they shall be without ble@@ mis@@ h :
and he shall prepare a me@@ al offering , an ep@@ ha@@ h for the bul@@ l , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for the ram , and for the lam@@ bs according as he is able , and a hin of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
the pr@@ ince , when they go in , shall go in with of them ; and when they go out , he shall go out .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y rooms for the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and be@@ hold , there was a place on the hin@@ der part w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , and caused me to pass by the four cor@@ ners of the court ; and be@@ hold , in every cor@@ ner of the court there was a court .
when the man went forth eas@@ tw@@ ard with the line in his hand , he meas@@ ured one thousand cu@@ bi@@ ts , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the an@@ k@@ les .
after@@ ward he meas@@ ured one thousand ; [ and it was ] a river that I could not pass through ; for the waters were risen , waters to sw@@ im in , a river that could not be passed through .
now when I had returned , be@@ hold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : this shall be the border , by which you shall divide the land for inher@@ it@@ ance according to the twelve tri@@ bes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] por@@ tions .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of H@@ eth@@ lon , to the entrance of Z@@ ed@@ ad ;
Ham@@ ath , Ber@@ o@@ th@@ ah , Si@@ bra@@ im , which is between the border of Dam@@ as@@ cus and the border of Ham@@ ath ; Haz@@ er Hat@@ tic@@ on , which is by the border of H@@ aur@@ an .
the south side sou@@ th@@ ward shall be from Tam@@ ar as far as the waters of Mer@@ i@@ both K@@ ade@@ sh , to the Bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side sou@@ th@@ ward .
the west side shall be the great sea , from the [ south ] border as far as over against the entrance of Ham@@ ath . this is the west side .
[ it shall be ] for the pri@@ ests who are sanc@@ ti@@ fied of the sons of Zad@@ ok , who have kept my in@@ struction , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go as@@ tra@@ y when the children of Israel went as@@ tra@@ y , as the L@@ evi@@ tes went as@@ tra@@ y .
by the border of G@@ ad , at the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , the border shall be even from Tam@@ ar to the waters of Mer@@ ib@@ ath K@@ ade@@ sh , to the Bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one ; the gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , with their three gates : the gate of G@@ ad , one ; the gate of As@@ her , one ; the gate of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , one .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties , and of the wine which he d@@ rank , and that they should be no@@ ur@@ ished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the you@@ ths who eat of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the pr@@ ince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s brought them in before Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar .
in every matter of wis@@ dom and understanding , concerning which the king inqu@@ ired of them , he found them ten times better than all the mag@@ ic@@ ians and en@@ chan@@ ters who were in all his real@@ m .
in the second year of the reign of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar dre@@ amed dre@@ ams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sle@@ ep went from him .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the en@@ chan@@ ters , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , to tell the king his dre@@ ams . so they came in and stood before the king .
the king answ@@ ered the Chal@@ de@@ ans , The thing is gone from me : if you don '@@ t make known to me the dream and its interpre@@ tation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a d@@ un@@ gh@@ ill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the go@@ ds , whose d@@ wel@@ ling is not with f@@ les@@ h .
for this cause the king was angry and very fur@@ ious , and comman@@ ded to destroy all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
then Daniel returned answer with coun@@ sel and pru@@ dence to Ari@@ o@@ ch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on ;
Daniel went in , and desi@@ red of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpre@@ tation .
he changes the times and the se@@ as@@ ons ; he re@@ moves kings , and sets up kings ; he gives wis@@ dom to the wise , and knowledge to those who have understanding ;
but there is a God in heav@@ en who reve@@ als secre@@ ts , and he has made known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
you , O king , saw , and be@@ hold , a great image . this image , which was m@@ igh@@ ty , and whose bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness was excellent , stood before you ; and its aspect was aw@@ es@@ ome .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its bre@@ ast and its arms of silver , its bel@@ ly and its th@@ igh@@ s of br@@ ass ,
you , O king , are king of kings , to whom the God of heav@@ en has given the k@@ ing@@ dom , the power , and the strength , and the gl@@ ory ;
and wher@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
the fourth k@@ ing@@ dom shall be strong as iron , because iron breaks in pieces and sub@@ du@@ es all things ; and as iron that cr@@ us@@ hes all these , shall it break in pieces and cr@@ ush .
the king answ@@ ered to Daniel , and said , O@@ f a truth your God is the God of go@@ ds , and the Lord of kings , and a reve@@ al@@ er of secre@@ ts , since you have been able to reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king made an image of gold , whose he@@ ight was six@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and its b@@ read@@ th six cu@@ bi@@ ts : he set it up in the pla@@ in of D@@ ura , in the province of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
and who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the mid@@ st of a burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
he comman@@ ded certain m@@ igh@@ ty men who were in his army to bin@@ d Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , Mes@@ h@@ ach , and Ab@@ ed@@ ne@@ go , [ and ] to cast them into the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
then these men were bound in their p@@ ants , their tun@@ ics , and their man@@ t@@ les , and their [ other ] gar@@ ments , and were cast into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
I saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the th@@ ou@@ ghts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the en@@ chan@@ ters , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpre@@ tation .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and be@@ hold , a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th ; and its he@@ ight was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and its he@@ ight reached to the sky , and its sight to the end of all the ear@@ th .
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let an animal 's heart be given to him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that you saw , which grew , and was strong , whose he@@ ight reached to the sky , and its sight to all the ear@@ th ;
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your gre@@ at@@ ness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your domin@@ ion to the end of the ear@@ th .
whereas they comman@@ ded to leave the st@@ um@@ p of the roots of the tree ; your k@@ ing@@ dom shall be sure to you , after that you shall have known that the heav@@ ens do rule .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Bab@@ yl@@ on , which I have built for the royal d@@ wel@@ ling place , by the might of my power and for the gl@@ ory of my maj@@ es@@ ty ?
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to you it is spoken : the k@@ ing@@ dom has depar@@ ted from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of God 's house which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king and his lor@@ ds , his wi@@ ves and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank from them .
they d@@ rank wine , and praised the go@@ ds of gold , and of silver , of br@@ ass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth the fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lam@@ p@@ stand on the plas@@ ter of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his th@@ ou@@ ghts troubled him ; and the join@@ ts of his th@@ igh@@ s were lo@@ os@@ ened , and his k@@ ne@@ es struck one against another .
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the go@@ ds is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wis@@ dom are found in you .
Peres ; your k@@ ing@@ dom is divided , and given to the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans .
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with pur@@ ple , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the sat@@ ra@@ ps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole real@@ m .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans , which do@@ es@@ n '@@ t al@@ ter .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very disp@@ le@@ ased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he la@@ bo@@ red until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then these men assemb@@ led together to the king , and said to the king , K@@ now , O king , that it is a law of the Me@@ des and Per@@ si@@ ans , that no decree nor statute which the king establis@@ hes may be changed .
then the king comman@@ ded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of li@@ ons . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Y@@ our God whom you serve continu@@ ally , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the m@@ outh of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lor@@ ds ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sle@@ ep fled from him .
in the first year of Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
after this I saw , and be@@ hold , another , like a Le@@ op@@ ard , which had on its back four w@@ ings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and domin@@ ion was given to it .
a fi@@ ery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands minist@@ ered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Hor@@ n spoke ; I saw even until the animal was sla@@ in , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and be@@ hold , there came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was gri@@ ev@@ ed in the mid@@ st of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpre@@ tation of the things .
as for the ten hor@@ ns , out of this k@@ ing@@ dom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be di@@ verse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
in the third year of the reign of king Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar a vision appeared to me , even to me , Daniel , after that which appeared to me at the first .
as I was considering , be@@ hold , a male go@@ at came from the west over the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t touch the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two hor@@ ns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fur@@ y of his power .
the male go@@ at mag@@ ni@@ fied himself exce@@ ed@@ ingly : and when he was strong , the great Hor@@ n was broken ; and instead of it there came up four no@@ table [ hor@@ ns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
out of one of them came forth a little Hor@@ n , which grew exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the g@@ lor@@ ious [ land ] .
it grew great , even to the army of the sky ; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground , and tr@@ amp@@ led on them .
yes , it mag@@ ni@@ fied itself , even to the pr@@ ince of the army ; and it took away from him the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] through dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleas@@ ure ] and prosp@@ ered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
now as he was speaking with me , I fell into a deep sle@@ ep with my face toward the ground ; but he touched me , and set me u@@ pri@@ ght .
the roug@@ h male go@@ at is the king of Greece : and the great Hor@@ n that is between his eyes is the first king .
his power shall be m@@ igh@@ ty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy won@@ der@@ fully , and shall prosp@@ er and do [ his pleas@@ ure ] ; and he shall destroy the m@@ igh@@ ty ones and the hol@@ y people .
we have sin@@ ned , and have dealt per@@ ver@@ sely , and have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly , and have rebel@@ led , even turning aside from your prec@@ ep@@ ts and from your ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
neither have we list@@ ened to your servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
therefore has Yah@@ we@@ h watched over the ev@@ il , and brought it on us ; for Yah@@ we@@ h our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he does , and we have not obe@@ yed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and have gotten yo@@ ur@@ self ren@@ own , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and to his peti@@ tions , and cause your face to sh@@ ine on your sanc@@ tu@@ ary that is de@@ so@@ late , for the Lord 's sake .
yes , while I was speaking in pray@@ er , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
in the four and tw@@ enti@@ eth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is H@@ idde@@ kel ,
I lifted up my eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold , a man clo@@ th@@ ed in lin@@ en , whose th@@ igh@@ s were ad@@ or@@ ned with p@@ ure gold of U@@ p@@ haz :
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see the vision ; but a great qu@@ ak@@ ing fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sle@@ ep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me twenty @@@ -@@ @ one days ; but , be@@ hold , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was m@@ ute .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there bre@@ ath left in me .
then he said , " D@@ o you know why I have come to you ? now I will return to fight with the pr@@ ince of Per@@ sia . when I go forth , be@@ hold , the pr@@ ince of Greece shall come .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
his sons shall war , and shall assem@@ ble a multi@@ tude of great forces , which shall come on , and over@@ flow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a pr@@ ince shall cause the re@@ pro@@ ach offered by him to ce@@ ase ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his re@@ pro@@ ach to turn on him .
in his place shall stand up a con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble person , to whom they had not given the hon@@ or of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
after the treaty made with him he shall work dec@@ e@@ it@@ fully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yes , they who eat of his da@@ in@@ ties shall destroy him , and his army shall over@@ flow ; and many shall fall down sla@@ in .
as for both these kings , their hear@@ ts shall be to do mis@@ chief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosp@@ er ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great sub@@ stance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and he shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the fortress , and shall take away the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and they shall set up the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late .
such as do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly against the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant shall he per@@ ver@@ t by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ explo@@ its ] .
neither shall he regard the go@@ ds of his fa@@ thers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any go@@ d ; for he shall mag@@ ni@@ fy himself above all .
but in his place shall he hon@@ or the go@@ d of for@@ t@@ resses ; and a go@@ d whom his fa@@ thers di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know shall he hon@@ or with gold , and silver , and with pre@@ ci@@ ous stones , and pleas@@ ant things .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many [ countries ] shall be over@@ thrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt ; and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
those who are wise shall sh@@ ine as the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of the exp@@ ans@@ e ; and those who turn many to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as the stars fore@@ ver and ever .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and se@@ al the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and be@@ hold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
many shall pur@@ ify themselves , and make themselves white , and be refin@@ ed ; but the w@@ ic@@ ked shall do w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly ; and none of the w@@ ic@@ ked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
from the time that the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred n@@ in@@ ety days .
b@@ les@@ sed is he who waits , and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ five days .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to him , " C@@ all his name J@@ ez@@ reel ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ en@@ ge the blood of J@@ ez@@ reel on the house of J@@ eh@@ u , and will cause the k@@ ing@@ dom of the house of Israel to ce@@ ase .
conten@@ d with your mother ! conten@@ d , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ies from between her bre@@ asts ;
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and make her b@@ are as in the day that she was born , and make her like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and kill her with thir@@ st .
therefore be@@ hold , I will h@@ edge up your way with thor@@ ns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can '@@ t find her way .
for she did not know that I gave her the gra@@ in , the new wine , and the oil , and multi@@ p@@ lied to her silver and gold , which they used for Ba@@ al .
therefore I will take back my gra@@ in in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will p@@ lu@@ ck away my wo@@ ol and my fla@@ x which should have covered her nak@@ edn@@ ess .
now I will un@@ cover her le@@ w@@ d@@ ness in the sight of her lov@@ ers , and no one will deliver her out of my hand .
for I will take away the names of the Ba@@ als out of her m@@ outh , and they will no longer be mentioned by name .
I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me fore@@ ver . yes , I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , in justice , in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , and in comp@@ as@@ sion .
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without pr@@ ince , and without sacrifice , and without sac@@ red stone , and without ep@@ ho@@ d or id@@ ols .
hear the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , you children of Israel ; for Yah@@ we@@ h has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor Go@@ od@@ ness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore the land will mour@@ n , and everyone who d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in will waste aw@@ ay@@ . all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
you will st@@ um@@ ble in the day , and the pro@@ phe@@ t will also st@@ um@@ ble with you in the night ; and I will destroy your mother .
they will eat , and not have enough . they will play the pro@@ stitute , and will not increase ; because they have abandoned giving to Yah@@ we@@ h .
my people cons@@ ult with their wooden i@@ dol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them as@@ tra@@ y , and they have been un@@ fa@@ ith@@ ful to their God .
the wind has wrapped her up in its w@@ ings ; and they shall be disappointed because of their sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
their de@@ eds won '@@ t allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don '@@ t know Yah@@ we@@ h .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will become a de@@ so@@ lation in the day of re@@ bu@@ ke . among the tri@@ bes of Israel , I have made known that which will su@@ rely be .
" come , and let us return to Yah@@ we@@ h ; for he has torn us to pieces , and he will he@@ al us ; he has injured us , and he will bin@@ d up our wounds .
let us acknowledge Yah@@ we@@ h . let us press on to know Yah@@ we@@ h . as su@@ rely as the sun rises , Yah@@ we@@ h will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the ear@@ th . "
therefore I have cut them to pieces with the pro@@ ph@@ ets ; I killed them with the words of my m@@ outh . your judg@@ ments are like a f@@ lash of ligh@@ t@@ ning .
when I would he@@ al Israel , then the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is uncovered , also the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of Samar@@ ia ; for they commit fal@@ se@@ hood , and the th@@ i@@ ef enters in , and the gang of rob@@ bers rav@@ ages outside .
they don '@@ t consider in their hear@@ ts that I remember all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . now their own de@@ eds have eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ed them . they are before my face .
they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers . they are burning like an ov@@ en that the Bak@@ er stops s@@ tir@@ ring , from the k@@ ne@@ ading of the d@@ ough , until it is le@@ av@@ ened .
they are all hot as an ov@@ en , and dev@@ our their judges . all their kings have fallen . there is no one among them who calls to me .
S@@ tran@@ gers have dev@@ oured his strength , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it . indeed , gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s are here and there on him , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their Con@@ gre@@ gation has heard .
they ha@@ ven '@@ t cri@@ ed to me with their heart , but they ho@@ w@@ l on their beds . they assem@@ ble themselves for gra@@ in and new wine . they turn away from me .
for they so@@ w the wind , and they will re@@ ap the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind . he has no standing gra@@ in . the stal@@ k will yield no head . if it does yield , st@@ ran@@ gers will sw@@ allow it up .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the op@@ pression of the king of m@@ igh@@ ty ones .
they won '@@ t d@@ well in Yah@@ we@@ h 's land ; but E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will return to Egypt , and they will eat un@@ clean food in As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
what will you do in the day of so@@ lem@@ n assembly , and in the day of the feast of Yah@@ we@@ h ?
a pro@@ phe@@ t wat@@ ches over E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im with my God . a fo@@ w@@ ler 's sn@@ are is on all of his p@@ aths , and hos@@ tility in the house of his God .
though they bring up their children , yet I will ber@@ e@@ ave them , so that not a man shall be left . indeed , wo@@ e also to them when I de@@ part from them !
" all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in G@@ ilg@@ al ; for there I ha@@ ted them . because of the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their de@@ eds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their pr@@ inces are rebels .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is struck . their root has dri@@ ed up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the bel@@ ov@@ ed ones of their w@@ om@@ b . "
Israel is a lux@@ ur@@ i@@ ant v@@ ine that puts forth his fruit . according to the ab@@ und@@ ance of his fruit he has multi@@ p@@ lied his al@@ tar@@ s . as their land has prosp@@ ered , they have ad@@ or@@ ned their sac@@ red stones .
it also will be carried to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a for a present to a great king . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will receive sh@@ ame , and Israel will be as@@ ha@@ med of his own coun@@ sel .
when it is my desire , I will ch@@ as@@ tise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two trans@@ gres@@ sions .
you have p@@ low@@ ed w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . you have re@@ ap@@ ed in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity . you have e@@ aten the fruit of lies , for you tr@@ usted in your way , in the multi@@ tude of your m@@ igh@@ ty men .
therefore a battle ro@@ ar will arise among your people , and all your for@@ t@@ resses will be destroyed , as S@@ hal@@ man destroyed Beth Ar@@ bel in the day of battle . the mother was d@@ ashed in pieces with her children .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yok@@ e on their nec@@ ks ; and I b@@ ent down to him and I f@@ ed him .
I will not exec@@ ute the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of my an@@ ger . I will not return to destroy E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the mid@@ st of you ; and I will not come in wr@@ ath .
they will walk after Yah@@ we@@ h , who will ro@@ ar like a lion ; for he will ro@@ ar , and the children will come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling from the west .
they will come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" but I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you d@@ well in ten@@ ts , as in the days of the so@@ lem@@ n feast .
Jac@@ o@@ b fled into the country of Ara@@ m , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he ten@@ ded f@@ loc@@ ks and her@@ ds .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and like the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
according to their pas@@ ture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was ex@@ al@@ ted . therefore they have forgotten me .
I will meet them like a bear that is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of her c@@ ub@@ s , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will dev@@ our them like a li@@ on@@ ess . the wild animal will tear them .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman will come on him . he is an un@@ wise son ; for when it is time , he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come to the opening of the w@@ om@@ b .
Samar@@ ia will bear her guil@@ t ; for she has rebel@@ led against her God . they will fall by the s@@ word . their inf@@ ants will be d@@ ashed in pieces , and their pregn@@ ant women will be ri@@ pped open . "
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , what have I to do any more with id@@ ols ? I answer , and will take care of him . I am like a green f@@ ir tree ; from me your fruit is found . "
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his te@@ eth are the te@@ eth of a lion , and he has the fan@@ gs of a li@@ on@@ ess .
he has laid my v@@ ine waste , and stri@@ pped my fi@@ g tree . he has stri@@ pped its bar@@ k , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy a fast . call a so@@ lem@@ n assembly . gather the el@@ ders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , and cry to Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h , I cry to you , For the fire has dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and the fla@@ me has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field p@@ ant to you , for the water bro@@ oks have dri@@ ed up , An@@ d the fire has dev@@ oured the pas@@ tures of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
blow the tr@@ ump@@ et in Z@@ ion , and sound an alarm in my hol@@ y mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land tre@@ m@@ ble , for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire dev@@ ours before them , and behind them , a fla@@ me bur@@ ns . the land is as the gar@@ den of E@@ den before them , and behind them , a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
like the no@@ ise of char@@ i@@ ots on the tops of the mountains do they le@@ ap , like the no@@ ise of a fla@@ me of fire that dev@@ ours the st@@ ub@@ ble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they run like m@@ igh@@ ty men . they clim@@ b the wall like war@@ ri@@ ors . they each march in his line , and they don '@@ t sw@@ er@@ ve off course .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they clim@@ b up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like th@@ i@@ ev@@ es .
Yah@@ we@@ h th@@ unders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obe@@ ys his command ; for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is great and very aw@@ es@@ ome , and who can en@@ dur@@ e it ?
gather the people . San@@ c@@ ti@@ fy the assembly . assem@@ ble the el@@ ders . gather the children , and those who nur@@ se from bre@@ asts . let the bri@@ de@@ gro@@ om go forth from his room , and the bri@@ de out of her room .
Yah@@ we@@ h answ@@ ered his people , " be@@ hold , I will send you gra@@ in , new wine , and oil , and you will be satisfied with them ; and I will no more make you a re@@ pro@@ ach among the nations .
I will restore to you the years that the s@@ warming loc@@ ust has e@@ aten , the great loc@@ ust , the gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ per , and the cat@@ er@@ pil@@ lar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , who has dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the mid@@ st of Israel , and that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" for , be@@ hold , in those days , and in that time , when I restore the fortun@@ es of Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem ,
because you have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried my fin@@ est treasures into your temp@@ les ,
and have sold the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hands of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they will sell them to the men of She@@ ba , to a far@@ away nation , for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
" let the nations ar@@ o@@ use themselves , and come up to the val@@ ley of J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
Yah@@ we@@ h will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and Th@@ under from Jer@@ usalem ; and the heav@@ ens and the ear@@ th will shake ; but Yah@@ we@@ h will be a ref@@ uge to his people , and a stron@@ gh@@ old to the children of Israel .
Egypt will be a de@@ so@@ lation , and E@@ dom will be a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , for the violence done to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
he said : " Yah@@ we@@ h will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and ut@@ ter his voice from Jer@@ usalem ; and the pas@@ tures of the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds will mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ mel will wi@@ ther . "
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away cap@@ tive the whole community , to deliver them up to E@@ dom ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of T@@ y@@ re , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to E@@ dom , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember the bro@@ ther@@ ly C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ;
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it will dev@@ our its pal@@ aces , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind ;
but I will send a fire on Mo@@ a@@ b , and it will dev@@ our the pal@@ aces of Ker@@ i@@ o@@ th ; and Mo@@ a@@ b will die with t@@ um@@ ult , with sh@@ ou@@ ting , and with the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et ;
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righ@@ te@@ ous for silver , and the ne@@ edy for a pair of sho@@ es ;
they tr@@ amp@@ le on the d@@ ust of the ear@@ th on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the op@@ pressed ; and a man and his father use the same ma@@ iden , to prof@@ ane my hol@@ y name ;
and they lay themselves down bes@@ ide every alt@@ ar on clo@@ th@@ es taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you for@@ ty years in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , to poss@@ ess the land of the Am@@ or@@ ite .
I raised up some of your sons for pro@@ ph@@ ets , and some of your young men for Naz@@ iri@@ tes . Is@@ n '@@ t this true , you children of Israel ? " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
flight will per@@ ish from the swift ; and the strong won '@@ t strengthen his force ; neither shall the m@@ igh@@ ty deliver himself ;
neither shall he stand who hand@@ les the bo@@ w ; and he who is swift of fo@@ ot won '@@ t escape ; neither shall he who ri@@ des the hor@@ se deliver himself ;
hear this word that Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken against you , children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt , saying :
will a lion ro@@ ar in the th@@ ic@@ ket , when he has no pre@@ y ? does a young lion cry out of his den , if he has caught nothing ?
can a bird fall in a tra@@ p on the ear@@ th , where no sn@@ are is set for him ? does a sn@@ are spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
" for in the day that I visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel on him , I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l ; and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone stra@@ ight before her ; and you will cast yo@@ ur@@ selves into Har@@ mon , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" the vir@@ gin of Israel has fallen ; S@@ he shall rise no more . she is cast down on her land ; there is no one to raise her up . "
seek Yah@@ we@@ h , and you will live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and it dev@@ our , and there be no one to qu@@ en@@ ch it in Be@@ the@@ l .
for I know how many your offen@@ ses , and how great are your s@@ ins@@ -- you who aff@@ lic@@ t the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the ne@@ edy in the courts .
as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; O@@ r he went into the house and le@@ an@@ ed his hand on the wall , and a sn@@ ake bit him .
yes , though you offer me your bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and me@@ al offer@@ ings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offer@@ ings of your f@@ at animals .
take away from me the no@@ ise of your songs ! I will not listen to the music of your har@@ ps .
Wo@@ e to those who are at ease in Z@@ ion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samar@@ ia , the no@@ table men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
who lie on beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves on their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
" for , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ds , and the great house will be s@@ mas@@ hed to pieces , and the little house into bi@@ ts .
thus the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h showed me : and be@@ hold , he formed loc@@ ust@@ s in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and be@@ hold , it was the latter growth after the king 's har@@ v@@ est .
won '@@ t the land tre@@ m@@ ble for this , and everyone mour@@ n who d@@ wel@@ ls in it ? yes , it will rise up wh@@ ol@@ ly like the River ; and it will be s@@ tir@@ red up and s@@ ink again , like the River of Egypt .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will dar@@ ken the ear@@ th in the clear day .
be@@ hold , the days come , " says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " that I will send a fam@@ ine in the land , not a fam@@ ine of bread , nor a thir@@ st for water , but of hearing the words of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they will w@@ ander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , and will not find it .
though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enem@@ ies , there I will command the s@@ word , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for ev@@ il , and not for good .
be@@ hold , the eyes of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h are on the s@@ inf@@ ul k@@ ing@@ dom , and I will destroy it from off the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th ; except that I will not ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
" for , be@@ hold , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all the nations , as gra@@ in is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet not the least ker@@ nel will fall on the ear@@ th .
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
I will plant them on their land , and they will no more be p@@ lu@@ cked up out of their land which I have given them , " says Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
though you mount on high as the e@@ ag@@ le , and though your n@@ est is set among the stars , I will bring you down from there , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
but don '@@ t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction . D@@ on '@@ t speak pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .
D@@ on '@@ t enter into the gate of my people in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity . D@@ on '@@ t look down on their aff@@ li@@ ction in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity , neither se@@ ize their wealth on the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity .
D@@ on '@@ t stand in the cross@@ roads to cut off those of his who escape . D@@ on '@@ t deliver up those of his who remain in the day of dist@@ ress .
for as you have dr@@ un@@ k on my hol@@ y mountain , so will all the nations drink continu@@ ally . yes , they will drink , sw@@ allow down , and will be as though they had not been .
but Yah@@ we@@ h sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a m@@ igh@@ ty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stor@@ my .
nevertheless the men ro@@ wed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not , for the sea grew more and more stor@@ my against them .
for you threw me into the dep@@ ths , in the heart of the seas . the flood was all around me . all your waves and your bil@@ lows passed over me .
the people of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h believed God ; and they proclaimed a fast , and put on s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , from their greatest even to their least .
the news reached the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and took off his royal ro@@ be , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , both man and animal , and let them cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
therefore now , Yah@@ we@@ h , take , I be@@ g you , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live . "
then Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the sha@@ de , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yah@@ we@@ h God prepared a v@@ ine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a sha@@ de over his head , to deliver him from his dis@@ comfor@@ t . so Jon@@ ah was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad because of the v@@ ine .
the word of Yah@@ we@@ h that came to Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ ash@@ ti@@ te in the days of Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , which he saw concerning Samar@@ ia and Jer@@ usalem .
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O ear@@ th , and all that is there@@ in : and let the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h be witness against you , the Lord from his hol@@ y temp@@ le .
for , be@@ hold , Yah@@ we@@ h comes forth out of his place , and will come down and tre@@ ad on the high places of the ear@@ th .
har@@ ness the char@@ i@@ ot to the swift ste@@ ed , inhabi@@ tant of L@@ ach@@ ish . she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Z@@ ion ; For the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel were found in you .
s@@ have your heads , and cut off your ha@@ ir for the children of your de@@ light . en@@ large your bal@@ d@@ ness like the vul@@ ture ; for they have gone into cap@@ tivity from you !
Wo@@ e to those who dev@@ ise in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and work ev@@ il on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they c@@ ov@@ et fields , and se@@ ize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
you drive the women of my people out from their pleas@@ ant houses ; from their young children you take away my b@@ les@@ sing fore@@ ver .
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Yah@@ we@@ h at their head .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them , and break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then they will cry to Yah@@ we@@ h , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their de@@ eds ev@@ il . "
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not div@@ ine ; and the sun will go down on the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day will be black over them .
the se@@ ers shall be disappointed , and the di@@ vin@@ ers con@@ founded . yes , they shall all cover their li@@ ps ; for there is no answer from God . "
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jac@@ o@@ b his dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and to Israel his sin .
ple@@ ase listen to this , you heads of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and rul@@ ers of the house of Israel , who ab@@ h@@ or justice , and per@@ ver@@ t all equ@@ ity .
therefore Z@@ ion for your sake will be p@@ low@@ ed like a field , and Jer@@ usalem will become he@@ aps of rub@@ ble , and the mountain of the temp@@ le like the high places of a forest .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and peoples will stream to it .
but they will sit every man under his v@@ ine and under his fi@@ g tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the m@@ outh of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies has spoken .
indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their go@@ ds ; but we will walk in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h our God fore@@ ver and ever .
you , to@@ wer of the flock , the hill of the daughter of Z@@ ion , to you it will come , yes , the former domin@@ ion will come , the k@@ ing@@ dom of the daughter of Jer@@ usalem .
now you shall gather yo@@ ur@@ self in troops , daughter of troops . he has laid siege against us . they will strike the judge of Israel with a ro@@ d on the che@@ ek .
he shall stand , and shall she@@ ph@@ er@@ d in the strength of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the ear@@ th .
he will be our peace when As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches through our for@@ t@@ resses , then we will raise against him seven she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a with the s@@ word , and the land of N@@ im@@ ro@@ d in its gates . he will deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , when he inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches within our border .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Jac@@ o@@ b will be in the mid@@ st of many peoples , like dew from Yah@@ we@@ h , like sho@@ wers on the gr@@ ass , that don '@@ t wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
I will cut off your en@@ gra@@ ved images and your pil@@ lars out of your mid@@ st ; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands .
listen now to what Yah@@ we@@ h says : " arise , p@@ lead your case before the mountains , and let the hil@@ ls hear what you have to say .
therefore I also have struck you with a gri@@ ev@@ ous wo@@ und . I have made you de@@ so@@ late because of your sin@@ s .
you will so@@ w , but won '@@ t re@@ ap . you will tre@@ ad the ol@@ ives , but won '@@ t ano@@ int yo@@ ur@@ self with oil ; and cr@@ ush grap@@ es , but won '@@ t drink the wine .
the go@@ dly man has per@@ ished out of the ear@@ th , and there is no one u@@ pri@@ ght among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hun@@ ts his brother with a net .
D@@ on '@@ t trust in a neigh@@ bor . D@@ on '@@ t put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your em@@ br@@ ace , be careful of the words of your m@@ outh !
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
but as for me , I will look to Yah@@ we@@ h . I will wait for the God of my sal@@ vation . my God will hear me .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of Yah@@ we@@ h , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ leads my case , and execu@@ tes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
in that day they will come to you from As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt even to the River , and from sea to sea , and mountain to mountain .
" as in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt , I will show them mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous things . "
the nations will see and be as@@ ha@@ med of all their might . they will lay their hand on their m@@ outh . their e@@ ars will be de@@ af .
they will lick the d@@ ust like a ser@@ p@@ ent . like cra@@ w@@ ling things of the ear@@ th they shall come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling out of their den@@ s . they will come with fear to Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and will be afraid because of you .
he will again have comp@@ as@@ sion on us . he will tre@@ ad our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities under fo@@ ot ; and you will cast all their sin@@ s into the dep@@ ths of the sea .
Yah@@ we@@ h is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty un@@ punished . Yah@@ we@@ h has his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .
he re@@ bu@@ kes the sea , and makes it d@@ ry , and dri@@ es up all the rivers . B@@ ash@@ an langu@@ is@@ hes , and Car@@ mel ; and the f@@ lower of Lebanon langu@@ is@@ hes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hil@@ ls mel@@ t away . the ear@@ th tre@@ m@@ bles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who d@@ well in it .
who can stand before his in@@ dign@@ ation ? who can en@@ dur@@ e the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his an@@ ger ? his wr@@ ath is p@@ oured out like fire , and the ro@@ cks are broken apart by him .
Yah@@ we@@ h is good , a stron@@ gh@@ old in the day of trouble ; and he knows those who take ref@@ uge in him .
but with an over@@ flow@@ ing flood , he will make a full end of her place , and will pursue his enem@@ ies into d@@ ark@@ ness .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have aff@@ lic@@ ted you , I will aff@@ lic@@ t you no more .
the shield of his m@@ igh@@ ty men is made red . the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let . the char@@ i@@ ots f@@ lash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the p@@ ine spe@@ ars are br@@ and@@ ished .
it is decre@@ ed : she is uncovered , she is carried away ; and her hand@@ ma@@ ids mo@@ an as with the voice of d@@ ov@@ es , beating on their bre@@ asts .
take the sp@@ oil of silver . take the sp@@ oil of gold , for there is no end of the store , the gl@@ ory of all good@@ ly furniture .
the lion t@@ ore in pieces enough for his c@@ ub@@ s , and st@@ ran@@ g@@ led for his li@@ on@@ esses , and filled his c@@ aves with the kill , and his den@@ s with pre@@ y .
are you better than No @@@ -@@ @ Am@@ on , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose ram@@ part was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
all your for@@ t@@ resses will be like fi@@ g trees with the first @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ pe fig@@ s : if they are shaken , they fall into the m@@ outh of the e@@ ater .
" look among the nations , watch , and wonder mar@@ v@@ el@@ ously ; for I am working a work in your days , which you will not believe though it is told you .
for , be@@ hold , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and has@@ ty nation , that march through the b@@ read@@ th of the ear@@ th , to poss@@ ess d@@ wel@@ ling places that are not the@@ ir@@ s .
their hor@@ ses also are swi@@ f@@ ter than le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening w@@ ol@@ ves . their hor@@ se@@ men press pro@@ u@@ dly on . yes , their hor@@ se@@ men come from af@@ ar . they fly as an e@@ ag@@ le that hur@@ ries to dev@@ our .
yes , he sco@@ ffs at kings , and pr@@ inces are a der@@ ision to him . he la@@ ug@@ h@@ s at every stron@@ gh@@ old , for he buil@@ ds up an ear@@ then ram@@ p , and takes it .
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the cre@@ eping things , that have no ru@@ ler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the ho@@ ok . he cat@@ ches them in his net , and ga@@ thers them in his dra@@ g@@ net . therefore he re@@ jo@@ ices and is glad .
therefore he sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es to his net , and bur@@ ns incen@@ se to his dra@@ g@@ net , because by them his life is lux@@ ur@@ ious , and his food is good .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ram@@ parts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hur@@ ries toward the end , and won '@@ t prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will su@@ rely come . it won '@@ t delay .
Wo@@ e to him who gets an ev@@ il gain for his house , that he may set his n@@ est on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of ev@@ il !
for the stone will cry out of the wall , and the be@@ am out of the wo@@ od@@ work will answer it .
" Wo@@ e to him who gives his neigh@@ bor drink , po@@ uring your inf@@ laming wine until they are dr@@ un@@ k , so that you may gaz@@ e at their nak@@ ed bodies !
the sun and moon stood still in the sky , at the light of your ar@@ ro@@ ws as they went , at the sh@@ ining of your g@@ lit@@ tering spe@@ ar .
you went forth for the sal@@ vation of your people , for the sal@@ vation of your ano@@ in@@ ted . you cr@@ us@@ hed the head of the land of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . you stri@@ pped them head to fo@@ ot . Se@@ lah .
you pi@@ er@@ ced the heads of his war@@ ri@@ ors with their own spe@@ ars . they came as a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind to sc@@ at@@ ter me , glo@@ ating as if to dev@@ our the w@@ ret@@ ched in secret .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is at hand . for Yah@@ we@@ h has prepared a sacrifice . he has consec@@ rated his guests .
their wealth will become a sp@@ oil , and their houses a de@@ so@@ lation . yes , they will build houses , but won '@@ t in@@ ha@@ bit them . they will plant v@@ ine@@ yards , but won '@@ t drink their wine .
seek Yah@@ we@@ h , all you hum@@ ble of the land , who have kept his ord@@ inan@@ ces . seek righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness . seek hum@@ il@@ ity . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Yah@@ we@@ h 's an@@ ger .
Yah@@ we@@ h will be aw@@ es@@ ome to them , for he will fam@@ ish all the go@@ ds of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the sho@@ res of the nations .
she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice . she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive correc@@ tion . she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t trust in Yah@@ we@@ h . she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw near to her God .
but I will leave in the mid@@ st of you an aff@@ lic@@ ted and poor people , and they will take ref@@ uge in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h .
the re@@ mn@@ ant of Israel will not do in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies , neither will a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful ton@@ gue be found in their m@@ outh , for they will fe@@ ed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
in that day , it will be said to Jer@@ usalem , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , Z@@ ion . D@@ on '@@ t let your hands be weak . "
in the seventh month , in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ first day of the month , the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
" speak now to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of She@@ al@@ ti@@ el , governor of Ju@@ da@@ h , and to Jos@@ hua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est , and to the re@@ mn@@ ant of the people , saying ,
this is the word that I c@@ ov@@ en@@ anted with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spiri@@ t lived among you . ' D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . '
for this is what Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies says : ' yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heav@@ ens , the ear@@ th , the sea , and the d@@ ry land ;
in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came by Hag@@ ga@@ i the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,

the Wor@@ d of Yah@@ we@@ h came the second time to Hag@@ ga@@ i in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the month , saying ,
in the eighth month , in the second year of Dar@@ i@@ us , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of I@@ d@@ do , the pro@@ phe@@ t , saying ,
therefore tell them : thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies : ' return to me , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , ' and I will return to you , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
they reported to the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h who stood among the m@@ yr@@ tle trees , and said , " We have walked back and forth through the ear@@ th , and be@@ hold , all the ear@@ th is at rest and in peace . "
for I , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' will be to her a wall of fire around it , and I will be the gl@@ ory in the mid@@ st of her .
many nations shall join themselves to Yah@@ we@@ h in that day , and shall be my people ; and I will d@@ well in the mid@@ st of you , and you shall know that Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies has sent me to you .
I said , " Let them set a clean tur@@ ban on his head . " so they set a clean tur@@ ban on his head , and clo@@ th@@ ed him ; and the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h was standing by .
the an@@ gel who talked with me came again , and w@@ ak@@ ened me , as a man who is w@@ ak@@ ened out of his sle@@ ep .
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are bes@@ ide the two golden sp@@ outs , that p@@ our the golden oil out of themselves ? "
( and be@@ hold , a tal@@ ent of lead was lifted up ) ; and this is a woman sitting in the mid@@ st of the ep@@ ha@@ h bas@@ ket . "
the one with the black hor@@ ses goes out toward the north country ; and the white went out after them ; and the d@@ app@@ led went forth toward the south country . "
the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the ear@@ th : and he said , " G@@ o around and through the ear@@ th ! " so they walked back and forth through the ear@@ th .
" take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ da@@ i , of To@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , and of J@@ ed@@ ai@@ ah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Jos@@ i@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , where they have come from Bab@@ yl@@ on .
yes , take silver and gold , and make crow@@ ns , and set them on the head of Jos@@ hua the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high pri@@ est ;

it has come to pass that , as he called , and they refused to listen , so they will call , and I will not listen , " said Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies ;
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neigh@@ bor . exec@@ ute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
an or@@ acle . the word of Yah@@ we@@ h is against the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and will rest upon Dam@@ as@@ cus ; for the eye of man and of all the tri@@ bes of Israel is toward Yah@@ we@@ h ;
Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will wri@@ the in ag@@ ony ; as will E@@ kr@@ on , for her expec@@ tation will be disappointed ; and the king will per@@ ish from Gaza , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on will not be inhabited .
I will en@@ camp around my house against the army , that none pass through or return ; and no op@@ pres@@ sor will pass through them any more : for now I have seen with my eyes .
Yah@@ we@@ h will be seen over them ; and his ar@@ row will go f@@ lash like ligh@@ t@@ ning ; and the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will blow the tr@@ ump@@ et , and will go with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
Yah@@ we@@ h their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the je@@ wel@@ s of a cro@@ wn , lifted on high over his land .
for how great is his Go@@ od@@ ness , and how great is his beauty ! gra@@ in will make the young men flo@@ ur@@ ish , and new wine the vir@@ g@@ ins .
they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , t@@ reading down mu@@ d@@ dy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yah@@ we@@ h is with them ; and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses will be con@@ founded .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Lebanon ; and there won '@@ t be room enough for them .
I said to them , " If you think it best , give me my wages ; and if not , keep them . " so they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver .
an or@@ acle . the word of Yah@@ we@@ h concerning Israel . Yah@@ we@@ h , who stret@@ ches out the heav@@ ens , and lays the foundation of the ear@@ th , and forms the spirit of man within him says :
" be@@ hold , I will make Jer@@ usalem a c@@ up of re@@ el@@ ing to all the surrounding peoples , and on Ju@@ da@@ h also will it be in the siege against Jer@@ usalem .
in that day Yah@@ we@@ h will defend the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem . he who is fe@@ e@@ ble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jer@@ usalem .
it will happen in that day , that the pro@@ ph@@ ets will each be as@@ ha@@ med of his vision , when he pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ies ; neither will they wear a ha@@ iry man@@ tle to dec@@ e@@ ive :
but he will say , ' I am no pro@@ phe@@ t , I am a til@@ ler of the ground ; for I have been made a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant from my youth . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Yah@@ we@@ h , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
it will be a unique day which is known to Yah@@ we@@ h ; not day , and not night ; but it will come to pass , that at evening time there will be light .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yah@@ we@@ h will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neigh@@ bor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neigh@@ bor .
Ju@@ da@@ h also will fight at Jer@@ usalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clo@@ thing , in great ab@@ und@@ ance .
so will be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the don@@ key , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that pla@@ gue .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jer@@ usalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , and to keep the feast of ten@@ ts .
it will be , that who@@ ever of all the families of the ear@@ th do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go up to Jer@@ usalem to worship the King , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , on them there will be no rain .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don '@@ t go up to keep the feast of ten@@ ts .
" but you prof@@ ane it , in that you say , ' Yah@@ we@@ h 's table is pollu@@ ted , and its fruit , even its food , is con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble . '
be@@ hold , I will re@@ bu@@ ke your se@@ ed , and will spread D@@ ung on your faces , even the D@@ ung of your fe@@ asts ; and you will be taken away with it .
" my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be rever@@ ent toward me ; and he was rever@@ ent toward me , and stood in a@@ we of my name .
Ju@@ da@@ h has dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , and an ab@@ omin@@ ation is committed in Israel and in Jer@@ usalem ; for Ju@@ da@@ h has prof@@ an@@ ed the hol@@ iness of Yah@@ we@@ h which he lov@@ es , and has married the daughter of a foreign go@@ d .
Yah@@ we@@ h will cut off , to the man who does this , him who w@@ akes and him who answers , out of the ten@@ ts of Jac@@ o@@ b , and him who offers an offering to Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
yet you say , ' Wh@@ y ? ' because Yah@@ we@@ h has been witness between you and the wife of your youth , against whom you have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously , though she is your compan@@ ion , and the wife of your C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant .
I will re@@ bu@@ ke the dev@@ ou@@ rer for your sak@@ es , and he shall not destroy the fru@@ its of your ground ; neither shall your v@@ ine cast its fruit before its time in the field , " says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies .
he will turn the hear@@ ts of the fa@@ thers to the children , and the hear@@ ts of the children to their fa@@ thers , lest I come and strike the ear@@ th with a cur@@ se . "
now the birth of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregn@@ ant by the Holy Spiri@@ t .
" be@@ hold , the vir@@ gin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son . they shall call his name Im@@ man@@ uel " ; which is , being interpreted , " God with us . "
Joseph ar@@ ose from his sle@@ ep , and did as the an@@ gel of the Lord comman@@ ded him , and took his wife to himself ;
'@@ You B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem , land of Ju@@ da@@ h , are in no way least among the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall she@@ ph@@ er@@ d my people , Israel . ' "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and be@@ hold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary , his mother , and they fell down and wor@@ shi@@ ped him . opening their treasures , they offered to him gifts : gold , fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and m@@ yr@@ r@@ h .
but when he heard that Ar@@ che@@ laus was re@@ ig@@ ning over Ju@@ de@@ a in the place of his father , Her@@ od , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Gal@@ il@@ ee ,
" even now the ax@@ e lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
the people who sat in d@@ ark@@ ness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has da@@ w@@ ned . "
walk@@ ing by the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , he saw two brothers : Simon , who is called Peter , and An@@ drew , his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fisher@@ men .
going on from there , he saw two other brothers , James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John his brother , in the boat with Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e their father , men@@ ding their n@@ ets . he called them .
the report about him went out into all Syria . they brought to him all who were si@@ ck , aff@@ lic@@ ted with various diseases and tor@@ ments , poss@@ essed with dem@@ ons , ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tics , and paral@@ y@@ tics ; and he he@@ aled them .
seeing the multi@@ tu@@ des , he went up onto the mountain . when he had sat down , his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him .
neither do you light a lam@@ p , and put it under a measuring bas@@ ket , but on a stand ; and it sh@@ ines to all who are in the house .
for I tell you that unless your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness exceeds that of the s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en .
" you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones , ' You shall not murder ; ' and ' W@@ ho@@ ever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment . '
agree with your ad@@ versary quickly , while you are with him in the way ; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge , and the judge deliver you to the officer , and you be cast into prison .
" it was also said , ' W@@ ho@@ ever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of div@@ or@@ ce , '
but let your ' Y@@ es ' be ' Y@@ es ' and your ' No ' be ' No . ' whatever is more than these is of the ev@@ il one .
but I tell you , love your enem@@ ies , b@@ less those who cur@@ se you , do good to those who h@@ ate you , and pra@@ y for those who mist@@ re@@ at you and persec@@ ute you ,
" be careful that you don '@@ t do your char@@ itable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en .
but you , when you pra@@ y , enter into your in@@ ner room , and having shut your door , pra@@ y to your F@@ ather who is in secret , and your F@@ ather who sees in secret will reward you openly .
so that you are not seen by men to be fas@@ ting , but by your F@@ ather who is in secret , and your F@@ ather , who sees in secret , will reward you .
but if your eye is ev@@ il , your whole body will be full of d@@ ark@@ ness . if therefore the light that is in you is d@@ ark@@ ness , how great is the d@@ ark@@ ness !
but if God so clo@@ th@@ es the gr@@ ass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the ov@@ en , won '@@ t he much more clo@@ the you , you of little faith ?
" therefore don '@@ t be anx@@ ious , saying , ' What will we eat ? ' , ' What will we drink ? ' or , ' With what will we be clo@@ th@@ ed ? '
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be jud@@ ged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be meas@@ ured to you .
why do you see the spec@@ k that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the be@@ am that is in your own eye ?
or how will you tell your brother , ' Let me remove the spec@@ k from your eye ; ' and be@@ hold , the be@@ am is in your own eye ?
" D@@ on '@@ t give that which is hol@@ y to the do@@ gs , neither throw your pe@@ ar@@ ls before the p@@ ig@@ s , lest perhaps they tr@@ amp@@ le them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
or who is there among you , who , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
if you then , being ev@@ il , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en give good things to those who ask him !
" enter in by the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction , and many are those who enter in by it .
" everyone therefore who he@@ ars these words of mine , and does them , I will lik@@ en him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
the rain came down , the floods came , and the winds ble@@ w , and beat on that house ; and it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fall , for it was founded on the rock .
everyone who he@@ ars these words of mine , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do them will be like a fo@@ ol@@ ish man , who built his house on the s@@ and .
he said to them , " Wh@@ y are you fear@@ ful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , re@@ bu@@ ked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
those who f@@ ed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , including what happened to those who were poss@@ essed with dem@@ ons .
when J@@ es@@ us heard it , he said to them , " Those who are healthy have no need for a physi@@ cian , but those who are si@@ ck do .
J@@ es@@ us went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their syn@@ ago@@ gues , and pre@@ aching the Go@@ od News of the Kingdom , and he@@ aling every disease and every si@@ ck@@ ness among the people .
but when he saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , he was moved with comp@@ as@@ sion for them , because they were har@@ ass@@ ed and sc@@ at@@ tered , like she@@ ep without a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
J@@ es@@ us sent these twelve out , and comman@@ ded them , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t go among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , and don '@@ t enter into any city of the Samar@@ it@@ ans .
who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive you , nor hear your words , as you go out of that house or that city , shake off the d@@ ust from your feet .
but be@@ w@@ are of men : for they will deliver you up to coun@@ cils , and in their syn@@ ago@@ gues they will s@@ cour@@ ge you .
but when they deliver you up , don '@@ t be anx@@ ious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
it is enough for the dis@@ cip@@ le that he be like his teacher , and the ser@@ vant like his lor@@ d . if they have called the master of the house Be@@ el@@ z@@ e@@ bul , how much more those of his household !
what I tell you in the d@@ ark@@ ness , speak in the light ; and what you hear wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in the e@@ ar , procla@@ im on the hous@@ et@@ ops .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
who@@ ever gives one of these little ones just a c@@ up of cold water to drink in the name of a dis@@ cip@@ le , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
the b@@ lin@@ d receive their sight , the la@@ me walk , the le@@ pers are cleans@@ ed , the de@@ af hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have good news pre@@ ached to them .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
most certainly I tell you , among those who are born of women there has not ar@@ isen anyone greater than John the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ zer ; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is greater than he .
you , Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , who are ex@@ al@@ ted to heav@@ en , you will go down to H@@ ades . for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works had been done in So@@ dom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
but I tell you that it will be more toler@@ able for the land of So@@ dom , on the day of judgment , than for you . "
take my yok@@ e upon you , and learn from me , for I am g@@ ent@@ le and low@@ ly in heart ; and you will find rest for your so@@ ul@@ s .
at that time , J@@ es@@ us went on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day through the gra@@ in fields . his dis@@ cip@@ les were hun@@ gry and began to p@@ lu@@ ck heads of gra@@ in and to eat .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and pl@@ under his goods , unless he first bin@@ d the strong man ? then he will pl@@ under his house .
who@@ ever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be for@@ given him ; but who@@ ever speaks against the Holy Spiri@@ t , it will not be for@@ given him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
you off@@ spring of vi@@ pers , how can you , being ev@@ il , speak good things ? for out of the ab@@ und@@ ance of the heart , the m@@ outh speaks .
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things , and the ev@@ il man out of his ev@@ il treasure brings out ev@@ il things .
but the un@@ clean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through water@@ less places , seeking rest , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t find it .
then he says , ' I will return into my house from which I came out , ' and when he has come back , he finds it empty , swe@@ pt , and put in order .
others fell on ro@@ cky ground , where they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t have much soil , and immediately they sp@@ ran@@ g up , because they had no dep@@ th of ear@@ th .
in them the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; seeing you will see , and will in no way perce@@ ive :
for most certainly I tell you that many pro@@ ph@@ ets and righ@@ te@@ ous men desi@@ red to see the things which you see , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear them .
when anyone he@@ ars the word of the Kingdom , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t understand it , the ev@@ il one comes , and sn@@ at@@ ches away that which has been so@@ wn in his heart . this is what was so@@ wn by the road@@ side .
what was so@@ wn among the thor@@ ns , this is he who he@@ ars the word , but the car@@ es of this age and the dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful@@ ness of ri@@ ches ch@@ oke the word , and he becomes un@@ fruit@@ ful .
then J@@ es@@ us sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away , and went into the house . his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him , saying , " explain to us the par@@ able of the dar@@ nel we@@ eds of the field . "
the field is the world ; and the good se@@ ed , these are the children of the Kingdom ; and the dar@@ nel we@@ eds are the children of the ev@@ il one .
then the righ@@ te@@ ous will sh@@ ine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their F@@ ather . he who has e@@ ars to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a dra@@ g@@ net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered some fish of every kind ,
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into contain@@ ers , but the bad they threw away .
for Her@@ od had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Her@@ odi@@ as , his brother Philip 's wife .
the king was gri@@ ev@@ ed , but for the sake of his o@@ aths , and of those who sat at the table with him , he comman@@ ded it to be given ,
they all ate , and were filled . they took up twelve bas@@ kets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces .
after he had sent the multi@@ tu@@ des away , he went up into the mountain by himself to pra@@ y . when evening had come , he was there alone .
when the people of that place recogn@@ ized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were si@@ ck ,
and they beg@@ ged him that they might just touch the f@@ rin@@ ge of his gar@@ ment . as many as touched it were made whole .
you hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! well did I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y of you , saying ,
that which enters into the m@@ outh do@@ es@@ n '@@ t def@@ ile the man ; but that which proceeds out of the m@@ outh , this def@@ il@@ es the man . "
and he took the seven lo@@ aves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and the dis@@ cip@@ les to the multi@@ tu@@ des .
they all ate , and were filled . they took up seven bas@@ kets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
an ev@@ il and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the pro@@ phe@@ t Jon@@ ah . " he left them , and depar@@ ted .
then they understood that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell them to be@@ w@@ are of the ye@@ ast of bread , but of the teaching of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees and Sad@@ du@@ ce@@ es .
now when J@@ es@@ us came into the parts of Ca@@ es@@ area Philip@@ pi , he asked his dis@@ cip@@ les , saying , " Wh@@ o do men say that I , the Son of Man , am ? "
I will give to you the ke@@ ys of the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en , and whatever you bin@@ d on ear@@ th will have been bound in heav@@ en ; and whatever you release on ear@@ th will have been released in heav@@ en . "
from that time , J@@ es@@ us began to show his dis@@ cip@@ les that he must go to Jer@@ usalem and suffer many things from the el@@ ders , chief pri@@ ests , and s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Gen@@ tile or a tax collec@@ tor .
again , assu@@ red@@ ly I tell you , that if two of you will agree on ear@@ th concerning anything that they will ask , it will be done for them by my F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en .
but because he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t pay , his lor@@ d comman@@ ded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the ser@@ vant therefore fell down and k@@ ne@@ eled before him , saying , ' Lord , have patience with me , and I will repay you all ! '
the lor@@ d of that ser@@ vant , being moved with comp@@ as@@ sion , released him , and for@@ gave him the debt .
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exce@@ ed@@ ingly sor@@ ry , and came and told to their lor@@ d all that was done .
it happened when J@@ es@@ us had finished these words , he depar@@ ted from Gal@@ il@@ ee , and came into the borders of Ju@@ de@@ a beyond the Jordan .
again I tell you , it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
" for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to h@@ ire labor@@ ers for his v@@ ine@@ yard .
take that which is yo@@ urs , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
Is@@ n '@@ t it law@@ ful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye ev@@ il , because I am good ? '
the multi@@ tu@@ des who went before him , and who followed kept sh@@ ou@@ ting , " Hos@@ anna to the son of David ! b@@ les@@ sed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hos@@ anna in the highest ! "
but when the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes saw the won@@ der@@ ful things that he did , and the children who were cr@@ ying in the temp@@ le and saying , " Hos@@ anna to the son of David ! " they were in@@ dign@@ ant ,
but the farmers , when they saw the son , said among themselves , ' This is the he@@ ir . come , let 's kill him , and se@@ ize his inher@@ it@@ ance . '
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered and spoke again in par@@ ables to them , saying ,
'@@ i am the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b ? ' God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . "
for they bin@@ d heavy bur@@ den@@ s that are gri@@ ev@@ ous to be bor@@ ne , and lay them on men 's sho@@ ul@@ ders ; but they themselves will not lift a fin@@ ger to help them .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fa@@ thers , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have been par@@ tak@@ ers with them in the blood of the pro@@ ph@@ ets . '
J@@ es@@ us went out from the temp@@ le , and was going on his way . his dis@@ cip@@ les came to him to show him the buildings of the temp@@ le .
but he answ@@ ered them , " You see all of these things , don '@@ t you ? most certainly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone on another , that will not be thrown down . "
for nation will rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom ; and there will be fam@@ ines , plagu@@ es , and earthquakes in various places .
" when , therefore , you see the ab@@ omin@@ ation of de@@ so@@ lation , which was spoken of through Daniel the pro@@ phe@@ t , standing in the hol@@ y place ( let the re@@ ader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shor@@ tened , no f@@ les@@ h would have been sav@@ ed . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shor@@ tened .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning fl@@ ashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the op@@ pression of those days , the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heav@@ ens will be shaken ;
he will send out his an@@ gel@@ s with a great sound of a tr@@ ump@@ et , and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from one end of the sky to the other .
" now from the fi@@ g tree learn this par@@ able . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were e@@ ating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ ah entered into the ship ,
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the th@@ i@@ ef was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" he also who had received the one tal@@ ent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , re@@ ap@@ ing where you did not so@@ w , and gathering where you did not sc@@ at@@ ter .
" but when the Son of Man comes in his gl@@ ory , and all the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s with him , then he will sit on the th@@ r@@ one of his gl@@ ory .
I was nak@@ ed , and you clo@@ th@@ ed me . I was si@@ ck , and you visited me . I was in prison , and you came to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' de@@ part from me , you Cur@@ sed , into the eter@@ nal fire which is prepared for the dev@@ il and his an@@ gel@@ s ;
then the chief pri@@ ests , the s@@ cri@@ bes , and the el@@ ders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high pri@@ est , who was called C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has .
most certainly I tell you , wher@@ ever this Go@@ od News is pre@@ ached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
the Son of Man goes , even as it is written of him , but wo@@ e to that man through whom the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
then he came to his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " S@@ le@@ ep on now , and take your rest . be@@ hold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed into the hands of sin@@ ners .
be@@ hold , one of those who were with J@@ es@@ us stret@@ ched out his hand , and drew his s@@ word , and struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and struck off his e@@ ar .
in that hour J@@ es@@ us said to the multi@@ tu@@ des , " H@@ ave you come out as against a rob@@ ber with s@@ words and clubs to se@@ ize me ? I sat daily in the temp@@ le teaching , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t arrest me .
then they sp@@ it in his face and beat him with their f@@ ists , and some sla@@ pped him ,
then Ju@@ das , who bet@@ ray@@ ed him , when he saw that J@@ es@@ us was condemned , felt re@@ mor@@ se , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief pri@@ ests and el@@ ders ,
the chief pri@@ ests took the pieces of silver , and said , " It 's not law@@ ful to put them into the treas@@ ury , since it is the price of blood . "
when they had mo@@ cked him , they took the ro@@ be off of him , and put his clo@@ th@@ es on him , and led him away to cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
those who passed by b@@ las@@ phe@@ med him , w@@ ag@@ ging their heads ,
immediately one of them ran , and took a spon@@ ge , and filled it with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a Re@@ ed , and gave him a drink .
be@@ hold , the ve@@ il of the temp@@ le was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the ear@@ th qu@@ aked and the ro@@ cks were split .
now the centur@@ ion , and those who were with him watching J@@ es@@ us , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , fear@@ ed exce@@ ed@@ ingly , saying , " T@@ rul@@ y this was the Son of God . "
Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean lin@@ en clo@@ th ,
be@@ hold , there was a great earthquake , for an an@@ gel of the Lord des@@ cen@@ ded from the sky , and came and rol@@ led away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
as they went to tell his dis@@ cip@@ les , be@@ hold , J@@ es@@ us met them , saying , " re@@ jo@@ ice ! " they came and took hold of his feet , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
now while they were going , be@@ hold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief pri@@ ests all the things that had happened .
now after John was taken into custody , J@@ es@@ us came into Gal@@ il@@ ee , pre@@ aching the Go@@ od News of the Kingdom of God ,
going on a little further from there , he saw James the son of Ze@@ be@@ de@@ e , and John , his brother , who were also in the boat men@@ ding the n@@ ets .
at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all who were si@@ ck , and those who were poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons .
a le@@ per came to him , beg@@ ging him , k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
when he had said this , immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy depar@@ ted from him , and he was made clean .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the ro@@ of where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the M@@ at that the paral@@ y@@ tic was lying on .
he ar@@ ose , and immediately took up the M@@ at , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amaz@@ ed , and gl@@ ori@@ fied God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
it happened , that he was rec@@ lining at the table in his house , and many tax collec@@ tors and sin@@ ners sat down with J@@ es@@ us and his dis@@ cip@@ les , for there were many , and they followed him .
no one se@@ ws a piece of un@@ sh@@ run@@ k clo@@ th on an old gar@@ ment , or else the pat@@ ch sh@@ rin@@ ks and the new te@@ ars away from the old , and a worse hol@@ e is made .
it happened that he was going on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day through the gra@@ in fields , and his dis@@ cip@@ les began , as they went , to p@@ lu@@ ck the e@@ ars of gra@@ in .
how he entered into God 's house when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar was high pri@@ est , and ate the show bread , which is not law@@ ful to eat except for the pri@@ ests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
he spoke to his dis@@ cip@@ les that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t press on him .
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to pl@@ under , unless he first bin@@ ds the strong man ; and then he will pl@@ under his house .
and it happened , as he so@@ wed , some se@@ ed fell by the road , and the birds came and dev@@ oured it .
others fell on the ro@@ cky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sp@@ ran@@ g up , because it had no dep@@ th of soil .
that ' seeing they may see , and not perce@@ ive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sin@@ s should be for@@ given them . ' "
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is so@@ wn ; and when they have heard , immediately S@@ atan comes , and takes away the word which has been so@@ wn in them .
those which were so@@ wn on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some six@@ ty times , and some one hundred times . "
for who@@ ever has , to him will more be given , and he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have , even that which he has will be taken away from him . "
because he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been torn apart by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to t@@ ame him .
always , night and day , in the tom@@ bs and in the mountains , he was cr@@ ying out , and cutting himself with stones .
those who f@@ ed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to J@@ es@@ us , and saw him who had been poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons sitting , clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legi@@ on ; and they were afraid .
when J@@ es@@ us had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multi@@ tude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
but the woman , fearing and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , kno@@ wing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
they ri@@ dic@@ uled him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
he could do no m@@ igh@@ ty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few si@@ ck people , and he@@ aled them .
but Her@@ od , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I be@@ headed . he has risen from the dead . "
the king was exce@@ ed@@ ingly sor@@ ry , but for the sake of his o@@ aths , and of his din@@ ner guests , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t wish to refuse her .
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard , and comman@@ ded to bring John 's head , and he went and be@@ headed him in the prison ,
the A@@ post@@ les gathered themselves together to J@@ es@@ us , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had ta@@ ught .
J@@ es@@ us came out , saw a great multi@@ tude , and he had comp@@ as@@ sion on them , because they were like she@@ ep without a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , and he began to te@@ ach them many things .
he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to heav@@ en , he b@@ les@@ sed and broke the lo@@ aves , and he gave to his dis@@ cip@@ les to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " che@@ er up ! it is I ! D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . "
he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ce@@ ased , and they were very amaz@@ ed among themselves , and mar@@ v@@ eled ;
now when they saw some of his dis@@ cip@@ les e@@ ating bread with def@@ iled , that is , un@@ was@@ hed , hands , they found fault .
( for the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , and all the Jews , don '@@ t eat unless they was@@ h their hands and fore@@ arms , holding to the tradition of the el@@ ders .
" for you set aside the comman@@ d@@ ment of God , and hold tigh@@ tly to the tradition of men@@ -@@ -@@ the w@@ ashing of pit@@ chers and c@@ ups , and you do many other such things . "
for Mos@@ es said , ' hon@@ or your father and your mother ; ' and , ' He who speaks ev@@ il of father or mother , let him be put to death . '
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can def@@ ile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that def@@ ile the man .
from there he ar@@ ose , and went away into the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on . he entered into a house , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t want anyone to know it , but he co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t escape no@@ tice .
she went away to her house , and found the child having been laid on the bed , with the dem@@ on gone out .
again he depar@@ ted from the borders of T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on , and came to the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , through the mid@@ st of the region of Dec@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
they brought to him one who was de@@ af and had an im@@ pedi@@ ment in his speech . they beg@@ ged him to lay his hand on him .
he comman@@ ded the multi@@ tude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven lo@@ aves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his dis@@ cip@@ les to serve , and they served the multi@@ tude .
he sent him away to his house , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
he began to te@@ ach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the el@@ ders , the chief pri@@ ests , and the s@@ cri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
he called the multi@@ tude to himself with his dis@@ cip@@ les , and said to them , " W@@ ho@@ ever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for who@@ ever wants to save his life will lose it ; and who@@ ever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Go@@ od News will save it .
after six days J@@ es@@ us took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain priv@@ ately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
as they were coming down from the mountain , he comman@@ ded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
for who@@ ever will give you a c@@ up of water to drink in my name , because you are Ch@@ r@@ ist 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
if your hand causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life ma@@ imed , rather than having your two hands to go into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire ,
if your fo@@ ot causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life la@@ me , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the fire that will never be qu@@ en@@ ch@@ ed@@ --
if your eye causes you to st@@ um@@ ble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire ,
for everyone will be sal@@ ted with fire , and every sacrifice will be se@@ as@@ oned with salt .
he ar@@ ose from there and came into the borders of Ju@@ de@@ a and beyond the Jordan . multi@@ tu@@ des came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
but when J@@ es@@ us saw it , he was moved with in@@ dign@@ ation , and said to them , " allow the little children to come to me ! D@@ on '@@ t for@@ bid them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to go through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
they said to him , " G@@ rant to us that we may sit , one at your right hand , and one at your left hand , in your gl@@ ory . "
when he heard that it was J@@ es@@ us the N@@ azar@@ ene , he began to cry out , and say , " J@@ es@@ us , you son of David , have mer@@ cy on me ! "
many spread their gar@@ ments on the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and spreading them on the road .
those who went in front , and those who followed , cri@@ ed out , " Hos@@ anna ! b@@ les@@ sed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
b@@ les@@ sed is the k@@ ing@@ dom of our father David that is coming in the name of the Lord ! Hos@@ anna in the highest ! "
he ta@@ ught , saying to them , " Is@@ n '@@ t it written , ' My house will be called a house of pray@@ er for all the nations ? ' but you have made it a den of rob@@ bers ! "
when it was time , he sent a ser@@ vant to the far@@ mer to get from the far@@ mer his share of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard .
again , he sent another ser@@ vant to them ; and they threw stones at him , wounded him in the head , and sent him away sha@@ me@@ fully treated .
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered them , " ren@@ der to Ca@@ es@@ ar the things that are Ca@@ es@@ ar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . " they mar@@ v@@ eled greatly at him .
for when they will rise from the dead , they neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage , but are like an@@ gel@@ s in heav@@ en .
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first comman@@ d@@ ment .
for David himself said in the Holy Spiri@@ t , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enem@@ ies the foot@@ st@@ ool of your feet . " '
for nation will rise against nation , and k@@ ing@@ dom against k@@ ing@@ dom . there will be earthquakes in various places . there will be fam@@ ines and troub@@ les . these things are the beginning of birth pain@@ s .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
you will be ha@@ ted by all men for my name 's sake , but he who en@@ du@@ res to the end , the same will be sav@@ ed .
then he will send out his an@@ gel@@ s , and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds , from the ends of the ear@@ th to the ends of the sky .
" now from the fi@@ g tree , learn this par@@ able . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also comman@@ ded the do@@ or@@ keep@@ er to keep watch .
it was now two days before the feast of the P@@ ass@@ over and the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread , and the chief pri@@ ests and the s@@ cri@@ bes sought how they might se@@ ize him by dec@@ eption , and kill him .
most certainly I tell you , wher@@ ever this Go@@ od News may be pre@@ ached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
for the Son of Man goes , even as it is written about him , but wo@@ e to that man by whom the Son of Man is bet@@ ray@@ ed ! it would be better for that man if he had not been born . "
as they were e@@ ating , J@@ es@@ us took bread , and when he had b@@ les@@ sed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " T@@ ake , eat . this is my body . "
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the v@@ ine , until that day when I drink it an@@ ew in the Kingdom of God . "
but a certain one of those who stood by drew his s@@ word , and struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his e@@ ar .
a certain young man followed him , having a lin@@ en clo@@ th thrown around himself , over his nak@@ ed body . the young men gra@@ bbed him ,
Peter had followed him from a distance , until he came into the court of the high pri@@ est . he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light of the fire .
some began to sp@@ it on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with f@@ ists , and to tell him , " Pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y ! " the officers struck him with the pal@@ ms of their hands .
they comp@@ elled one passing by , coming from the country , Simon of Cy@@ ren@@ e , the father of Alexander and Ru@@ f@@ us , to go with them , that he might bear his cross .
they brought him to the place called gol@@ go@@ th@@ a , which is , being interpreted , " The place of a s@@ kul@@ l . "
the super@@ s@@ cri@@ ption of his accus@@ ation was written over him , " the King of the Jews . "
one ran , and filling a spon@@ ge full of vin@@ eg@@ ar , put it on a Re@@ ed , and gave it to him to drink , saying , " Let him be . let 's see whether Eli@@ j@@ ah comes to take him down . "
when the centur@@ ion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cri@@ ed out like this and bre@@ ath@@ ed his last , he said , " T@@ rul@@ y this man was the Son of God ! "
entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , d@@ ressed in a white ro@@ be , and they were amaz@@ ed .
now when he had risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene , from whom he had cast out seven dem@@ ons .
after@@ ward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table , and he re@@ bu@@ ked them for their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe those who had seen him after he had risen .
so then the Lord , after he had spoken to them , was received up into heav@@ en , and sat down at the right hand of God .
according to the cust@@ om of the pri@@ est 's office , his lot was to enter into the temp@@ le of the Lord and bur@@ n incen@@ se .
but the an@@ gel said to him , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid , Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
be@@ hold , you will be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things will happen , because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their proper time . "
when he came out , he could not speak to them , and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temp@@ le . he continued making signs to them , and remained m@@ ute .
but when she saw him , she was greatly troubled at the saying , and considered what kind of sal@@ ut@@ ation this might be .
be@@ hold , you will conce@@ ive in your w@@ om@@ b , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' J@@ es@@ us . '
for be@@ hold , when the voice of your gre@@ et@@ ing came into my e@@ ars , the baby le@@ ap@@ ed in my w@@ om@@ b for joy !
b@@ les@@ sed is she who believed , for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord ! "
it happened on the eighth day , that they came to circum@@ c@@ ise the child ; and they would have called him Z@@ ac@@ har@@ ias , after the name of the father .
they came with has@@ te , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the baby was lying in the fe@@ eding t@@ roug@@ h .
when the days of their pur@@ ification according to the law of Mos@@ es were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jer@@ usalem , to present him to the Lord
be@@ hold , there was a man in Jer@@ usalem whose name was Simeon . this man was righ@@ te@@ ous and dev@@ out , looking for the con@@ so@@ lation of Israel , and the Holy Spiri@@ t was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spiri@@ t that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for my eyes have seen your sal@@ vation ,
the child was growing , and was becoming strong in spirit , being filled with wis@@ dom , and the grace of God was upon him .
it happened after three days they found him in the temp@@ le , sitting in the mid@@ st of the teachers , both list@@ ening to them , and asking them questions .
as it is written in the book of the words of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , " The voice of one cr@@ ying in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , ' Mak@@ e ready the way of the Lord . make his p@@ aths stra@@ ight .
bring forth therefore fru@@ its wor@@ thy of rep@@ ent@@ ance , and don '@@ t begin to say among yo@@ ur@@ selves , ' We have Ab@@ ra@@ ham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Ab@@ ra@@ ham from these stones !
even now the ax@@ e also lies at the root of the trees . every tree therefore that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and thrown into the fire . "
whose fan is in his hand , and he will thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly cleans@@ e his th@@ res@@ hing floor , and will gather the wheat into his bar@@ n ; but he will bur@@ n up the c@@ haf@@ f with un@@ qu@@ en@@ cha@@ ble fire . "
J@@ es@@ us himself , when he began to te@@ ach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of H@@ eli ,
J@@ es@@ us answ@@ ered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the dev@@ il , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world in a moment of time .
he led him to Jer@@ usalem , and set him on the pin@@ n@@ acle of the temp@@ le , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yo@@ ur@@ self down from here ,
he closed the book , gave it back to the atten@@ d@@ ant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the syn@@ ago@@ gue were fas@@ tened on him .
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the bro@@ w of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the c@@ lif@@ f .
he rose up from the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law was aff@@ lic@@ ted with a great f@@ ever , and they beg@@ ged him for her .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any si@@ ck with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .
when it was day , he depar@@ ted and went into an un@@ inhabited place , and the multi@@ tu@@ des looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t go away from them .
now it happened , while the multi@@ tude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gen@@ nes@@ aret .
for he was amaz@@ ed , and all who were with him , at the catch of fish which they had caught ;
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multi@@ tude , they went up to the hous@@ et@@ op , and let him down through the ti@@ les with his co@@ t into the mid@@ st before J@@ es@@ us .
but some of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees said to them , " Wh@@ y do you do that which is not law@@ ful to do on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day ? "
J@@ es@@ us , answ@@ ering them , said , " ha@@ ven '@@ t you read what David did when he was hun@@ gry , he , and those who were with him ;
b@@ les@@ sed are you when men shall h@@ ate you , and when they shall exclu@@ de and mo@@ ck you , and throw out your name as ev@@ il , for the Son of Man 's sake .
to him who strikes you on the che@@ ek , offer also the other ; and from him who takes away your clo@@ ak , don '@@ t with@@ hold your co@@ at also .
why do you see the spec@@ k of c@@ haf@@ f that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the be@@ am that is in your own eye ?
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don '@@ t gather fig@@ s from thor@@ ns , nor do they gather grap@@ es from a br@@ am@@ ble b@@ ush .
those who were sent , returning to the house , found that the ser@@ vant who had been si@@ ck was well .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , be@@ hold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a wi@@ dow . many people of the city were with her .
this is he of whom it is written , ' be@@ hold , I send my mes@@ sen@@ ger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
" for I tell you , among those who are born of women there is not a greater pro@@ phe@@ t than John the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ zer , yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he . "
they are like children who sit in the market@@ place , and call one to another , saying , ' We pip@@ ed to you , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t dance . we mour@@ ned , and you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t we@@ ep . '
it happened soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , pre@@ aching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God . with him were the twelve ,
other se@@ ed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it with@@ ered away , because it had no mo@@ ist@@ ure .
those along the road are those who hear , then the dev@@ il comes , and takes away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be sav@@ ed .
when J@@ es@@ us stepped ash@@ ore , a certain man out of the city who had dem@@ ons for a long time met him . he wor@@ e no clo@@ th@@ es , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t live in a house , but in the tom@@ bs .
the dem@@ ons came out from the man , and entered into the p@@ ig@@ s , and the her@@ d rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were dro@@ w@@ ned .
be@@ hold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue . he fell down at J@@ es@@ us ' feet , and beg@@ ged him to come into his house ,
as many as don '@@ t receive you , when you de@@ part from that city , shake off even the d@@ ust from your feet for a testimony against them . "
he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he b@@ les@@ sed them , and broke them , and gave them to the dis@@ cip@@ les to set before the multi@@ tude .
for who@@ ever desi@@ res to save his life will lose it , but who@@ ever will lose his life for my sake , the same will save it .
for who@@ ever will be as@@ ha@@ med of me and of my words , of him will the Son of Man be as@@ ha@@ med , when he comes in his gl@@ ory , and the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , and of the hol@@ y an@@ gel@@ s .
but I tell you the truth : there are some of those who stand here , who will in no way tas@@ te of death , until they see the Kingdom of God . "
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sle@@ ep , but when they were fully aw@@ ake , they saw his gl@@ ory , and the two men who stood with him .
while he was still coming , the dem@@ on threw him down and conv@@ ul@@ sed him viol@@ ently . but J@@ es@@ us re@@ bu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , and he@@ aled the boy , and gave him back to his father .
but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand this saying . it was conce@@ aled from them , that they should not perce@@ ive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying .
it came to pass , when the days were near that he should be taken up , he in@@ t@@ ently set his face to go to Jer@@ usalem ,
when his dis@@ cip@@ les , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Eli@@ j@@ ah did ? "
but he turned and re@@ bu@@ ked them , " You don '@@ t know of what kind of spirit you are .
for the Son of Man di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
J@@ es@@ us said to him , " The fo@@ x@@ es have ho@@ les , and the birds of the sky have nes@@ ts , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
" Wo@@ e to you , Ch@@ or@@ az@@ in ! Wo@@ e to you , B@@ eth@@ sa@@ ida ! for if the m@@ igh@@ ty works had been done in T@@ y@@ re and S@@ id@@ on which were done in you , they would have re@@ pen@@ ted long ago , sitting in s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th and ashes .
for I tell you that many pro@@ ph@@ ets and kings desi@@ red to see the things which you see , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear them . "
in the same way a Lev@@ ite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
for@@ give us our sin@@ s , for we ourselves also for@@ give everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temp@@ tation , but deliver us from the ev@@ il one . ' "
" I tell you , keep asking , and it will be given you . keep seeking , and you will find . keep kno@@ cking , and it will be opened to you .
or if he asks for an eg@@ g , he won '@@ t give him a scor@@ p@@ ion , will he ?
he was casting out a dem@@ on , and it was m@@ ute . it happened , when the dem@@ on had gone out , the m@@ ute man spoke ; and the multi@@ tu@@ des mar@@ v@@ eled .
the un@@ clean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through d@@ ry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
the lam@@ p of the body is the eye . therefore when your eye is good , your whole body is also full of light ; but when it is ev@@ il , your body also is full of d@@ ark@@ ness .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wh@@ ol@@ ly full of light , as when the lam@@ p with its bright sh@@ ining gives you light . "
Wo@@ e to you , s@@ cri@@ bes and P@@ har@@ is@@ ees , hy@@ po@@ cri@@ tes ! for you are like hidden graves , and the men who walk over them don '@@ t know it . "
as he said these things to them , the s@@ cri@@ bes and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees began to be ter@@ ri@@ bly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
therefore whatever you have said in the d@@ ark@@ ness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the e@@ ar in the in@@ ner rooms will be proclaimed on the hous@@ et@@ ops .
" I tell you , my friends , don '@@ t be afraid of those who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but the very ha@@ ir@@ s of your head are all num@@ ber@@ ed . therefore don '@@ t be afraid . you are of more value than many spar@@ ro@@ ws .
everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be for@@ given , but those who b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme against the Holy Spiri@@ t will not be for@@ given .
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my bar@@ ns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my gra@@ in and my goods .
but if this is how God clo@@ th@@ es the gr@@ ass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the ov@@ en , how much more will he clo@@ the you , O you of little faith ?
be like men watching for their lor@@ d , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and kno@@ cks , they may immediately open to him .
b@@ les@@ sed are those servants , whom the lor@@ d will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will d@@ ress himself , and make them rec@@ line , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the th@@ i@@ ef was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
it happened , when he went into the house of one of the rul@@ ers of the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees on a Sab@@ b@@ ath to eat bread , that they were watching him .
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , " b@@ les@@ sed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God ! "
who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bear his own cross , and come after me , can '@@ t be my dis@@ cip@@ le .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sends an envoy , and asks for conditions of peace .
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the man@@ ure p@@ ile . it is thrown out . he who has e@@ ars to hear , let him hear . "
when he has found it , he carries it on his sho@@ ul@@ ders , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors , saying , ' re@@ jo@@ ice with me , for I have found the d@@ rac@@ h@@ ma which I had lost . '
I will get up and go to my father , and will tell him , " F@@ ather , I have sin@@ ned against heav@@ en , and in your sight .
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad , for this , your brother , was dead , and is alive again . he was lost , and is found . ' "
I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
it would be better for him if a mil@@ l@@ stone were hun@@ g around his nec@@ k , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to st@@ um@@ ble .
but who is there among you , having a ser@@ vant p@@ low@@ ing or keeping she@@ ep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' C@@ ome immediately and sit down at the table , '
he said to the dis@@ cip@@ les , " The days will come , when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
for as the ligh@@ t@@ ning , when it fl@@ ashes out of the one part under the sky , sh@@ ines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
as it happened in the days of No@@ ah , even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man .
they ate , they d@@ rank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ ah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise , even as it happened in the days of lot : they ate , they d@@ rank , they bought , they sold , they plan@@ ted , they built ;
but in the day that lot went out from So@@ dom , it ra@@ ined fire and sul@@ f@@ ur from the sky , and destroyed them all .
I tell you , in that night there will be two people in one bed . the one will be taken , and the other will be left .
you know the comman@@ d@@ ments : ' D@@ on '@@ t commit ad@@ ul@@ tery , ' ' D@@ on '@@ t murder , ' ' D@@ on '@@ t ste@@ al , ' ' D@@ on '@@ t give false testimony , ' ' hon@@ or your father and your mother . ' "
for it is easier for a C@@ ame@@ l to enter in through a ne@@ ed@@ le 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God . "
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " be@@ hold , we are going up to Jer@@ usalem , and all the things that are written through the pro@@ ph@@ ets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
for I fear@@ ed you , because you are an ex@@ acting man . you take up that which you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t lay down , and re@@ ap that which you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t so@@ w . '
then why di@@ d@@ n '@@ t you deposit my money in the bank , and at my coming , I might have earned interest on it ? '
for the days will come on you , when your enem@@ ies will throw up a barri@@ c@@ ade against you , sur@@ round you , hem you in on every side ,
and will d@@ ash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know the time of your vis@@ itation . "
he answ@@ ered them , " I also will ask you one question . tell me :
at the proper season , he sent a ser@@ vant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the v@@ ine@@ yard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reas@@ oned among themselves , saying , ' This is the he@@ ir . come , let 's kill him , that the inher@@ it@@ ance may be ours . '
but he perceived their craf@@ tin@@ ess , and said to them , " Wh@@ y do you test me ?
but those who are considered wor@@ thy to at@@ tain to that age and the resur@@ rec@@ tion from the dead , neither mar@@ ry , nor are given in marriage .
but that the dead are raised , even Mos@@ es showed at the b@@ ush , when he called the Lord ' The God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . '
then let those who are in Ju@@ de@@ a flee to the mountains . let those who are in the mid@@ st of her de@@ part . let those who are in the country not enter there@@ in .
men fa@@ in@@ ting for fear , and for expec@@ tation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heav@@ ens will be shaken .
every day J@@ es@@ us was teaching in the temp@@ le , and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Oli@@ vet .
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
for who is greater , one who s@@ its at the table , or one who serves ? Is@@ n '@@ t it he who s@@ its at the table ? but I am in the mid@@ st of you as one who serves .
when he rose up from his pray@@ er , he came to the dis@@ cip@@ les , and found them sle@@ eping because of gri@@ ef ,
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the s@@ word ? "
a certain one of them struck the ser@@ vant of the high pri@@ est , and cut off his right e@@ ar .
when I was with you in the temp@@ le daily , you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of d@@ ark@@ ness . "
they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high pri@@ est 's house . but Peter followed from a distance .
as soon as it was day , the assembly of the el@@ ders of the people was gathered together , both chief pri@@ ests and s@@ cri@@ bes , and they led him away into their council , saying ,
when he found out that he was in Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who was also in Jer@@ usalem during those days .
when they came to the place that is called The s@@ kul@@ l , they cru@@ ci@@ fied him there with the criminals , one on the right and the other on the left .
an ins@@ cri@@ ption was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and H@@ eb@@ re@@ w : " this IS the King of the Jews . "
( he had not consen@@ ted to their coun@@ sel and de@@ ed ) , from Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a city of the Jews , who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God :
he took it down , and wrapped it in a lin@@ en clo@@ th , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
but on the first day of the week , at early da@@ wn , they and some others came to the tomb , bringing the sp@@ ices which they had prepared .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of s@@ inf@@ ul men , and be cru@@ ci@@ fied , and the third day rise again ? "
it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
they rose up that very hour , returned to Jer@@ usalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and those who were with them ,
it happened , while he b@@ les@@ sed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heav@@ en .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
the Wor@@ d became f@@ les@@ h , and lived among us . we saw his gl@@ ory , such gl@@ ory as of the one and only Son of the F@@ ather , full of grace and truth .
no one has seen God at any time . the one and only Son , who is in the bos@@ om of the F@@ ather , he has declared him .
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , her@@ e@@ after you will see heav@@ en opened , and the an@@ gel@@ s of God as@@ cen@@ ding and des@@ cen@@ ding on the Son of Man . "
after this , he went down to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , he , and his mother , his brothers , and his dis@@ cip@@ les ; and they stayed there a few days .
he made a w@@ hip of cor@@ ds , and threw all out of the temp@@ le , both the she@@ ep and the ox@@ en ; and he p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw their tables .
when therefore he was raised from the dead , his dis@@ cip@@ les remember@@ ed that he said this , and they believed the S@@ crip@@ ture , and the word which J@@ es@@ us had said .
now when he was in Jer@@ usalem at the P@@ ass@@ over , during the feast , many believed in his name , obser@@ ving his signs which he did .
Nic@@ o@@ de@@ mu@@ s said to him , " Ho@@ w can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , and be born ? "
that which is born of the f@@ les@@ h is f@@ les@@ h . that which is born of the Spiri@@ t is spirit .
most certainly I tell you , we speak that which we know , and testify of that which we have seen , and you don '@@ t receive our witness .
no one has as@@ cen@@ ded into heav@@ en , but he who des@@ cen@@ ded out of heav@@ en , the Son of Man , who is in heav@@ en .
he who believes in him is not jud@@ ged . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe has been jud@@ ged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the ear@@ th belongs to the ear@@ th , and speaks of the ear@@ th . he who comes from heav@@ en is above all .
the woman said to him , " I know that Mes@@ si@@ ah comes , " ( he who is called Ch@@ r@@ ist ) . " when he has come , he will declare to us all things . "
so when he came into Gal@@ il@@ ee , the Gal@@ il@@ e@@ ans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jer@@ usalem at the feast , for they also went to the feast .
when he heard that J@@ es@@ us had come out of Ju@@ de@@ a into Gal@@ il@@ ee , he went to him , and beg@@ ged him that he would come down and he@@ al his son , for he was at the point of death .
J@@ es@@ us said to him , " G@@ o your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that J@@ es@@ us spoke to him , and he went his way .
as he was now going down , his servants met him and reported , saying " Y@@ our child lives ! "
so he inqu@@ ired of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Y@@ es@@ ter@@ day at the seventh hour , the f@@ ever left him . "
now in Jer@@ usalem by the she@@ ep gate , there is a pool , which is called in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " B@@ eth@@ es@@ da , " having five por@@ ches .
in these lay a great multi@@ tude of those who were si@@ ck , b@@ lin@@ d , la@@ me , or paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed , waiting for the moving of the water ;
for this cause the Jews persec@@ uted J@@ es@@ us , and sought to kill him , because he did these things on the Sab@@ b@@ ath .
for the F@@ ather has aff@@ ection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may mar@@ v@@ el .
that all may hon@@ or the Son , even as they hon@@ or the F@@ ather . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t hon@@ or the Son do@@ es@@ n '@@ t hon@@ or the F@@ ather who sent him .
" most certainly I tell you , he who he@@ ars my word , and believes him who sent me , has eter@@ nal life , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be sav@@ ed .
" D@@ on '@@ t think that I will accuse you to the F@@ ather . there is one who acc@@ uses you , even Mos@@ es , on whom you have set your hope .
after these things , J@@ es@@ us went away to the other side of the sea of Gal@@ il@@ ee , which is also called the Sea of Ti@@ ber@@ ias .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve bas@@ kets with broken pieces from the five bar@@ ley lo@@ aves , which were left over by those who had e@@ aten .
J@@ es@@ us therefore , perce@@ i@@ ving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had ro@@ wed about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five or thirty stadi@@ a , they saw J@@ es@@ us walk@@ ing on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
when the multi@@ tude therefore saw that J@@ es@@ us was@@ n '@@ t there , nor his dis@@ cip@@ les , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Cap@@ er@@ na@@ um , seeking J@@ es@@ us .
J@@ es@@ us said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hun@@ gry , and he who believes in me will never be thir@@ st@@ y .
all those whom the F@@ ather gives me will come to me . he who comes to me I will in no way throw out .
this is the will of my F@@ ather who sent me , that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing , but should raise him up at the last day .
I am the living bread which came down out of heav@@ en . if anyone e@@ ats of this bread , he will live fore@@ ver . yes , the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my f@@ les@@ h . "
J@@ es@@ us therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the f@@ les@@ h of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don '@@ t have life in yo@@ ur@@ selves .
as the living F@@ ather sent me , and I live because of the F@@ ather ; so he who fe@@ eds on me , he will also live because of me .
but there are some of you who don '@@ t believe . " for J@@ es@@ us knew from the beginning who they were who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe , and who it was who would bet@@ ray him .
he said , " For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me , unless it is given to him by my F@@ ather . "
now the feast of the Jews , the Fe@@ ast of bo@@ o@@ ths , was at hand .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own gl@@ ory , but he who seeks the gl@@ ory of him who sent him is true , and no un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is in him .
if a boy receives circum@@ c@@ ision on the Sab@@ b@@ ath , that the law of Mos@@ es may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sab@@ b@@ ath ?
but of the multi@@ tude , many believed in him . they said , " When the Ch@@ r@@ ist comes , he won '@@ t do more signs than those which this man has done , will he ? "
but he said this about the Spiri@@ t , which those believ@@ ing in him were to receive . for the Holy Spiri@@ t was not yet given , because J@@ es@@ us was@@ n '@@ t yet gl@@ ori@@ fied .
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
I say the things which I have seen with my F@@ ather ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Ab@@ ra@@ ham di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do this .
therefore J@@ es@@ us said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I ha@@ ven '@@ t come of myself , but he sent me .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but J@@ es@@ us was hidden , and went out of the temp@@ le , having gone through their mid@@ st , and so passed by .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
when he had said this , he sp@@ at on the ground , made mu@@ d with the sal@@ i@@ va , ano@@ in@@ ted the b@@ lin@@ d man 's eyes with the mu@@ d ,
the Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been b@@ lin@@ d , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him who had received his sight ,
but how he now sees , we don '@@ t know ; or who opened his eyes , we don '@@ t know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
his parents said these things because they fear@@ ed the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would conf@@ ess him as Ch@@ r@@ ist , he would be put out of the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
we know that God has spoken to Mos@@ es . but as for this man , we don '@@ t know where he comes from . "
we know that God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to sin@@ ners , but if anyone is a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and does his will , he list@@ ens to him .
" most certainly , I tell you , one who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t enter by the door into the she@@ ep fold , but clim@@ bs up some other way , the same is a th@@ i@@ ef and a rob@@ ber .
they will by no means follow a st@@ ran@@ ger , but will flee from him ; for they don '@@ t know the voice of st@@ ran@@ gers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be sav@@ ed , and will go in and go out , and will find pas@@ ture .
I have other she@@ ep , which are not of this fold . I must bring them also , and they will hear my voice . they will become one flock with one she@@ ph@@ er@@ d .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this comman@@ d@@ ment from my F@@ ather . "
my F@@ ather , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to sn@@ at@@ ch them out of my F@@ ather 's hand .
do you say of him whom the F@@ ather sanc@@ ti@@ fied and sent into the world , ' You b@@ las@@ ph@@ eme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary , her sister , secre@@ tly , saying , " The Te@@ acher is here , and is calling you . "
therefore when Mary came to where J@@ es@@ us was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have died . "
when J@@ es@@ us therefore saw her we@@ eping , and the Jews we@@ eping who came with her , he gro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit , and was troubled ,
J@@ es@@ us said , " T@@ ake away the stone . " Mar@@ th@@ a , the sister of him who was dead , said to him , " Lord , by this time there is a st@@ en@@ ch , for he has been dead four days . "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . J@@ es@@ us lifted up his eyes , and said , " F@@ ather , I than@@ k you that you list@@ ened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and fo@@ ot with wrap@@ p@@ ings , and his face was wrapped around with a clo@@ th . J@@ es@@ us said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
now the P@@ ass@@ over of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jer@@ usalem before the P@@ ass@@ over , to pur@@ ify themselves .
then they sought for J@@ es@@ us and spoke one with another , as they stood in the temp@@ le , " What do you thin@@ k@@ -@@ -@@ that he is@@ n '@@ t coming to the feast at all ? "
now the chief pri@@ ests and the P@@ har@@ is@@ ees had comman@@ ded that if anyone knew where he was , he should report it , that they might se@@ ize him .
then six days before the P@@ ass@@ over , J@@ es@@ us came to B@@ eth@@ any , where Lazar@@ us was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
Mary , therefore , took a po@@ und of o@@ in@@ tment of p@@ ure N@@ ard , very pre@@ ci@@ ous , and ano@@ in@@ ted the feet of J@@ es@@ us , and wi@@ ped his feet with her ha@@ ir . the house was filled with the fra@@ gr@@ ance of the o@@ in@@ tment .
now he said this , not because he car@@ ed for the poor , but because he was a th@@ i@@ ef , and having the money box , used to ste@@ al what was put into it .
his dis@@ cip@@ les di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand these things at first , but when J@@ es@@ us was gl@@ ori@@ fied , then they remember@@ ed that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multi@@ tude therefore that was with him when he called Lazar@@ us out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testi@@ fying about it .
most certainly I tell you , unless a gra@@ in of wheat falls into the ear@@ th and dies , it remains by itself alone . but if it dies , it be@@ ars much fruit .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " J@@ es@@ us said these things , and he depar@@ ted and hi@@ d himself from them .
if anyone list@@ ens to my say@@ ings , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe , I don '@@ t judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive my say@@ ings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the F@@ ather who sent me , he gave me a comman@@ d@@ ment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
then he p@@ oured water into the bas@@ in , and began to was@@ h the dis@@ cip@@ les ' feet , and to wi@@ pe them with the tow@@ el that was wrapped around him .
so when he had was@@ hed their feet , put his ou@@ ter gar@@ ment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " D@@ o you know what I have done to you ?
for I have given you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you .
most certainly I tell you , a ser@@ vant is not greater than his lor@@ d , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
I don '@@ t speak concerning all of you . I know whom I have chosen . but that the S@@ crip@@ ture may be fulfilled , ' He who e@@ ats bread with me has lifted up his he@@ el against me . '
little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' W@@ here I am going , you can '@@ t come , ' so now I tell you .
in my F@@ ather 's house are many homes . if it w@@ eren '@@ t so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
if you had known me , you would have known my F@@ ather also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my F@@ ather .
whatever you will ask in my name , that will I do , that the F@@ ather may be gl@@ ori@@ fied in the Son .
one who has my comman@@ d@@ ments , and keeps them , that person is one who lov@@ es me . one who lov@@ es me will be lov@@ ed by my F@@ ather , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love me do@@ es@@ n '@@ t keep my words . the word which you hear is@@ n '@@ t mine , but the F@@ ather 's who sent me .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . D@@ on '@@ t let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fear@@ ful .
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can '@@ t bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the v@@ ine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
I am the v@@ ine . you are the branches . he who remains in me , and I in him , the same be@@ ars much fruit , for apart from me you can do nothing .
if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
if you remain in me , and my words remain in you , you will ask whatever you desire , and it will be done for you .
" in this is my F@@ ather gl@@ ori@@ fied , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my dis@@ cip@@ les .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
no longer do I call you servants , for the ser@@ vant do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what his lor@@ d does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my F@@ ather , I have made known to you .
but all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they don '@@ t know him who sent me .
if I h@@ ad@@ n '@@ t done among them the works which no one else did , they wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have had sin . but now have they seen and also ha@@ ted both me and my F@@ ather .
" when the coun@@ sel@@ or has come , whom I will send to you from the F@@ ather , the Spiri@@ t of truth , who proceeds from the F@@ ather , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
most certainly I tell you , that you will we@@ ep and la@@ ment , but the world will re@@ jo@@ ice . you will be sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , but your sor@@ row will be turned into joy .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the F@@ ather in my name , he will give it to you .
I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech . but the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech , but will tell you pla@@ in@@ ly about the F@@ ather .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don '@@ t say to you , that I will pra@@ y to the F@@ ather for you ,
I came out from the F@@ ather , and have come into the world . again , I leave the world , and go to the F@@ ather . "
for the words which you have given me I have given to them , and they received them , and knew for sure that I came forth from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
I pra@@ y not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the ev@@ il one .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my gl@@ ory , which you have given me , for you lov@@ ed me before the foundation of the world .
Simon Peter followed J@@ es@@ us , as did another dis@@ cip@@ le . now that dis@@ cip@@ le was known to the high pri@@ est , and entered in with J@@ es@@ us into the court of the high pri@@ est ;
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of co@@ als , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . be@@ hold , these know the things which I said . "
they led J@@ es@@ us therefore from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has into the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um . it was early , and they themselves di@@ d@@ n '@@ t enter into the Pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um , that they might not be def@@ iled , but might eat the P@@ ass@@ over .
then P@@ il@@ ate went out again , and said to them , " be@@ hold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard these words , he brought J@@ es@@ us out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pav@@ ement , " but in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a . "
he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called " The Pla@@ ce of a s@@ kul@@ l , " which is called in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " gol@@ go@@ th@@ a , "
P@@ il@@ ate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " J@@ es@@ us of NA@@ Z@@ AR@@ E@@ T@@ H , the King of the Jews . "
therefore many of the Jews read this title , for the place where J@@ es@@ us was cru@@ ci@@ fied was near the city ; and it was written in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , in Latin , and in Greek .
but there were standing by the cross of J@@ es@@ us his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of C@@ lop@@ as , and Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb we@@ eping . so , as she we@@ pt , she sto@@ op@@ ed and looked into the tomb ,
and she saw two an@@ gel@@ s in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of J@@ es@@ us had la@@ in .
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the dis@@ cip@@ les therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
but the other dis@@ cip@@ les came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts away ) , dra@@ gging the net full of fish .
so when they got out on the land , they saw a fire of co@@ als there , and fish laid on it , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fif@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ three ; and even though there were so many , the net was@@ n '@@ t torn .
there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , which if they would all be written , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have room for the books that would be written .
being assemb@@ led together with them , he comman@@ ded them , " D@@ on '@@ t de@@ part from Jer@@ usalem , but wait for the promise of the F@@ ather , which you heard from me .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spiri@@ t has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jer@@ usalem , in all Ju@@ de@@ a and Samar@@ ia , and to the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th . "
all these with one accord continued stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly in pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation , along with the women , and Mary the mother of J@@ es@@ us , and with his brothers .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jer@@ usalem that in their language that field was called ' Ak@@ el@@ d@@ ama , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
they were all filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spiri@@ t gave them the ability to speak .
yes , and on my servants and on my hand@@ ma@@ i@@ den@@ s in those days , I will p@@ our out my Spiri@@ t , and they will pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! J@@ es@@ us of N@@ azar@@ eth , a man approved by God to you by m@@ igh@@ ty works and won@@ ders and signs which God did by him in the mid@@ st of you , even as you yo@@ ur@@ selves know ,
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
you made known to me the ways of life . you will make me full of gla@@ d@@ ness with your presence . '
being therefore ex@@ al@@ ted by the right hand of God , and having received from the F@@ ather the promise of the Holy Spiri@@ t , he has p@@ oured out this , which you now see and hear .
for the promise is to you , and to your children , and to all who are far off , even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself . "
they recogn@@ ized him , that it was he who used to sit beg@@ ging for gifts for the ne@@ edy at the Be@@ autiful G@@ ate of the temp@@ le . they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at what had happened to him .
as the la@@ me man who was he@@ aled held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the por@@ ch that is called Solomon 's , greatly won@@ dering .
it will be , that every sou@@ l that will not listen to that pro@@ phe@@ t will be ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the pro@@ ph@@ ets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
God , having raised up his ser@@ vant , J@@ es@@ us , sent him to you first , to b@@ less you , in turning away everyone of you from your w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess . "
the kings of the ear@@ th take a stand , and the rul@@ ers take council together , against the Lord , and against his Ch@@ r@@ ist . '
when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , and they spoke the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
but a certain man named An@@ an@@ ias , with Sap@@ ph@@ ira , his wife , sold a possession ,
by the hands of the A@@ post@@ les many signs and won@@ ders were done among the people . they were all with one accord in Solomon 's por@@ ch .
they agreed with him . summon@@ ing the A@@ post@@ les , they beat them and comman@@ ded them not to speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .
but some of those who were of the syn@@ ago@@ gue called " The Liber@@ tin@@ es , " and of the Cy@@ ren@@ ians , of the Alexand@@ ri@@ ans , and of those of Cil@@ ic@@ ia and Asia ar@@ ose , disp@@ ut@@ ing with Stephen .
then he came out of the land of the Chal@@ da@@ e@@ ans , and lived in Har@@ an . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
and they were brought back to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and laid in the tomb that Ab@@ ra@@ ham bought for a price in silver from the children of Ham@@ or of Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' Sir@@ s , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
I have su@@ rely seen the aff@@ li@@ ction of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their gro@@ an@@ ing . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
this is that Mos@@ es , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a pro@@ phe@@ t for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Mak@@ e us go@@ ds that will go before us , for as for this Mos@@ es , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
" our fa@@ thers had the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , even as he who spoke to Mos@@ es comman@@ ded him to make it according to the pat@@ tern that he had seen ;
but he , being full of the Holy Spiri@@ t , looked up stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly into heav@@ en , and saw the gl@@ ory of God , and J@@ es@@ us standing on the right hand of God ,
but they cri@@ ed out with a l@@ oud voice , and stopped their e@@ ars , and rushed at him with one accord .
Sa@@ ul was con@@ sent@@ ing to his death . a great persec@@ ution ar@@ ose against the assembly which was in Jer@@ usalem in that day . they were all sc@@ at@@ tered abroad throughout the regions of Ju@@ de@@ a and Samar@@ ia , except for the A@@ post@@ les .
the multi@@ tu@@ des list@@ ened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
for un@@ clean spir@@ its came out of many of those who had them . they came out , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice . many who had been paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed and la@@ me were he@@ aled .
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jer@@ usalem , and pre@@ ached the Go@@ od News to many villages of the Samar@@ it@@ ans .
now the passage of the S@@ crip@@ ture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a she@@ ep to the sla@@ ughter . as a lam@@ b before his s@@ hear@@ er is silent , so he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t open his m@@ outh .
he comman@@ ded the char@@ i@@ ot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch , and he b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed him .
when they came up out of the water , the Spiri@@ t of the Lord caught Philip away , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see him any more , for he went on his way re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
pre@@ aching bol@@ dly in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us . he spoke and disputed against the Hel@@ len@@ ists , but they were seeking to kill him .
so the assemb@@ lies throughout all Ju@@ de@@ a and Gal@@ il@@ ee and Samar@@ ia had peace , and were built up . they were multi@@ p@@ lied , walk@@ ing in the fear of the Lord and in the comfor@@ t of the Holy Spiri@@ t .
it happened in those days that she fell si@@ ck , and died . when they had was@@ hed her , they laid her in an up@@ per room .
when the an@@ gel who spoke to him had depar@@ ted , Cor@@ neli@@ us called two of his household servants and a dev@@ out soldier of those who w@@ aited on him continu@@ ally .
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the hous@@ et@@ op to pra@@ y at about noon .
now while Peter was very per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , be@@ hold , the men who were sent by Cor@@ neli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
when it happened that Peter entered , Cor@@ neli@@ us met him , fell down at his feet , and wor@@ shi@@ ped him .
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews , and in Jer@@ usalem ; whom they also killed , han@@ ging him on a tree .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and d@@ rank with him after he rose from the dead .
he comman@@ ded us to pre@@ ach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
they of the circum@@ c@@ ision who believed were amaz@@ ed , as many as came with Peter , because the gift of the Holy Spiri@@ t was also p@@ oured out on the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
when I had looked in@@ t@@ ently at it , I considered , and saw the four @@@ -@@ @ fo@@ oted animals of the ear@@ th , wild animals , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky .
they therefore who were sc@@ at@@ tered abroad by the op@@ pression that ar@@ ose about Stephen trav@@ eled as far as Pho@@ en@@ ic@@ ia , Cyprus , and Anti@@ o@@ ch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
the report concerning them came to the e@@ ars of the assembly which was in Jer@@ usalem . they sent out Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as to go as far as Anti@@ o@@ ch ,
and he went out and followed him . he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know that what was being done by the an@@ gel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
when Her@@ od had sought for him , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him , he examined the guards , and comman@@ ded that they should be put to death . he went down from Ju@@ de@@ a to Ca@@ es@@ area , and stayed there .
on an appointed day , Her@@ od d@@ ressed himself in royal clo@@ thing , sat on the th@@ r@@ one , and gave a speech to them .
now in the assembly that was at Anti@@ o@@ ch there were some pro@@ ph@@ ets and teachers : Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as , Simeon who was called N@@ ig@@ er , Lu@@ ci@@ us of Cy@@ ren@@ e , Man@@ a@@ en the foster brother of Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch , and Sa@@ ul .
when they had gone through the island to Pap@@ ho@@ s , they found a certain sor@@ cer@@ er , a false pro@@ phe@@ t , a J@@ ew , whose name was Bar J@@ es@@ us ,
but they , passing on from Per@@ ga , came to Anti@@ o@@ ch of P@@ is@@ idi@@ a . they went into the syn@@ ago@@ gue on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day , and sat down .
for those who d@@ well in Jer@@ usalem , and their rul@@ ers , because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know him , nor the voices of the pro@@ ph@@ ets which are read every Sab@@ b@@ ath , fulfilled them by condemning him .
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the hol@@ y and sure b@@ les@@ s@@ ings of David . '
but when the Jews saw the multi@@ tu@@ des , they were filled with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , and contra@@ dic@@ ted the things which were spoken by Paul , and b@@ las@@ phe@@ med .
for so has the Lord comman@@ ded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that you should bring sal@@ vation to the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th . ' "
at Ly@@ str@@ a a certain man sat , im@@ po@@ tent in his feet , a crip@@ ple from his mother 's w@@ om@@ b , who never had walked .
when the multi@@ tude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Ly@@ ca@@ on@@ ia , " The go@@ ds have come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men ! "
the pri@@ est of J@@ up@@ iter , whose temp@@ le was in front of their city , brought ox@@ en and gar@@ lands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multi@@ tu@@ des .
but when the A@@ post@@ les , Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as and Paul , heard of it , they t@@ ore their clo@@ th@@ es , and sp@@ ran@@ g into the multi@@ tude , cr@@ ying out ,
but as the dis@@ cip@@ les stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Bar@@ n@@ ab@@ as to Der@@ be .
when they had appointed el@@ ders for them in every assembly , and had pray@@ ed with fas@@ ting , they commen@@ ded them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
when they had arrived , and had gathered the assembly together , they reported all the things that God had done with them , and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations .
when they had come to Jer@@ usalem , they were received by the assembly and the A@@ post@@ les and the el@@ ders , and they reported all things that God had done with them .
now therefore why do you temp@@ t God , that you should put a yok@@ e on the nec@@ k of the dis@@ cip@@ les which neither our fa@@ thers nor we were able to bear ?
but Paul di@@ d@@ n '@@ t think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go with them to do the work .
Paul wanted to have him go out with him , and he took and circum@@ c@@ ised him because of the Jews who were in those parts ; for they all knew that his father was a Greek .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decre@@ es to them to keep which had been or@@ da@@ ined by the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders who were at Jer@@ usalem .
on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day we went forth outside of the city by a ri@@ versi@@ de , where we supposed there was a place of pray@@ er , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
but when her mas@@ ters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Sil@@ as , and dra@@ gged them into the market@@ place before the rul@@ ers .
now these were more no@@ ble than those in Thessalon@@ ica , in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind , exam@@ ining the S@@ crip@@ tures daily to see whether these things were so .
but when the Jews of Thessalon@@ ica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Ber@@ o@@ ea also , they came there likewise , ag@@ it@@ ating the multi@@ tu@@ des .
now all the Ath@@ en@@ ians and the st@@ ran@@ gers living there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignor@@ ance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to d@@ well on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , having determined appointed se@@ as@@ ons , and the boundaries of their d@@ wel@@ lings ,
that they should seek the Lord , if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us .
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by the man whom he has or@@ da@@ ined ; of which he has given assur@@ ance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
he depar@@ ted there , and went into the house of a certain man named J@@ ust@@ us , one who wor@@ shi@@ ped God , whose house was next door to the syn@@ ago@@ gue .
Cris@@ p@@ us , the ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Cor@@ in@@ th@@ ians , when they heard , believed and were b@@ ap@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
then all the Greeks laid hold on S@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , the ru@@ ler of the syn@@ ago@@ gue , and beat him before the judgment seat . Gal@@ li@@ o di@@ d@@ n '@@ t care about any of these things .
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jer@@ usalem , but I will return again to you if God Wil@@ ls , " he set sa@@ il from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
this man had been instruc@@ ted in the way of the Lord ; and being fer@@ v@@ ent in spirit , he spoke and ta@@ ught accur@@ ately the things concerning J@@ es@@ us , although he knew only the b@@ ap@@ tism of John .
he began to speak bol@@ dly in the syn@@ ago@@ gue . but when P@@ ris@@ cil@@ la and A@@ qu@@ ila heard him , they took him aside , and explained to him the way of God more accur@@ ately .
many of those who prac@@ ticed mag@@ ical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fif@@ ty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , to go to Jer@@ usalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
the whole city was filled with conf@@ usion , and they rushed with one accord into the the@@ ater , having seized G@@ ai@@ us and Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , men of Macedonia , Paul 's compan@@ ions in travel .
some therefore cri@@ ed one thing , and some another , for the assembly was in conf@@ usion . most of them di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know why they had come together .
if therefore Demetri@@ us and the craf@@ ts@@ men who are with him have a matter against anyone , the courts are open , and there are pro@@ consul@@ s . let them press charges against one another .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be able to give an account of this commo@@ tion . "
on the first day of the week , when the dis@@ cip@@ les were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , inten@@ ding to de@@ part on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us sat in the window , weighed down with deep sle@@ ep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sle@@ ep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
when he had gone up , and had broken bread , and e@@ aten , and had talked with them a long while , even until break of day , he depar@@ ted .
sa@@ iling from there , we came the following day opposite Chi@@ os . the next day we touched at Sam@@ os and stayed at Tro@@ gy@@ l@@ li@@ um , and the day after we came to Mil@@ et@@ us .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was has@@ tening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jer@@ usalem on the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
" now , be@@ hold , I know that you all , among whom I went about pre@@ aching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
when it happened that we had par@@ ted from them and had set sa@@ il , we came with a stra@@ ight course to C@@ os , and the next day to R@@ ho@@ des , and from there to Pat@@ ara .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's compan@@ ions , depar@@ ted , and came to Ca@@ es@@ area . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temp@@ le , s@@ tir@@ red up all the multi@@ tude and laid hands on him ,
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the comman@@ ding officer of the reg@@ im@@ ent that all Jer@@ usalem was in an u@@ pro@@ ar .
it happened that , as I made my journey , and came close to Dam@@ as@@ cus , about noon , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly there sh@@ one from the sky a great light around me .
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see for the gl@@ ory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Dam@@ as@@ cus .
when the blood of Stephen , your witness , was shed , I also was standing by , and con@@ sent@@ ing to his death , and guar@@ ding the clo@@ aks of those who killed him . '
they list@@ ened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " R@@ id the ear@@ th of this fellow , for he is@@ n '@@ t fit to live ! "
immediately those who were about to examine him depar@@ ted from him , and the comman@@ ding officer also was afraid when he real@@ ized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
when a great argument ar@@ ose , the comman@@ ding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
so he took him , and brought him to the comman@@ ding officer , and said , " Paul , the prison@@ er , summon@@ ed me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
when I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man , I sent him to you immediately , charging his acc@@ users also to bring their accusations against him before you . farewell . "
he even tried to prof@@ ane the temp@@ le , and we arrested him .
he ordered the centur@@ ion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to for@@ bid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Ca@@ es@@ area , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and comman@@ ded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jer@@ usalem stood around him , bringing against him many and gri@@ ev@@ ous charges which they could not prove ,
but F@@ es@@ tus , desi@@ ring to gain fav@@ or with the Jews , answ@@ ered Paul and said , " Ar@@ e you willing to go up to Jer@@ usalem , and be jud@@ ged by me there concerning these things ? "
when therefore they had come together here , I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t delay , but on the next day sat on the judgment seat , and comman@@ ded the man to be brought .
this I also did in Jer@@ usalem . I both shut up many of the sa@@ ints in prisons , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
when we had all fallen to the ear@@ th , I heard a voice saying to me in the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w language , ' Sa@@ ul , Sa@@ ul , why are you persec@@ ut@@ ing me ? it is hard for you to kick against the go@@ ads . '
embar@@ king in a ship of Ad@@ ram@@ y@@ tti@@ um , which was about to sa@@ il to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thessalon@@ ica , being with us .
when we had sa@@ iled across the sea which is off Cil@@ ic@@ ia and P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , we came to My@@ ra , a city of Ly@@ cia .
when we had sa@@ iled slowly many days , and had come with difficulty opposite C@@ ni@@ du@@ s , the wind not allowing us further , we sa@@ iled under the Le@@ e of Cre@@ te , opposite Sal@@ m@@ one .
but the centur@@ ion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul .
when the ship was caught , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
after they had ho@@ isted it up , they used cab@@ les to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run ag@@ round on the Sy@@ r@@ tis s@@ and bars , they lowered the sea an@@ ch@@ or , and so were driven along .
when neither sun nor stars sh@@ one on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be sav@@ ed was now taken away .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sa@@ il@@ ors sur@@ mis@@ ed that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sa@@ il@@ ors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pre@@ ten@@ ding that they would lay out an@@ ch@@ ors from the bo@@ w ,
when it was day , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t recogn@@ ize the land , but they noticed a certain bay with a beach , and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it .
casting off the an@@ ch@@ ors , they left them in the sea , at the same time un@@ t@@ ying the ru@@ d@@ der ro@@ pes . Ho@@ isting up the fore@@ sa@@ il to the wind , they made for the beach .
the nati@@ ves showed us un@@ common kin@@ d@@ ness ; for they kin@@ d@@ led a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bun@@ dle of sti@@ cks and laid them on the fire , a vi@@ per came out because of the heat , and fas@@ tened on his hand .
then when this was done , the rest also who had diseases in the island came , and were cu@@ red .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Ap@@ pi@@ us and The Th@@ ree ta@@ ver@@ ns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guar@@ ded him .
when they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t agree among themselves , they depar@@ ted after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spiri@@ t spoke righ@@ tly through I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah , the pro@@ phe@@ t , to our fa@@ thers ,
for I long to see you , that I may im@@ part to you some spir@@ itual gift , to the end that you may be established ;
that is , that I with you may be encouraged in you , each of us by the other 's faith , both yo@@ urs and mine .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist , for it is the power of God for sal@@ vation for everyone who believes ; for the J@@ ew first , and also for the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his ever@@ lasting power and di@@ vin@@ ity ; that they may be without exc@@ use .
and tra@@ ded the gl@@ ory of the incor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble God for the lik@@ eness of an image of cor@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble man , and of birds , and four @@@ -@@ @ fo@@ oted animals , and cre@@ eping things .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not f@@ it@@ ting ;
back@@ bi@@ ters , ha@@ te@@ ful to God , in@@ sol@@ ent , ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , bo@@ ast@@ ful , invent@@ ors of ev@@ il things , dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent to parents ,
who , kno@@ wing the ordin@@ ance of God , that those who practice such things are wor@@ thy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
but according to your hard@@ ness and un@@ rep@@ ent@@ ant heart you are treas@@ uring up for yo@@ ur@@ self wr@@ ath in the day of wr@@ ath , reve@@ lation , and of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @@@ -@@ @ seeking , and don '@@ t obe@@ y the truth , but obe@@ y un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , will be wr@@ ath and in@@ dign@@ ation ,
for as many as have sin@@ ned without law will also per@@ ish without the law . as many as have sin@@ ned under the law will be jud@@ ged by the law .
for it is@@ n '@@ t the hear@@ ers of the law who are righ@@ te@@ ous before God , but the do@@ ers of the law will be justified
( for when Gen@@ ti@@ les who don '@@ t have the law do by nature the things of the law , these , not having the law , are a law to themselves ,
you therefore who te@@ ach another , don '@@ t you te@@ ach yo@@ ur@@ self ? you who pre@@ ach that a man sho@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t ste@@ al , do you ste@@ al ?
May it never be ! yes , let God be found true , but every man a li@@ ar . as it is written , " That you might be justified in your words , and might prev@@ ail when you come into judgment . "
why not ( as we are s@@ lan@@ der@@ ously reported , and as some af@@ firm that we say ) , " Let us do ev@@ il , that good may come ? " those who say so are j@@ ust@@ ly condemned .
they have all turned aside . they have together become un@@ profitable . there is no one who does good , no , not , so much as one . "
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every m@@ outh may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
he is the father of circum@@ c@@ ision to those who not only are of the circum@@ c@@ ision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Ab@@ ra@@ ham , which he had in un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision .
for if those who are of the law are he@@ ir@@ s , faith is made vo@@ id , and the promise is made of no effect .
without being weak@@ ened in faith , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ ah 's w@@ om@@ b .
yet , looking to the promise of God , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t w@@ av@@ er through un@@ belief , but grew strong through faith , giving gl@@ ory to God ,
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we re@@ jo@@ ice in hope of the gl@@ ory of God .
and hope do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dis@@ appoint us , because God 's love has been p@@ oured out into our hear@@ ts through the Holy Spiri@@ t who was given to us .
for if , while we were enem@@ ies , we were reconc@@ iled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconc@@ iled , we will be sav@@ ed by his life .
we were buried therefore with him through b@@ ap@@ tism to death , that just like Ch@@ r@@ ist was raised from the dead through the gl@@ ory of the F@@ ather , so we also might walk in new@@ ness of life .
kno@@ wing this , that our old man was cru@@ ci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bon@@ da@@ ge to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bon@@ d@@ servants of sin , you became obe@@ di@@ ent from the heart to that form of teaching where@@ un@@ to you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now as@@ ha@@ med ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanc@@ ti@@ fication , and the result of eter@@ nal life .
or don '@@ t you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has domin@@ ion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives , but if the husband dies , she is dis@@ charged from the law of the husband .
for I don '@@ t know what I am doing . for I don '@@ t practice what I desire to do ; but what I h@@ ate , that I do .
but if what I don '@@ t desire , that I do , I consent to the law that it is good .
for I know that in me , that is , in my f@@ les@@ h , d@@ wel@@ ls no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don '@@ t find it doing that which is good .
for the good which I desire , I don '@@ t do ; but the ev@@ il which I don '@@ t desire , that I practice .
but if what I don '@@ t desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which d@@ wel@@ ls in me .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to those who are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who don '@@ t walk according to the f@@ les@@ h , but according to the Spiri@@ t .
for those who live according to the f@@ les@@ h set their min@@ ds on the things of the f@@ les@@ h , but those who live according to the Spiri@@ t , the things of the Spiri@@ t .
because the mind of the f@@ les@@ h is hos@@ tile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the f@@ les@@ h but in the Spiri@@ t , if it is so that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ wel@@ ls in you . but if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is not his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him who raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ wel@@ ls in you , he who raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us from the dead will also give life to your mort@@ al bodies through his Spiri@@ t who d@@ wel@@ ls in you .
for if you live after the f@@ les@@ h , you must die ; but if by the Spiri@@ t you put to death the de@@ eds of the body , you will live .
for as many as are led by the Spiri@@ t of God , these are children of God .
whom he pre@@ dest@@ ined , those he also called . whom he called , those he also justified . whom he justified , those he also gl@@ ori@@ fied .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
for he said to Mos@@ es , " I will have mer@@ cy on whom I have mer@@ cy , and I will have comp@@ as@@ sion on whom I have comp@@ as@@ sion . "
as he says also in Hos@@ ea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' bel@@ ov@@ ed , ' who was not bel@@ ov@@ ed . "
for He will finish the work and cut it short in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , because the Lord will make a short work upon the ear@@ th . "
what shall we say then ? that the Gen@@ ti@@ les , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , at@@ tained to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , even the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness which is of faith ;
that if you will conf@@ ess with your m@@ outh that J@@ es@@ us is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be sav@@ ed .
for there is no distinc@@ tion between J@@ ew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a pre@@ acher ?
and how will they pre@@ ach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News of peace , who bring glad ti@@ dings of good things ! "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were har@@ dened .
if by any means I may prov@@ oke to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y those who are my f@@ les@@ h , and may save some of them .
and so all Israel will be sav@@ ed . even as it is written , " There will come out of Z@@ ion the D@@ eli@@ ver@@ er , and he will turn away un@@ go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess from Jac@@ o@@ b .
D@@ on '@@ t be con@@ formed to this world , but be transformed by the rene@@ wing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @@@ -@@ @ ple@@ asing , and perfect will of God .
be of the same mind one toward another . D@@ on '@@ t set your mind on high things , but associate with the hum@@ ble . D@@ on '@@ t be wise in your own conce@@ its .
if it is possible , as much as it is up to you , be at peace with all men .
therefore " If your enemy is hun@@ gry , fe@@ ed him . if he is thir@@ st@@ y , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will he@@ ap co@@ als of fire on his head . "
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Ch@@ r@@ ist died , rose , and lived again , that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you desp@@ ise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
so then , let us follow after things which make for peace , and things by which we may build one another up .
D@@ on '@@ t overthrow God 's work for food 's sake . all things indeed are clean , however it is ev@@ il for that man who creates a stumbling block by e@@ ating .
but I write the more bol@@ dly to you in part , as remin@@ ding you , because of the grace that was given to me by God ,
yes , making it my aim to pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , not where Ch@@ r@@ ist was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
yes , it has been their good pleas@@ ure , and they are their deb@@ tors . for if the Gen@@ ti@@ les have been made par@@ tak@@ ers of their spir@@ itual things , they o@@ we it to them also to serve them in fle@@ sh@@ ly things .
I know that , when I come to you , I will come in the ful@@ l@@ ness of the b@@ les@@ sing of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
now I be@@ g you , brothers , by our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and by the love of the Spiri@@ t , that you strive together with me in your pray@@ ers to God for me ,
that I may be delivered from those who are dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ent in Ju@@ de@@ a , and that my service which I have for Jer@@ usalem may be acceptable to the sa@@ ints ;
I commen@@ d to you Pho@@ ebe , our sister , who is a ser@@ vant of the assembly that is at Cen@@ ch@@ re@@ a@@ e ,
now I be@@ g you , brothers , look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling , contrary to the doc@@ tr@@ ine which you learned , and turn away from them .
for those who are such don '@@ t serve our Lord , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but their own bel@@ ly ; and by their smooth and f@@ lat@@ tering speech , they dec@@ e@@ ive the hear@@ ts of the innocent .
God is fa@@ ith@@ ful , through whom you were called into the fel@@ low@@ ship of his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , our Lord .
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Ch@@ lo@@ e 's household , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
for the word of the cross is fo@@ ol@@ ishness to those who are dying , but to us who are sav@@ ed it is the power of God .
for seeing that in the wis@@ dom of God , the world through its wis@@ dom di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know God , it was God 's good pleas@@ ure through the fo@@ ol@@ ishness of the pre@@ aching to save those who believe .
but God chose the fo@@ ol@@ ish things of the world that he might put to sh@@ ame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to sh@@ ame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the low@@ ly things of the world , and the things that are desp@@ ised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
we speak wis@@ dom , however , among those who are full grown ; yet a wis@@ dom not of this world , nor of the rul@@ ers of this world , who are coming to nothing .
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spiri@@ t .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spiri@@ t which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
now the natural man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive the things of God 's Spiri@@ t , for they are fo@@ ol@@ ishness to him , and he can '@@ t know them , because they are spir@@ itu@@ ally dis@@ cer@@ ned .
for you are still fle@@ sh@@ ly . for in@@ so@@ far as there is je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , stri@@ fe , and factions among you , ar@@ en '@@ t you fle@@ sh@@ ly , and don '@@ t you walk in the ways of men ?
now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own la@@ bor .
each man 's work will be revealed . for the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man 's work is .
whether Paul , or A@@ pol@@ los , or C@@ ep@@ has , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . all are yo@@ urs ,
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you bo@@ ast as if you had not received it ?
you are already filled . you have already become rich . you have come to reign without us . yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
it is actually reported that there is sexual im@@ mor@@ ality among you , and such sexual im@@ mor@@ ality as is not even named among the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that one has his father 's wife .
pur@@ ge out the old ye@@ ast , that you may be a new lum@@ p , even as you are un@@ le@@ av@@ ened . for indeed Ch@@ r@@ ist , our P@@ ass@@ over , has been sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old ye@@ ast , neither with the ye@@ ast of mal@@ ice and w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , but with the un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread of sinc@@ erity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sin@@ ners of this world , or with the c@@ ov@@ et@@ ous and ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ers , or with i@@ do@@ la@@ ters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
D@@ on '@@ t you know that the sa@@ ints will judge the world ? and if the world is jud@@ ged by you , are you un@@ wor@@ thy to judge the smal@@ lest matters ?
if then , you have to judge things per@@ taining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ?
such were some of you , but you were was@@ hed . but you were sanc@@ ti@@ fied . but you were justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and in the Spiri@@ t of our God .
D@@ on '@@ t you know that your bodies are members of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? shall I then take the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make them members of a pro@@ stitute ? May it never be !
or don '@@ t you know that he who is joined to a pro@@ stitute is one body ? for , " The two , " says he , " will become one f@@ les@@ h . "
or don '@@ t you know that your body is a temp@@ le of the Holy Spiri@@ t which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
let the husband ren@@ der to his wife the aff@@ ection owed her , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
the wife do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have authority over her own body , but the husband . likewise also the husband do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have authority over his own body , but the wife .
( but if she de@@ parts , let her remain un@@ married , or else be reconc@@ iled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
yet if the un@@ beli@@ ever de@@ parts , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bon@@ da@@ ge in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
for how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
were you called being a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant ? D@@ on '@@ t let that bo@@ ther you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the dist@@ ress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
are you bound to a wife ? D@@ on '@@ t seek to be fre@@ ed . are you free from a wife ? D@@ on '@@ t seek a wife .
but I desire to have you to be free from car@@ es . he who is un@@ married is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may ple@@ ase the Lord ;
so then both he who gives his own vir@@ gin in marriage does well , and he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t give her in marriage does better .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to who@@ mev@@ er she desi@@ res , only in the Lord .
but food will not commen@@ d us to God . for neither , if we don '@@ t eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
if to others I am not an A@@ pos@@ tle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the se@@ al of my ap@@ ost@@ le@@ ship in the Lord .
have we no right to take along a wife who is a beli@@ ever , even as the rest of the A@@ post@@ les , and the brothers of the Lord , and C@@ ep@@ has ?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a v@@ ine@@ yard , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat of its fruit ? or who fe@@ eds a flock , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t drink from the flock 's milk ?
D@@ on '@@ t you know that those who serve around sac@@ red things eat from the things of the temp@@ le , and those who wait on the alt@@ ar have their portion with the alt@@ ar ?
but I have used none of these things , and I don '@@ t write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my bo@@ asting vo@@ id .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship entr@@ usted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , I may present the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Go@@ od News .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
but I beat my body and bring it into sub@@ mission , lest by any means , after I have pre@@ ached to others , I myself should be rejected .
now I would not have you ignor@@ ant , brothers , that our fa@@ thers were all under the cl@@ oud , and all passed through the sea ;
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
but I say that the things which the Gen@@ ti@@ les sacrifice , they sacrifice to dem@@ ons , and not to God , and I don '@@ t desire that you would have fel@@ low@@ ship with dem@@ ons .
you can '@@ t both drink the c@@ up of the Lord and the c@@ up of dem@@ ons . you can '@@ t both par@@ take of the table of the Lord , and of the table of dem@@ ons .
even as I also ple@@ ase all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be sav@@ ed .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know that the head of every man is Ch@@ r@@ ist , and the head of the woman is the man , and the head of Ch@@ r@@ ist is God .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shor@@ n . but if it is sha@@ me@@ ful for a woman to be shor@@ n or sha@@ ved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and gl@@ ory of God , but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
but in giving you this command , I don '@@ t praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse .
for first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it .
when therefore you assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves together , it is not the Lord 's Sup@@ per that you eat .
in the same way he also took the c@@ up , after Sup@@ per , saying , " This c@@ up is the new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant in my blood . do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . "
for he who e@@ ats and drin@@ ks in an un@@ wor@@ thy way e@@ ats and drin@@ ks judgment to himself , if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dis@@ cer@@ n the Lord 's body .
but if anyone is hun@@ gry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order wh@@ en@@ ever I come .
if the fo@@ ot would say , " Bec@@ ause I 'm not the hand , I 'm not part of the body , " it is not therefore not part of the body .
if the e@@ ar would say , " Bec@@ ause I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
those parts of the body which we think to be less hon@@ or@@ able , on those we bes@@ to@@ w more ab@@ und@@ ant hon@@ or ; and our un@@ present@@ able parts have more ab@@ und@@ ant pro@@ pri@@ ety ;
if I have the gift of pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and know all my@@ ster@@ ies and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don '@@ t have love , I am nothing .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
so also you , unless you ut@@ tered by the ton@@ gue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
if then I don '@@ t know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreig@@ ner , and he who speaks would be a foreig@@ ner to me .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruc@@ t others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the un@@ believ@@ ing ; but pro@@ ph@@ es@@ ying is for a sign , not to the un@@ believ@@ ing , but to those who believe .
let your wi@@ ves keep silent in the assemb@@ lies , for it has not been per@@ mitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subj@@ ection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own hus@@ bands at home , for it is sha@@ me@@ ful for a woman to ch@@ at@@ ter in the assembly .
if any man thinks himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him recogn@@ ize the things which I write to you , that they are the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Go@@ od News which I pre@@ ached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
for I am the least of the A@@ post@@ les , who is not wor@@ thy to be called an A@@ pos@@ tle , because I persec@@ uted the assembly of God .
now if Ch@@ r@@ ist is pre@@ ached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resur@@ rec@@ tion of the dead ?
if Ch@@ r@@ ist has not been raised , then our pre@@ aching is in v@@ ain , and your faith also is in v@@ ain .
yes , we are found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist , whom he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised .
that which you so@@ w , you don '@@ t so@@ w the body that will be , but a b@@ are gra@@ in , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
but God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each se@@ ed a body of its own .
there is one gl@@ ory of the sun , another gl@@ ory of the moon , and another gl@@ ory of the stars ; for one star di@@ ffers from another star in gl@@ ory .
as is the one made of d@@ ust , such are those who are also made of d@@ ust ; and as is the heav@@ en@@ ly , such are they also that are heav@@ en@@ ly .
as we have bor@@ ne the image of those made of d@@ ust , let 's also bear the image of the heav@@ en@@ ly .
therefore let no one desp@@ ise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
I re@@ jo@@ ice at the coming of Stephan@@ as , Fort@@ un@@ at@@ us , and A@@ cha@@ ic@@ us ; for that which was lacking on your part , they supplied .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us through the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints who are in the whole of A@@ cha@@ ia :
who comfor@@ ts us in all our aff@@ li@@ ction , that we may be able to comfor@@ t those who are in any aff@@ li@@ ction , through the comfor@@ t with which we ourselves are comfor@@ ted by God .
for our bo@@ asting is this : the testimony of our con@@ science , that in hol@@ iness and sinc@@ erity of God , not in fle@@ sh@@ ly wis@@ dom but in the grace of God we beha@@ ved ourselves in the world , and more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly toward you .
but I call God for a witness to my sou@@ l , that I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come to Cor@@ inth to spar@@ e you .
so that on the contrary you should rather for@@ give him and comfor@@ t him , lest by any means such a one should be sw@@ allowed up with his excessive sor@@ row .
being revealed that you are a letter of Ch@@ r@@ ist , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tab@@ lets of stone , but in tab@@ lets that are hear@@ ts of f@@ les@@ h .
for most certainly that which has been made g@@ lor@@ ious has not been made g@@ lor@@ ious in this respect , by reason of the gl@@ ory that sur@@ passes .
and not as Mos@@ es , who put a ve@@ il on his face , that the children of Israel wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t look stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ly on the end of that which was passing away .
in whom the go@@ d of this world has b@@ lin@@ ded the min@@ ds of the un@@ believ@@ ing , that the light of the Go@@ od News of the gl@@ ory of Ch@@ r@@ ist , who is the image of God , should not da@@ wn on them .
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , that the life of J@@ es@@ us may also be revealed in our body .
while we don '@@ t look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al , but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for most certainly in this we gro@@ an , lon@@ ging to be clo@@ th@@ ed with our habi@@ tation which is from heav@@ en ;
for indeed we who are in this tent do gro@@ an , being burdened ; not that we desire to be un@@ clo@@ th@@ ed , but that we desire to be clo@@ th@@ ed , that what is mort@@ al may be sw@@ allowed up by life .
we are cour@@ age@@ ous , I say , and are willing rather to be ab@@ sent from the body , and to be at home with the Lord .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
therefore if anyone is in Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is a new creation . the old things have passed away . be@@ hold , all things have become new .
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Ch@@ r@@ ist , as though God were ent@@ re@@ ating by us : we be@@ g you on behalf of Ch@@ r@@ ist , be reconc@@ iled to God .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I list@@ ened to you , in a day of sal@@ vation I helped you . " be@@ hold , now is the acceptable time . be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation .
great is my bol@@ d@@ ness of speech toward you . great is my bo@@ asting on your behalf . I am filled with comfor@@ t . I over@@ flow with joy in all our aff@@ li@@ ction .
this was not as we had hoped , but first they gave their own selves to the Lord , and to us through the will of God .
for you know the grace of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , that , though he was rich , yet for your sak@@ es he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedi@@ ent for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
but now complete the doing also , that as there was the readiness to be willing , so there may be the completion also out of your ability .
but I have sent the brothers that our bo@@ asting on your behalf may not be in v@@ ain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
so that I won '@@ t by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you un@@ prepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident bo@@ asting .
now may he who supplies se@@ ed to the so@@ wer and bread for food , supply and multi@@ ply your se@@ ed for so@@ wing , and increase the fru@@ its of your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ;
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the sa@@ ints , but ab@@ oun@@ ds also through many gi@@ v@@ ings of thanks to God ;
while they themselves also , with supp@@ lic@@ ation on your behalf , ye@@ ar@@ n for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you .
for though I should bo@@ ast somewhat ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
let such a person consider this , that what we are in word by letters when we are ab@@ sent , such are we also in de@@ ed when we are present .
for we are not b@@ old to number or compar@@ e ourselves with some of those who commen@@ d themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and compar@@ ing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
for we don '@@ t stretch ourselves too much , as though we di@@ d@@ n '@@ t reach to you . for we came even as far as to you with the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist ,
not bo@@ asting beyond proper limits in other men 's la@@ b@@ ors , but having hope that as your faith gro@@ ws , we will be ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly en@@ lar@@ ged by you in our sp@@ here of influence ,
or did I commit a sin in hum@@ b@@ ling myself that you might be ex@@ al@@ ted , because I pre@@ ached to you God 's Go@@ od News free of charge ?
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they bo@@ ast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if he dev@@ ours you , if he takes you cap@@ tive , if he ex@@ al@@ ts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
for what is there in which you were made in@@ fer@@ ior to the rest of the assemb@@ lies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? for@@ give me this wrong .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don '@@ t you know as to your own selves , that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is in you ? -@@ -@@ unless indeed you are dis@@ qualified .
I mar@@ v@@ el that you are so quickly de@@ ser@@ ting him who called you in the grace of Ch@@ r@@ ist to a different " good news " ;
and there is@@ n '@@ t another " good news . " only there are some who trouble you , and want to per@@ ver@@ t the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but even though we , or an an@@ gel from heav@@ en , should pre@@ ach to you any " good news " other than that which we pre@@ ached to you , let him be Cur@@ sed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man pre@@ aches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be Cur@@ sed .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Go@@ od News which was pre@@ ached by me , that it is not according to man .
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persec@@ uted the assembly of God , and rav@@ aged it .
I advanced in the Jews ' religion beyond many of my own age among my country@@ men , being more exce@@ ed@@ ingly z@@ e@@ al@@ ous for the traditions of my fa@@ thers .
to whom we gave no place in the way of subj@@ ection , not for an hour , that the truth of the Go@@ od News might continue with you .
but to the contrary , when they saw that I had been entr@@ usted with the Go@@ od News for the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ision , even as Peter with the Go@@ od News for the circum@@ c@@ ision
but if , while we sought to be justified in Ch@@ r@@ ist , we ourselves also were found sin@@ ners , is Ch@@ r@@ ist a ser@@ vant of sin ? certainly not !
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @@@ -@@ @ bre@@ aker .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness would have been of the law .
so that the law has become our tut@@ or to bring us to Ch@@ r@@ ist , that we might be justified by faith .
but I say that so long as the he@@ ir is a child , he is no different from a bon@@ d@@ ser@@ vant , though he is lor@@ d of all ;
what was the b@@ les@@ sing you enjoyed ? for I testify to you that , if possible , you would have p@@ lu@@ cked out your eyes and given them to me .
but I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone , for I am per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed about you .
however , the son by the hand@@ ma@@ id was born according to the f@@ les@@ h , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troub@@ les you will bear his judgment , who@@ ever he is .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don '@@ t use your freedom for gain to the f@@ les@@ h , but through love be servants to one another .
for he who so@@ ws to his own f@@ les@@ h will from the f@@ les@@ h re@@ ap corruption . but he who so@@ ws to the Spiri@@ t will from the Spiri@@ t re@@ ap eter@@ nal life .
let us not be we@@ ary in doing good , for we will re@@ ap in due season , if we don '@@ t give up .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
as many as desire to look good in the f@@ les@@ h , they comp@@ el you to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; only that they may not be persec@@ uted for the cross of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for even they who receive circum@@ c@@ ision don '@@ t keep the law themselves , but they desire to have you circum@@ c@@ ised , that they may bo@@ ast in your f@@ les@@ h .
from now on , let no one cause me any trouble , for I bear the marks of the Lord J@@ es@@ us bran@@ ded on my body .
to an administration of the ful@@ l@@ ness of the times , to sum up all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the things in the heav@@ ens , and the things on the ear@@ th , in him ;
in whom also we were assigned an inher@@ it@@ ance , having been fore@@ or@@ da@@ ined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the coun@@ sel of his will ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Go@@ od News of your sal@@ v@@ ation@@ -@@ -@@ in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spiri@@ t of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Ch@@ r@@ ist , ali@@ en@@ ated from the com@@ mon@@ wealth of Israel , and st@@ ran@@ gers from the c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men , as it has now been revealed to his hol@@ y A@@ post@@ les and pro@@ ph@@ ets in the Spiri@@ t ;
of which I was made a ser@@ vant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
but to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gen@@ ti@@ les also walk , in the fu@@ tility of their mind ,
being dar@@ ken@@ ed in their understanding , ali@@ en@@ ated from the life of God , because of the ignor@@ ance that is in them , because of the har@@ den@@ ing of their hear@@ ts ;
let him who st@@ ole ste@@ al no more ; but rather let him la@@ bor , working with his hands the thing that is good , that he may have something to give to him who has need .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your m@@ outh , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
for the things which are done by them in secret , it is a sh@@ ame even to speak of .
but all things , when they are re@@ proved , are revealed by the light , for everything that reve@@ als is light .
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Ch@@ r@@ ist also is the head of the assembly , being himself the Sav@@ ior of the body .
" for this cause a man will leave his father and mother , and will be joined to his wife . the two will become one f@@ les@@ h . "
servants , be obe@@ di@@ ent to those who according to the f@@ les@@ h are your mas@@ ters , with fear and tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling , in sing@@ len@@ ess of your heart , as to Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
put on the whole arm@@ or of God , that you may be able to stand against the w@@ il@@ es of the dev@@ il .
above all , taking up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to qu@@ en@@ ch all the fi@@ ery dar@@ ts of the ev@@ il one .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , T@@ y@@ chic@@ us , the bel@@ ov@@ ed brother and fa@@ ith@@ ful ser@@ vant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
for God is my witness , how I long after all of you in the tender mer@@ cies of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us .
now I desire to have you know , brothers , that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Go@@ od News ;
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly b@@ old to speak the word of God without fear .
for I know that this will turn out to my sal@@ vation , through your supp@@ lic@@ ation and the supply of the Spiri@@ t of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist ,
but if I live on in the f@@ les@@ h , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don '@@ t know what I will choose .
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
each of you not just looking to his own things , but each of you also to the things of others .
but I hope in the Lord J@@ es@@ us to send Tim@@ o@@ thy to you soon , that I also may be che@@ ered up when I know how you are doing .
therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see how it will go with me .
for indeed he was si@@ ck , nearly to death , but God had mer@@ cy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sor@@ row on sor@@ row .
who will change the body of our hum@@ iliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his gl@@ ory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
in nothing be anx@@ ious , but in everything , by pray@@ er and petition with Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving , let your requests be made known to God .
but I re@@ jo@@ ice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revi@@ ved your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you la@@ cked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect to lack , for I have learned in whatever state I am , to be content in it .
you yo@@ ur@@ selves also know , you Philip@@ p@@ ians , that in the beginning of the Go@@ od News , when I depar@@ ted from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
who delivered us out of the power of d@@ ark@@ ness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ;
for by him all things were created , in the heav@@ ens and on the ear@@ th , things visible and things in@@ visible , whether th@@ ron@@ es or domin@@ ions or princip@@ alities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
and through him to reconc@@ ile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the ear@@ th , or things in the heav@@ ens , having made peace through the blood of his cross .
now I re@@ jo@@ ice in my suffer@@ ings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of Ch@@ r@@ ist in my f@@ les@@ h for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
for though I am ab@@ sent in the f@@ les@@ h , yet am I with you in the spirit , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing and seeing your order , and the stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ness of your faith in Ch@@ r@@ ist .
rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were ta@@ ught , ab@@ oun@@ ding in it in Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
in whom you were also circum@@ c@@ ised with a circum@@ c@@ ision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sin@@ s of the f@@ les@@ h , in the circum@@ c@@ ision of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
having been buried with him in b@@ ap@@ tism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
if then you were raised together with Ch@@ r@@ ist , seek the things that are above , where Ch@@ r@@ ist is , se@@ ated on the right hand of God .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the ear@@ th .
for I testify about him , that he has great z@@ e@@ al for you , and for those in La@@ odi@@ cea , and for those in H@@ i@@ er@@ ap@@ ol@@ is .
when this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the La@@ odi@@ ce@@ ans ; and that you also read the letter from La@@ odi@@ cea .
Paul , Sil@@ van@@ us , and Tim@@ o@@ thy , to the assembly of the Thessalon@@ ians in God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist : grace to you and peace from God our F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
for from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and A@@ cha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything .
but even as we have been approved by God to be entr@@ usted with the Go@@ od News , so we speak ; not as ple@@ asing men , but God , who tests our hear@@ ts .
nor seeking gl@@ ory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as A@@ post@@ les of Ch@@ r@@ ist .
even so , aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately lon@@ ging for you , we were well pleased to im@@ part to you , not the Go@@ od News of God only , but also our own so@@ ul@@ s , because you had become very de@@ ar to us .
for you remember , brothers , our la@@ bor and trav@@ ail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we pre@@ ached to you the Go@@ od News of God .
for most certainly , when we were with you , we told you be@@ fore@@ hand that we are to suffer aff@@ li@@ ction , even as it happened , and you know .
and the Lord make you to increase and ab@@ ound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
and that you make it your ambi@@ tion to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instruc@@ ted you ;
but we don '@@ t want you to be ignor@@ ant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen as@@ le@@ ep , so that you don '@@ t gri@@ eve like the rest , who have no hope .
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way prece@@ de those who have fallen as@@ le@@ ep .
for the Lord himself will des@@ cen@@ d from heav@@ en with a sh@@ out , with the voice of the Ar@@ chan@@ gel , and with God 's tr@@ ump@@ et . the dead in Ch@@ r@@ ist will rise first ,
but let us , since we belong to the day , be so@@ ber , putting on the bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te of faith and love , and , for a hel@@ met , the hope of sal@@ vation .
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith gro@@ ws exce@@ ed@@ ingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another ab@@ oun@@ ds ;
this is an obvious sign of the righ@@ te@@ ous judgment of God , to the end that you may be counted wor@@ thy of the Kingdom of God , for which you also suffer .
D@@ on '@@ t you remember that , when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you both do and will do the things we command .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in la@@ bor and trav@@ ail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be as@@ ha@@ med .
to which I was appointed a pre@@ acher and an A@@ pos@@ tle ( I am telling the truth in Ch@@ r@@ ist , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les in faith and truth .
but I don '@@ t permit a woman to te@@ ach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in qu@@ i@@ et@@ ness .
( but if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruc@@ t the brothers of these things , you will be a good ser@@ vant of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , no@@ ur@@ ished in the words of the faith , and of the good doc@@ tr@@ ine which you have followed .
for bo@@ dil@@ y exercise has some value , but go@@ d@@ lin@@ ess has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come .
for to this end we both la@@ bor and suffer re@@ pro@@ ach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Sav@@ ior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man desp@@ ise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in p@@ urity .
but if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an un@@ beli@@ ever .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temp@@ tation and a sn@@ are and many fo@@ ol@@ ish and harmful lu@@ sts , such as dro@@ wn men in ru@@ in and destruction .
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of ev@@ il . some have been led as@@ tra@@ y from the faith in their gre@@ ed , and have pi@@ er@@ ced themselves through with many sor@@ ro@@ ws .
I than@@ k God , whom I serve as my fore@@ fa@@ thers did , with a p@@ ure con@@ science . how un@@ ce@@ asing is my memory of you in my peti@@ tions , night and day
having been reminded of the sinc@@ ere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grand@@ mother Lo@@ is , and your mother E@@ un@@ ice , and , I am persu@@ aded , in you also .
for this cause , I remin@@ d you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the lay@@ ing on of my hands .
for this , I was appointed as a pre@@ acher , an A@@ pos@@ tle , and a teacher of the Gen@@ ti@@ les .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to fa@@ ith@@ ful men , who will be able to te@@ ach others also .
remin@@ d them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don '@@ t argue about words , to no profit , to the sub@@ ver@@ ting of those who hear .
tra@@ itors , head@@ strong , conce@@ ited , lov@@ ers of pleas@@ ure rather than lov@@ ers of God ;
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gen@@ ti@@ les might hear ; and I was delivered out of the m@@ outh of the lion .
and the Lord will deliver me from every ev@@ il work , and will preserve me for his heav@@ en@@ ly Kingdom ; to whom be the gl@@ ory fore@@ ver and ever . A@@ men .
to Tit@@ us , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mer@@ cy , and peace from God the F@@ ather and the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist our Sav@@ ior .
I left you in Cre@@ te for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint el@@ ders in every city , as I directed you ;
holding to the fa@@ ith@@ ful word which is according to the teaching , that he may be able to ex@@ h@@ ort in the sound doc@@ tr@@ ine , and to convic@@ t those who contra@@ dict him .
therefore though I have all bol@@ d@@ ness in Ch@@ r@@ ist to command you that which is appropriate ,
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you o@@ we to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed he@@ ir of all things , through whom also he made the wor@@ l@@ ds .
but which of the an@@ gel@@ s has he told at any time , " sit at my right hand , until I make your enem@@ ies the foot@@ st@@ ool of your feet ? "
God also testi@@ fying with them , both by signs and won@@ ders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spiri@@ t , according to his own will ?
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to gl@@ ory , to make the author of their sal@@ vation perfect through suffer@@ ings .
there is no cre@@ ature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are nak@@ ed and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
having then a great high pri@@ est , who has passed through the heav@@ ens , J@@ es@@ us , the Son of God , let us hold tigh@@ tly to our conf@@ ession .
the high pri@@ est can deal g@@ ently with those who are ignor@@ ant and going as@@ tra@@ y , because he himself is also surrounded with weak@@ ness .
so also Ch@@ r@@ ist di@@ d@@ n '@@ t g@@ lor@@ ify himself to be made a high pri@@ est , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his f@@ les@@ h , having offered up pray@@ ers and peti@@ tions with strong cr@@ ying and te@@ ars to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his go@@ dly fear ,
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , for he is a baby .
for the land which has dr@@ un@@ k the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a cro@@ p su@@ itable for them for whose sake it is also til@@ led , receives b@@ les@@ sing from God ;
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous , so as to forget your work and the la@@ bor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the sa@@ ints , and still do serve them .
in this way God , being determined to show more ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly to the he@@ ir@@ s of the promise the im@@ mut@@ ability of his coun@@ sel , inter@@ posed with an oath ;
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the patri@@ arch , gave a tenth out of the best sp@@ o@@ ils .
therefore he is also able to save to the ut@@ ter@@ most those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives fore@@ ver to make inter@@ c@@ ession for them .
for if he were on ear@@ th , he would not be a pri@@ est at all , seeing there are pri@@ ests who offer the gifts according to the law ;
they will not te@@ ach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' K@@ now the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
in that he says , " A new C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , " he has made the first old . but that which is becoming old and gro@@ ws aged is near to van@@ ishing away .
for a tab@@ ern@@ acle was prepared . in the first part were the lam@@ p@@ stand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Pla@@ ce .
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es are offered that are inc@@ ap@@ able , concerning the con@@ science , of making the wor@@ ship@@ per perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of go@@ ats and cal@@ ves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Pla@@ ce , having obtained eter@@ nal re@@ dem@@ ption .
for if the blood of go@@ ats and bul@@ ls , and the ashes of a he@@ if@@ er sp@@ rin@@ k@@ ling those who have been def@@ iled , sanc@@ ti@@ fy to the cle@@ ann@@ ess of the f@@ les@@ h :
it was necessary therefore that the cop@@ ies of the things in the heav@@ ens should be cleans@@ ed with these ; but the heav@@ en@@ ly things themselves with better sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es than these .
not for@@ sak@@ ing our own assemb@@ ling together , as the cust@@ om of some is , but ex@@ hor@@ ting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching .
for you both had comp@@ as@@ sion on me in my cha@@ ins , and jo@@ y@@ fully accepted the pl@@ undering of your pos@@ sessions , kno@@ wing that you have for yo@@ ur@@ selves a better possession and an en@@ during one in the heav@@ ens .
but we are not of those who shr@@ ink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the sou@@ l .
by faith , we understand that the uni@@ verse has been fra@@ med by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well ple@@ asing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called , obe@@ yed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance . he went out , not kno@@ wing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an ali@@ en in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , d@@ wel@@ ling in ten@@ ts , with I@@ sa@@ ac and Jac@@ o@@ b , the he@@ ir@@ s with him of the same promise .
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return .
conclu@@ ding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . F@@ ig@@ ur@@ atively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , Jac@@ o@@ b , when he was dying , b@@ les@@ sed each of the sons of Joseph , and wor@@ shi@@ ped , le@@ an@@ ing on the top of his staff .
by faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instruc@@ tions concerning his b@@ ones .
by faith , Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
by faith , Mos@@ es , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ,
by faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wr@@ ath of the king ; for he en@@ du@@ red , as seeing him who is in@@ visible .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on d@@ ry land . when the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans tried to do so , they were sw@@ allowed up .
looking to J@@ es@@ us , the author and perf@@ ec@@ ter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising its sh@@ ame , and has sat down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
for consider him who has en@@ du@@ red such con@@ tradi@@ ction of sin@@ ners against himself , that you don '@@ t grow we@@ ary , fa@@ in@@ ting in your so@@ ul@@ s .
and you have forgotten the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don '@@ t take lightly the ch@@ as@@ tening of the Lord , nor fa@@ int when you are re@@ proved by him ;
but if you are without discipline , of which all have been made par@@ tak@@ ers , then are you il@@ legitimate , and not children .
therefore lift up the hands that han@@ g down and the fe@@ e@@ ble k@@ ne@@ es ,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bit@@ ter@@ ness spr@@ inging up trouble you , and many be def@@ iled by it ;
for they could not stand that which was comman@@ ded , " If even an animal tou@@ ches the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned " ;
this ph@@ r@@ ase , " Y@@ et once more , " sig@@ ni@@ fies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain .
be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , " I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way for@@ sake you . "
for the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the hol@@ y place by the high pri@@ est as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp .
through him , then , let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continu@@ ally , that is , the fruit of li@@ ps which procla@@ im alle@@ gi@@ ance to his name .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great she@@ ph@@ er@@ d of the she@@ ep with the blood of an eter@@ nal C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , our Lord J@@ es@@ us ,
but if any of you lacks wis@@ dom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liber@@ ally and without re@@ pro@@ ach ; and it will be given to him .
but let him ask in faith , without any doub@@ ting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tos@@ sed .
for the sun ar@@ ises with the scor@@ ching wind , and Withers the gr@@ ass , and the f@@ lower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance per@@ is@@ hes . so also will the rich man fade away in his pursu@@ its .
but each one is temp@@ ted , when he is drawn away by his own l@@ ust , and en@@ ticed .
then the l@@ ust , when it has conce@@ ived , be@@ ars sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , brings forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the F@@ ather of lights , with whom can be no vari@@ ation , nor turning shadow .
for if anyone is a hear@@ er of the word and not a do@@ er , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mir@@ ror ;
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bri@@ dle his ton@@ gue , but dec@@ e@@ ives his heart , this man 's religion is wor@@ th@@ less .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be jud@@ ged by a law of freedom .
for in many things we all st@@ um@@ ble . if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t st@@ um@@ ble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bri@@ dle the whole body also .
and the ton@@ gue is a fire . the world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity among our members is the ton@@ gue , which def@@ il@@ es the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Ge@@ hen@@ na .
but if you have bitter je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and sel@@ fish ambi@@ tion in your heart , don '@@ t bo@@ ast and don '@@ t lie against the truth .
you ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers and ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ esses , don '@@ t you know that friendship with the world is en@@ mity with God ? who@@ ever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
your gold and your silver are cor@@ ro@@ ded , and their cor@@ ro@@ sion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your f@@ les@@ h like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
you have lived de@@ lic@@ ately on the ear@@ th , and taken your pleas@@ ure . you have no@@ ur@@ ished your hear@@ ts as in a day of sla@@ ughter .
D@@ on '@@ t gr@@ um@@ ble , brothers , against one another , so that you won '@@ t be jud@@ ged . be@@ hold , the judge stands at the door .
is any among you si@@ ck ? let him call for the el@@ ders of the assembly , and let them pra@@ y over him , ano@@ in@@ ting him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
and the pray@@ er of faith will he@@ al him who is si@@ ck , and the Lord will raise him up . if he has committed sin@@ s , he will be for@@ given .
Eli@@ j@@ ah was a man with a nature like ours , and he pray@@ ed ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly that it might not rain , and it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rain on the ear@@ th for three years and six months .
who through him are beli@@ ever@@ s in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him gl@@ ory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
but you are a chosen race , a royal pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , a hol@@ y nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may procla@@ im the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of him who called you out of d@@ ark@@ ness into his mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous light :
for this is the will of God , that by well @@@ -@@ @ doing you should put to sil@@ ence the ignor@@ ance of fo@@ ol@@ ish men :
who his own self b@@ ore our sin@@ s in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sin@@ s , might live to righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness ; by whose stri@@ pes you were he@@ aled .
let your beauty be not just the ou@@ tw@@ ard ad@@ or@@ ning of bra@@ i@@ ding the ha@@ ir , and of wearing je@@ wel@@ s of gold , or of putting on fine clo@@ thing ;
for the eyes of the Lord are on the righ@@ te@@ ous , and his e@@ ars open to their pray@@ er ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do ev@@ il . "
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with hum@@ il@@ ity and fear :
for to this end the Go@@ od News was pre@@ ached even to the dead , that they might be jud@@ ged indeed as men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live as to God in the spirit .
bel@@ ov@@ ed , don '@@ t be ast@@ on@@ ished at the fi@@ ery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a st@@ range thing happened to you .
for let none of you suffer as a mur@@ der@@ er , or a th@@ i@@ ef , or an ev@@ il do@@ er , or a med@@ d@@ ler in other men 's matters .
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . if it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don '@@ t obe@@ y the Go@@ od News of God ?
when the chief she@@ ph@@ er@@ d is revealed , you will receive the cro@@ wn of gl@@ ory that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fade away .
be so@@ ber and self @@@ -@@ @ controlled . be watch@@ ful . your ad@@ versary , the dev@@ il , walk@@ s around like a ro@@ aring lion , seeking whom he may dev@@ our .
but may the God of all grace , who called you to his eter@@ nal gl@@ ory by Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you .
Simon Peter , a ser@@ vant and A@@ pos@@ tle of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , to those who have obtained a like pre@@ ci@@ ous faith with us in the righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness of our God and Sav@@ ior , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist :
for we did not follow c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly dev@@ ised f@@ ables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but we were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
for if God di@@ d@@ n '@@ t spar@@ e an@@ gel@@ s when they sin@@ ned , but cast them down to Tar@@ tar@@ us , and committed them to p@@ its of d@@ ark@@ ness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and turning the cities of So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live un@@ go@@ dly ;
having eyes full of ad@@ ul@@ tery , and who can '@@ t ce@@ ase from sin ; en@@ tic@@ ing un@@ settled so@@ ul@@ s ; having a heart trained in gre@@ ed ; children of cur@@ sing ;
for@@ sak@@ ing the right way , they went as@@ tra@@ y , having followed the way of Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or , who lov@@ ed the wages of wrongdoing ;
for , ut@@ tering great s@@ wel@@ ling words of emp@@ tin@@ ess , they enti@@ ce in the lu@@ sts of the f@@ les@@ h , by licen@@ ti@@ ous@@ ness , those who are indeed escap@@ ing from those who live in er@@ ror ;
for if , after they have escaped the def@@ il@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ ior J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but the heav@@ ens that now are , and the ear@@ th , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of un@@ go@@ dly men .
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slow@@ ness ; but is patient with us , not w@@ ishing that any should per@@ ish , but that all should come to rep@@ ent@@ ance .
regard the patience of our Lord as sal@@ vation ; even as our bel@@ ov@@ ed brother Paul also , according to the wis@@ dom given to him , wrote to you ;
you therefore , bel@@ ov@@ ed , kno@@ wing these things be@@ fore@@ hand , be@@ w@@ are , lest being carried away with the er@@ ror of the w@@ ic@@ ked , you fall from your own stead@@ f@@ ast@@ ness .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Wor@@ d of life
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fel@@ low@@ ship with us . yes , and our fel@@ low@@ ship is with the F@@ ather , and with his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light , and in him is no d@@ ark@@ ness at all .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fel@@ low@@ ship with one another , and the blood of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , his Son , cleans@@ es us from all sin .
my little children , I write these things to you so that you may not sin . if anyone sin@@ s , we have a coun@@ sel@@ or with the F@@ ather , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the righ@@ te@@ ous .
one who says , " I know him , " and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , is a li@@ ar , and the truth is@@ n '@@ t in him .
but who@@ ever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perf@@ ected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
but he who ha@@ tes his brother is in the d@@ ark@@ ness , and walk@@ s in the d@@ ark@@ ness , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know where he is going , because the d@@ ark@@ ness has b@@ lin@@ ded his eyes .
D@@ on '@@ t love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone lov@@ es the world , the F@@ ather 's love is@@ n '@@ t in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is@@ n '@@ t the F@@ ather 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist is coming , even now many anti@@ ch@@ rist@@ s have ar@@ isen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
I have not written to you because you don '@@ t know the truth , but because you know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the li@@ ar but he who denies that J@@ es@@ us is the Ch@@ r@@ ist ? this is the Anti@@ ch@@ r@@ ist , he who denies the F@@ ather and the Son .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the dev@@ il . who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is not of God , neither is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother remains in death .
but who@@ ever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and clos@@ es his heart of comp@@ as@@ sion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
my little children , let 's not love in word only , neither with the ton@@ gue only , but in de@@ ed and truth .
this is his comman@@ d@@ ment , that we should believe in the name of his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , and love one another , even as he comman@@ ded .
you are of God , little children , and have overcome them ; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world .
by this God 's love was revealed in us , that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him .
we know and have believed the love which God has for us . God is love , and he who remains in love remains in God , and God remains in him .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have bol@@ d@@ ness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
for there are three who testify :
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eter@@ nal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
this is the bol@@ d@@ ness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he list@@ ens to us .
and if we know that he list@@ ens to us , whatever we ask , we know that we have the peti@@ tions which we have asked of him .
we know that who@@ ever is born of God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin , but he who was born of God keeps himself , and the ev@@ il one do@@ es@@ n '@@ t touch him .
grace , mer@@ cy , and peace will be with us , from God the F@@ ather , and from the Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , the Son of the F@@ ather , in truth and love .
this is love , that we should walk according to his comman@@ d@@ ments . this is the comman@@ d@@ ment , even as you heard from the beginning , that you should walk in it .
watch yo@@ ur@@ selves , that we don '@@ t lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
if anyone comes to you , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring this teaching , don '@@ t receive him into your house , and don '@@ t welcome him ,
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way wor@@ thy of God ,
now I desire to remin@@ d you , though you already know this , that the Lord , having sav@@ ed a people out of the land of Egypt , after@@ ward destroyed those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe .
b@@ les@@ sed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y , and keep the things that are written in it , for the time is at hand .
when I saw him , I fell at his feet like a dead man . he laid his right hand on me , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid . I am the first and the last ,
the my@@ ster@@ y of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand , and the seven golden lam@@ p@@ stands . the seven stars are the an@@ gel@@ s of the seven assemb@@ lies . the seven lam@@ p@@ stands are seven assemb@@ lies .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in E@@ ph@@ es@@ us write : " he who holds the seven stars in his right hand , he who walk@@ s among the seven golden lam@@ p@@ stands says these things :
he who has an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t says to the assemb@@ lies . to him who over@@ comes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Par@@ ad@@ ise of my God .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Sm@@ yr@@ na write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
" I know your works , op@@ pression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass , says these things :
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yo@@ urs perf@@ ected before my God .
he who over@@ comes will be ar@@ ray@@ ed in white gar@@ ments , and I will in no way blo@@ t his name out of the book of life , and I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
because you kept my command to en@@ dur@@ e , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in La@@ odi@@ cea write : " the A@@ men , the fa@@ ith@@ ful and Tru@@ e Wit@@ ness , the He@@ ad of God 's creation , says these things :
he who over@@ comes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my th@@ r@@ one , as I also over@@ came , and sat down with my F@@ ather on his th@@ r@@ one .
before the th@@ r@@ one was something like a sea of glass , similar to cr@@ y@@ st@@ al . in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one , and around the th@@ r@@ one were four living cre@@ atures full of eyes before and behind .
the first cre@@ ature was like a lion , and the second cre@@ ature like a cal@@ f , and the third cre@@ ature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying e@@ ag@@ le .
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the th@@ r@@ one , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven se@@ als .
no one in heav@@ en above , or on the ear@@ th , or under the ear@@ th , was able to open the book , or to look in it .
then he came , and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the th@@ r@@ one .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many an@@ gel@@ s around the th@@ r@@ one , the living cre@@ atures , and the el@@ ders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
and be@@ hold , a white hor@@ se , and he who sat on it had a bo@@ w . a cro@@ wn was given to him , and he came forth conqu@@ ering , and to conqu@@ er .
when he opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under@@ ne@@ ath the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of those who had been killed for the Wor@@ d of God , and for the testimony of the lam@@ b which they had .
after this , I saw four an@@ gel@@ s standing at the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , holding the four winds of the ear@@ th , so that no wind would blow on the ear@@ th , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another an@@ gel as@@ cen@@ d from the sun@@ rise , having the se@@ al of the living God . he cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice to the four an@@ gel@@ s to whom it was given to harm the ear@@ th and the sea ,
saying , " D@@ on '@@ t harm the ear@@ th , neither the sea , nor the trees , until we have sealed the bon@@ d@@ servants of our God on their fore@@ heads ! "
I heard the number of those who were sealed , one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , sealed out of every tri@@ be of the children of Israel :
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice , saying , " sal@@ vation be to our God , who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one , and to the lam@@ b ! "
all the an@@ gel@@ s were standing around the th@@ r@@ one , the el@@ ders , and the four living cre@@ atures ; and they fell on their faces before his th@@ r@@ one , and wor@@ shi@@ ped God ,
I told him , " My lor@@ d , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tri@@ bu@@ lation . they was@@ hed their rob@@ es , and made them white in the lam@@ b 's blood .
for the lam@@ b who is in the mid@@ st of the th@@ r@@ one she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds them , and leads them to spr@@ ings of waters of life . and God will wi@@ pe away every tear from their eyes . "
the smoke of the incen@@ se , with the pray@@ ers of the sa@@ ints , went up before God out of the an@@ gel 's hand .
the an@@ gel took the cen@@ ser , and he filled it with the fire of the alt@@ ar , and threw it on the ear@@ th . there followed th@@ unders , so@@ unds , ligh@@ t@@ nings , and an earthquake .
the third an@@ gel so@@ unded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a tor@@ ch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the spr@@ ings of the waters .
the name of the star is called " Wor@@ m@@ wood . " one third of the waters became wor@@ m@@ wood . many people died from the waters , because they were made bitter .
the fifth an@@ gel so@@ unded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the ear@@ th . the key to the p@@ it of the ab@@ y@@ ss was given to him .
then out of the smoke came forth loc@@ ust@@ s on the ear@@ th , and power was given to them , as the S@@ cor@@ p@@ ions of the ear@@ th have power .
they were told that they should not hurt the gr@@ ass of the ear@@ th , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those people who don '@@ t have God 's se@@ al on their fore@@ heads .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
they have over them as king the an@@ gel of the ab@@ y@@ ss . his name in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w is " Ab@@ add@@ on , " but in Greek , he has the name " A@@ poll@@ yon . "
by these three plagu@@ es were one third of man@@ kind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sul@@ f@@ ur , which proce@@ eded out of their m@@ ou@@ ths .
for the power of the hor@@ ses is in their m@@ ou@@ ths , and in their ta@@ ils . for their ta@@ ils are like Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and have heads , and with them they harm .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent of their murders , nor of their sor@@ cer@@ ies , nor of their sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , nor of their the@@ fts .
but in the days of the voice of the seventh an@@ gel , when he is about to sound , then the my@@ ster@@ y of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the pro@@ ph@@ ets .
the voice which I heard from heav@@ en , again speaking with me , said , " G@@ o , take the book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh . when I had e@@ aten it , my st@@ om@@ ach was made bitter .
when they have finished their testimony , the be@@ ast that comes up out of the ab@@ y@@ ss will make war with them , and overcome them , and kill them .
from among the peoples , tri@@ bes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th re@@ jo@@ ice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two pro@@ ph@@ ets tor@@ mented those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th .
the seventh an@@ gel so@@ unded , and great voices in heav@@ en followed , saying , " The k@@ ing@@ dom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Ch@@ r@@ ist . he will reign fore@@ ver and ever ! "
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a ro@@ d of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his th@@ r@@ one .
the great dra@@ g@@ on was thrown down , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , he who is called the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , the dec@@ e@@ i@@ ver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were thrown down with him .
they over@@ came him because of the lam@@ b 's blood , and because of the word of their testimony . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t love their life , even to death .
therefore re@@ jo@@ ice , heav@@ ens , and you who d@@ well in them . Wo@@ e to the ear@@ th and to the sea , because the dev@@ il has gone down to you , having great wr@@ ath , kno@@ wing that he has but a short time . "
when the dra@@ g@@ on saw that he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , he persec@@ uted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
the ser@@ p@@ ent spe@@ wed water out of his m@@ outh after the woman like a river , that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream .
the dra@@ g@@ on grew angry with the woman , and went away to make war with the rest of her se@@ ed , who keep God 's comman@@ d@@ ments and hold J@@ es@@ us ' testimony .
then I stood on the s@@ and of the sea . I saw a be@@ ast coming up out of the sea , having ten hor@@ ns and seven heads . on his hor@@ ns were ten crow@@ ns , and on his heads , b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ous names .
the be@@ ast which I saw was like a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his m@@ outh like the m@@ outh of a lion . the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , his th@@ r@@ one , and great authority .
all who d@@ well on the ear@@ th will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lam@@ b who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into cap@@ tivity , he will go into cap@@ tivity . if anyone is to be killed with the s@@ word , he must be killed . here is the en@@ dur@@ ance and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
he exercises all the authority of the first be@@ ast in his presence . he makes the ear@@ th and those who d@@ well in it to worship the first be@@ ast , whose fatal wo@@ und was he@@ aled .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the sla@@ ve , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their fore@@ heads ;
here is wis@@ dom . he who has understanding , let him calc@@ ulate the number of the be@@ ast , for it is the number of a man . his number is six hundred six@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ six .
I heard a sound from heav@@ en , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great Th@@ under . the sound which I heard was like that of har@@ p@@ ists playing on their har@@ ps .
the smoke of their tor@@ ment goes up fore@@ ver and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and who@@ ever receives the mark of his name .
the win@@ e@@ press was tro@@ dden outside of the city , and blood came out from the win@@ e@@ press , even to the bri@@ d@@ les of the hor@@ ses , as far as one thousand six hundred stadi@@ a .
the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temp@@ le , until the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s would be finished .
the first went , and p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the ear@@ th , and it became a harmful and ev@@ il sor@@ e on the people who had the mark of the be@@ ast , and who wor@@ shi@@ ped his image .
the second an@@ gel p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
people were scor@@ ched with great heat , and people b@@ las@@ phe@@ med the name of God who has the power over these plagu@@ es . they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t rep@@ ent and give him gl@@ ory .
the fifth p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l on the th@@ r@@ one of the be@@ ast , and his k@@ ing@@ dom was dar@@ ken@@ ed . they gn@@ a@@ wed their ton@@ gues because of the p@@ ain ,
the sixth p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l on the great river , the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates . its water was dri@@ ed up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sun@@ rise .
I saw coming out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t , three un@@ clean spir@@ its , something like fro@@ gs ;
for they are spir@@ its of dem@@ ons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited ear@@ th , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
" be@@ hold , I come like a th@@ i@@ ef . b@@ les@@ sed is he who wat@@ ches , and keeps his clo@@ th@@ es , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t walk nak@@ ed , and they see his sh@@ ame . "
the seventh p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the air . a l@@ oud voice came forth out of the temp@@ le of heav@@ en , from the th@@ r@@ one , saying , " It is done ! "
with whom the kings of the ear@@ th committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , and those who d@@ well in the ear@@ th were made dr@@ un@@ ken with the wine of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality . "
the woman was d@@ ressed in pur@@ ple and scar@@ let , and dec@@ ked with gold and pre@@ ci@@ ous stones and pe@@ ar@@ ls , having in her hand a golden c@@ up full of ab@@ omin@@ ations and the imp@@ ur@@ ities of the sexual im@@ mor@@ ality of the ear@@ th .
and on her fore@@ head a name was written , " my@@ ster@@ y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ L@@ O@@ N the great , the mother of the pro@@ stitu@@ tes and of the AB@@ O@@ MI@@ NAT@@ I@@ O@@ NS of the Earth . "
I saw the woman dr@@ un@@ ken with the blood of the sa@@ ints , and with the blood of the m@@ art@@ yr@@ s of J@@ es@@ us . when I saw her , I won@@ dered with great amaz@@ ement .
they are seven kings . five have fallen , the one is , the other has not yet come . when he comes , he must continue a little while .
the ten hor@@ ns that you saw are ten kings who have received no k@@ ing@@ dom as yet , but they receive authority as kings , with the be@@ ast , for one hour .
the ten hor@@ ns which you saw , and the be@@ ast , these will h@@ ate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her de@@ so@@ late , and will make her nak@@ ed , and will eat her f@@ les@@ h , and will bur@@ n her ut@@ ter@@ ly with fire .
for God has put in their hear@@ ts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their k@@ ing@@ dom to the be@@ ast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
for all the nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , the kings of the ear@@ th committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th grew rich from the ab@@ und@@ ance of her luxury . "
return to her just as she returned , and repay her double as she did , and according to her works . in the c@@ up which she mixed , mi@@ x to her double .
the kings of the ear@@ th , who committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality and lived w@@ ant@@ only with her , will we@@ ep and wa@@ il over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
in her was found the blood of pro@@ ph@@ ets and of sa@@ ints , and of all who have been sla@@ in on the ear@@ th . "
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments . for he has jud@@ ged the great pro@@ stitute , who cor@@ rupted the ear@@ th with her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , and he has av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us re@@ jo@@ ice and be exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad , and let us give the gl@@ ory to him . for the marriage of the lam@@ b has come , and his wife has made her@@ self ready . "
it was given to her that she would array her@@ self in bright , p@@ ure , fine lin@@ en : for the fine lin@@ en is the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the sa@@ ints .
he has on his gar@@ ment and on his th@@ igh a name written , " King of K@@ ings , and Lord of lor@@ ds . "
I saw the be@@ ast , and the kings of the ear@@ th , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the hor@@ se , and against his army .
he seized the dra@@ g@@ on , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , which is the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , who dec@@ e@@ ives the whole inhabited ear@@ th , and bound him for a thousand years ,
and he will come out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
they went up over the b@@ read@@ th of the ear@@ th , and surrounded the camp of the sa@@ ints , and the bel@@ ov@@ ed city . fire came down out of heav@@ en from God , and dev@@ oured them .
the dev@@ il who dec@@ e@@ ived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sul@@ f@@ ur , where the be@@ ast and the false pro@@ phe@@ t are also . they will be tor@@ mented day and night fore@@ ver and ever .
I saw a great white th@@ r@@ one , and him who sat on it , from whose face the ear@@ th and the heav@@ en fled away . there was found no place for them .
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and H@@ ades gave up the dead who were in them . they were jud@@ ged , each one according to his works .
if anyone was not found written in the book of life , he was cast into the lake of fire .
he will wi@@ pe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor cr@@ ying , nor p@@ ain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
its wall is one hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ four cu@@ bi@@ ts , by the measure of a man , that is , of an an@@ gel .
the city has no need for the sun , neither of the moon , to sh@@ ine , for the very gl@@ ory of God ill@@ umin@@ ated it , and its lam@@ p is the lam@@ b .
the nations will walk in its light . the kings of the ear@@ th bring the gl@@ ory and hon@@ or of the nations into it .
and they shall bring the gl@@ ory and the hon@@ or of the nations into it so that they may enter .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as cr@@ y@@ st@@ al , proce@@ eding out of the th@@ r@@ one of God and of the lam@@ b ,
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel who had shown me these things .
b@@ les@@ sed are those who do his comman@@ d@@ ments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
