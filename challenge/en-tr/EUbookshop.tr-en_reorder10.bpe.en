I have asked for the establishment of an aid register list@@ ing@@ all of the Commission 's decisions concerning State aid , and of a sco@@ re@@ board which would enab@@ le@@ it to be seen whether M@@ ember States are comp@@ lying with the State aid rules .
given their knowledge of the day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day functioning of markets , in particular those in mass @@@ -@@ @ market consumer goods , consum@@ er@@ organisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact .
such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which dist@@ ort competition .
Fo@@ re@@ x@@ amp@@ le , a price @@@ -@@ @ fixing agreement between Bak@@ ers in a given town will not ha@@ ve@@ any impact on the Community market , and European law is therefore not@@ applic@@ able to this kind of situation .
in some cases , this power is shared with the M@@ ember States " own competi@@ tion@@ authorities and law courts ( articles 81 and 82 ) , while in others it li@@ es@@ exclu@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ with the Commission ( mer@@ ger control , monitoring of State aid ) .
for the control of large @@@ -@@ @ scal@@ emer@@ gers , the M@@ ember States considered it necessary to create a one @@@ -@@ @ stop shop@@ .@@ They appointed the European Commission to that end .
in the area of its anti @@@ -@@ @ tru@@ st@@ operations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibi@@ tan agreement or@@ to issue an in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion@@ that a restric@@ tive practice be stopped , but also to im@@ pos@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ on firms found guilty of anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive conduct .

if an agreement fulfil@@ s the following conditions , it is vo@@ id : it is concluded between firms or " under@@ tak@@ ings " ;
under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exemp@@ ted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distribu@@ tion@@ agreements for example .
in this case , the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practice har@@ med firms outside the car@@ tel , which were system@@ atically exclu@@ de@@ d@@ from calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
after the new venture has been set up , businesses such as@@ banks , super@@ markets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers inter@@ active services via television . access to the services will be through a de@@ co@@ der .

on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Fren@@ ch@@ committee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 199@@ 8.@@ The committee , the C@@ F@@ O , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event th@@ at@@ included ticket sales .

Mer@@ gers which create or strengthen a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position , however , are prohibited by the Treaty in@@ order to prevent ensu@@ ing abuses . a firm is in ad@@ omin@@ ant position when it is able to act on them@@ ar@@ ket without having to take account of there@@ action of its competitors , suppliers or@@ customers .
it must be bor@@ ne in@@ mind that the Commission 's objective in the mer@@ ger control field is to preserve as@@ itu@@ ation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be agu@@ aran@@ tee of growth and thus of viable jobs .

( more than 90 % ) .
In@@ some cases , the mer@@ ger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen ad@@ omin@@ ant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a sol@@ u@@ tion@@ to the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
in both the Finnish and Austrian cases , the Com@@ mission@@ considered that the mer@@ ger of these retail cha@@ ins would have created ad@@ omin@@ ant position ; in the Finnish case , it decided to prohibi@@ t the trans@@ action , while in the Austrian case it accepted the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies , which cons@@ isted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors .
insurance policy@@ hol@@ ders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fro@@ m@@ the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .

investment aid in candidate countries is only a frac@@ tion of the level of investment assistance available to M@@ ember Sta@@ tes@@ 2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in dev@@ ising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of St@@ ruc@@ tural Fund programmes .

the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
as will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evalu@@ ations are often very closely inter@@ related ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
this chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evalu@@ ators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it reli@@ es ; the frequ@@ ency of external evaluation .
the " Standard for initial Te@@ acher Education : bench@@ mark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have at@@ tained at the end of their programmes .
either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
Germany : only evalu@@ ations of bac@@ hel@@ or '@@ s@@ - and master 's @@@ -@@ @ type programmes are used for the purpose of accredi@@ tation ( or re @@@ -@@ @ accredi@@ tation ) .

in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occur@@ s at regular inter@@ vals and another whose frequ@@ ency var@@ ies .
in teacher training col@@ leg@@ es , internal evaluation is carried out by the colle@@ ge council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
Cyprus : the F@@ ig@@ ure rela@@ tes solely to the internal evaluation of col@@ leg@@ es providing initial teacher education for primary educ@@ ation@@ .@@ Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the fac@@ ul@@ ties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should cons@@ ist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
chapter 3 -@@ Internal E@@ valu@@ ation of initial Te@@ acher Education
while the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is op@@ tional in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , intern@@ ally dev@@ ised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them .
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification fra@@ me@@ works for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the out@@ comes of the General Te@@ aching Council for Scot@@ land process will in turn fe@@ ed back into the internal quality assur@@ ance processes of the university .
however , there is no exp@@ li@@ cit mention of this having to happen - simply an expec@@ tation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curricul@@ um is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the course work@@ load and the teachers ' and ass@@ ist@@ ants " ability to deliver the course .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school pla@@ cements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the sel@@ f@@ evaluation report .
Greece : the information rela@@ tes to the law on quality assur@@ ance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
Alternati@@ vely , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evalu@@ ations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . in Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
the following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the avail@@ ability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
the level of funding may also v@@ ary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) .
this generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time , which var@@ ies from one country to the next .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation decisions , conditional or temporary accredi@@ tation may be awarded in the case of non @@@ -@@ @ compliance with accredi@@ tation requirements .
for schools in partnership with the institution concerned
Czech Republic : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occur@@ s prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursu@@ es several aims .
Germany : only the results of external evalu@@ ations to ( re@@ - ) acc@@ re@@ dit bac@@ hel@@ or 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nation@@ ally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illu@@ strated in the examples below .
figure 5.@@ 1 : types of provider and regulations for the accredi@@ tation and / or evaluation of in@@ service teacher education for general education ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) , 2005 / 06

Belgium ( B@@ E F@@ r ) : the information rela@@ tes solely to the In@@ stitu@@ t de la formation en cour@@ s de carri@@ è@@ re ( in @@@ -@@ @ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of in@@ service education at joint level of all public and private providers ( inter@@ r@@ é@@ se@@ au@@ x ) .
these two projects are currently being implemented .
in these two countries , regulations on both accredi@@ tation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
those referred to as " comp@@ ul@@ sory " in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.2 are common to all Aut@@ onomous Commun@@ ities , whereas those termed " op@@ tional " reflect the situation of just some of them .

Italy : ( 1 ) ref@@ ers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education , and ( 2 ) to teacher unions or associations and private @@@ -@@ @ sector training providers .
Lithuania : the draft regulations include almost all procedures on a comp@@ ul@@ sory basis . Slovenia : data refer to accredi@@ tation only .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . an au@@ dit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspec@@ torate specifically established for school education or in@@ service teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
in line with the decentral@@ ised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accredi@@ tation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Aut@@ onomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of in@@ service teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
as regards evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many L@@ ä@@ n@@ der have established or appointed central institu@@ tes or agencies for this task .
Finland : In@@ service teacher education of at least 30 EC@@ T@@ S provided by higher education institutions may be accredi@@ ted by the FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC at the request of the provider .
in Hungary , the process occur@@ s at three levels . at prepar@@ atory level , the organis@@ er of the programme asks an expert from the National Reg@@ ister of Ex@@ per@@ ts to give an opinion on it .
in a second stage , an expert from the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ ó@@ gu@@ s @@@ -@@ @ t@@ ov@@ á@@ b@@ b@@ k@@ é@@ p@@ z@@ é@@ si Ak@@ kredi@@ t@@ á@@ ci@@ ó@@ s Tes@@ tü@@ let ( In @@@ -@@ @ service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining Ac@@ credi@@ ting B@@ ody ) evalu@@ ates the programme in accordance with a guide@@ line based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practi@@ sing teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during after@@ no@@ ons , week@@ ends or summer .
an inspec@@ torate for in@@ service teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining ) , where it particip@@ ates in evaluation along with other bodies .
in the French Community of Belgium , the In@@ stitu@@ t de la formation en cour@@ s de carri@@ ere , a community @@@ -@@ @ wide institution , organis@@ es and evalu@@ ates in@@ service teacher education , notably through its operators .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.@@ 4 are not usually covered .

In@@ service teacher education abroad
the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accredi@@ tation of in@@ service teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
furthermore , the Sul@@ i@@ Nova K@@ ht ( a non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisation ) monitors in@@ service teacher education programmes by means of a sel@@ f@@ evaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervis@@ es and approves the National Centre of In@@ service Tra@@ ining activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educ@@ ational Auth@@ orities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of in@@ service teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the R@@ EA
the results of the accredi@@ tation and evaluation of in@@ service education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( C@@ hap@@ ter 4 ) .
in the Czech Republic , accredi@@ tation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Commission .
the Ministry has the right to control the accredi@@ ted programmes during the period of accredi@@ tation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Poland , negative evaluation findings can result in the accredi@@ tation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for in@@ service courses to be chann@@ elled into other training institutions .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @@@ -@@ @ making with respect to the goals , processes and instruc@@ tors of the programmes .
in the Netherlands , accredi@@ tation results are published on the website of the N@@ eder@@ lands @@@ -@@ @ Vla@@ am@@ se Ac@@ credi@@ tati@@ e Organ@@ is@@ ati@@ e ( N@@ V@@ AO , or Ac@@ credi@@ tation Organisation of The Netherlands and F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adap@@ t procedures for evalu@@ ating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
the introduction of the two @@@ -@@ @ cycle ( bac@@ hel@@ or / master ) structure in several L@@ ä@@ n@@ der in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
later , it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that , in order to be granted this recognition , courses had to be struc@@ tured in mo@@ du@@ les , accredi@@ ted and therefore evalu@@ ated be@@ fore@@ hand .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and comp@@ ul@@ sory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the defin@@ ition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of in@@ service teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curricul@@ um of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be at@@ tained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredi@@ ted or certi@@ fied .

monitoring the drug situation
starting from a highly het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous group of drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories across different contin@@ ents , the en@@ deavour is to extr@@ act the essence of their experience and to trans@@ mit the final result in such a way that it can be re@@ interpreted in other re@@ alities and conditions .
since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @@@ -@@ @ based policy @@@ -@@ @ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership ( 3 ) , and neighbourhood countries ( 4 ) that wish and / or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs , such as the Inter@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Dru@@ gs Ob@@ ser@@ vatory C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS , to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and / or to consolidate their national obser@@ vat@@ ories ;

we must inform the re@@ ader of the following in relation to this publication :
• we do not offer a single model to be cop@@ ied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sor@@ ts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a struc@@ tured analysis of each national context .
a national drugs observatory ( N@@ D@@ O ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information concerning drugs and

in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transp@@ os@@ ition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .

it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " in C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's five key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators ;
however it is important to bear in mind that kno@@ wing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are mer@@ ely long @@@ -@@ @ term goals .
• other national organisations for some ad ho@@ c surveys and / or qual@@ it@@ ative studies among drug users • laborat@@ ories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences • the national drugs observatory in its role of co@@ ordinator of the whole network .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
• Car@@ ry out a formal review of data quality and avail@@ ability at national level with an expert panel • compar@@ e results with international guidelines and standards
• working with quanti@@ t@@ ative data ; • analy@@ sing qual@@ it@@ ative information ; • interpre@@ ting and putting together all sources of information .

• interpre@@ ting statistical data and placing it in context ; • providing in@@ sight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug @@@ -@@ @ using pat@@ ter@@ ns ; • assessing the context in which interven@@ tions may be more effective ; and • helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interven@@ tions ; • understanding new drug using phenom@@ ena ; • providing in@@ sight into drugs markets .

to ensure sustainability and " buy @@@ -@@ @ in , " it is vital that the N@@ D@@ O ensu@@ res that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stak@@ ehol@@ ders and audiences - both at national and sup@@ ran@@ ational level .
the reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stak@@ ehol@@ ders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its form@@ at , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
once the stak@@ ehol@@ ders have been identified , it is necessary for the N@@ D@@ O to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
information covering a wide range of technical and meth@@ od@@ ological issues , struc@@ tured and well documented contents , in a not @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ detailed form@@ at ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a comp@@ il@@ ation of documents ) .

• clar@@ ify the process for delivery and identify the end benef@@ i ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national co@@ ordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs co@@ ordinating body , et@@ c . )
in countries where the N@@ D@@ O is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug co@@ ordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 7 ) :
when the N@@ D@@ O is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confi@@ dential note to the national drug co@@ ordinating body ( N@@ DC ) - if relevant - or trans@@ mits the information through the normal channels .

• ensure that its partners der@@ ive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system : it is important partners are motivated to provide the data , as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected ;
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confron@@ tation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?

however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the cho@@ ices to be made .

• within national drug Co@@ ordination bodies or under government departments ; • within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health ; • within the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security ; • within a university or a non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisation .
the latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the N@@ D@@ O will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ D@@ O 's capacity to deliver out@@ puts and be accountable for the use of funds .
if the N@@ D@@ O is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
there are no institutional models to be cop@@ ied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to form@@ alise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concep@@ ts and principles that remain valid ir@@ respective of country or region .
the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission ( C@@ IC@@ AD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organ@@ ization of American States ( O@@ AS ) in 1986 as the western hem@@ is@@ phere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D report sub@@ stance use among students in 35 countries
sum@@ m@@ ary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bun@@ des@@ l@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
country samp@@ le siz@@ es were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
the total amount of alcohol consu@@ med during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequ@@ encies .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man and the United Kingdom .
however , there are countries in which many students report heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days , while they were rather low on the ranking list for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness for the same period .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more even@@ ly distributed pat@@ tern , with spir@@ its as the most important type , con@@ stitut@@ ing about one third of the total consumption .
on average 43 % of the ES@@ PA@@ D students reported heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days , and this was more common among boys ( 47 % ) than among girls ( 39 % ) .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
there were gender differences in the frequ@@ encies of dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ES@@ PA@@ D level there were no gender differences .
the most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the pro@@ portion of students reporting heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i@@ .@@ e@@ . by 31 percentage points .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
countries in which many students report dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness this often include Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
in the two top @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Is@@ le of Man ) one in six students reported can@@ na@@ bis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular can@@ na@@ bis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
countries where many students report past 30 days can@@ na@@ bis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try can@@ na@@ bis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illi@@ cit drugs at least once during their lif@@ etime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from can@@ na@@ bis were found , and the percentage of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users in a population correspon@@ ds to the can@@ na@@ bis use pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report non@@ pres@@ cri@@ bed use of these drugs ( 8 % ver@@ sus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illi@@ cit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ES@@ PA@@ D countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of can@@ na@@ bis between 2003 and 2007 .
students from Cyprus , the Is@@ le of Man , Malta and Slovenia report the highest lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ hal@@ ants in 2007 ( 16 % ) , while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Ukraine .
the rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lif@@ etime use relatively well across countries .
it is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substan@@ ces .
the overall sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the vari@@ able in focus .
the up@@ ward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lif@@ etime use of illi@@ cit drugs - predominantly can@@ na@@ bis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the vari@@ ables .
sum@@ m@@ ary western Europe and countries dis@@ playing increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illi@@ cit drug use is rising .
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult cho@@ ices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .

it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being ca@@ us@@ ally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all high@@ pre@@ val@@ ence countries .

among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 , can@@ na@@ bis was the primary reason for refer@@ r@@ al to treatment in about 15 % of all cases , making it the next most com@@ mon@@ ly reported drug after heroin .
the emer@@ gence of m@@ C@@ P@@ P illu@@ stra@@ tes the fact that those involved in the production of illi@@ cit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chem@@ ic@@ als that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to poten@@ ti@@ ate or modi@@ fy the effects of M@@ D@@ MA ( ec@@ st@@ asy ) .

first , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 in June 2005 .
it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , will present annual progress re@@ views .
finally , the process will be particip@@ ative , involving an evaluation ste@@ ering group whose task will be to define the meth@@ od@@ ology , output and provisional cal@@ end@@ ar .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the ste@@ ering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , as well as representatives of the M@@ ember States .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe gives a precise defin@@ ition of serious offences and covers the laundering of the proceeds of such offences , including financing of terrorist activities .
direc@@ tive 91 / 3@@ 08 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modi@@ fied in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among M@@ ember States .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
possession of more than 10 dos@@ es must be charged under Sec@@ tion 17@@ 2 , which , depending on the ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
in addition , the age of criminal li@@ ability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offen@@ ders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guide@@ line on can@@ na@@ bis , " according to which possession of up to 10 gram@@ s of can@@ na@@ bis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
see " The role of the quanti@@ ty in the prosecution of drug offences , " an EL@@ D@@ D legal report , and T@@ able 1 in " illi@@ cit drug use in the EU : legislative approaches , " an
other sent@@ encing statistics showed that the w@@ ai@@ ving of reports as stat@@ ut@@ ory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convic@@ tions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by ste@@ aling ( Ki@@ vi@@ v@@ u@@ ori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed comp@@ ul@@ sory treatment , effectively decreas@@ ing the involvement of the prob@@ ation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sent@@ encing , or avo@@ idance of sent@@ encing , give a far more accur@@ ate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 2@@ a ) .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
in most EU M@@ ember States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
over the same five @@@ -@@ @ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .
countries where this is the case , can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related offences in 2004 accounted for 34 @@@ -@@ @ 87 % of all drug law offences .
chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first in@@ sight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to under@@ pin , support and explain to the population at large the ration@@ ale under@@ lying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical gu@@ idance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in France and Ireland ) .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .

although the overall provision of sub@@ stitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indic@@ ations of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .

the reduction of dru@@ g@@ related deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
according to the reports by N@@ F@@ P@@ s ( 35 ) , objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of sy@@ ner@@ gy at the European level . besides drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , target groups include sex workers and prisoners .
in the new central European M@@ ember States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies wi@@ den the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
a similar specialised programme for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 action plan calls on M@@ ember States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social re@@ integration programmes . "
although social measures are still a less well @@@ -@@ @ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interven@@ tions combin@@ ing treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug us@@ er rehabilitation .
non@@ e@@ theless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
the service most com@@ mon@@ ly offered to home@@ less problem drug users is access to " gener@@ ic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries comb@@ ine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from M@@ ember States conver@@ ge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and prec@@ ar@@ ious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social re@@ integration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Sen@@ eg@@ al , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports , 2005 ; W@@ C@@ O , 2005 ; IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 6@@ a ) .

the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illi@@ cit drugs , with the standard time fra@@ mes , and frequ@@ ency of use .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 4@@ 0.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lif@@ etime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
50 % in the Czech Republic , Spain and France (
countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @@@ -@@ @ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ran@@ ges from 32 % to 40 % .
the lowest lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
other countries are also working on scal@@ es to assess intensive forms of can@@ na@@ bis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is promoting collaboration in this area .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @@@ -@@ @ on@@ set users ( pre@@ - to mid @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ o@@ le@@ sc@@ ence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( V@@ on Sy@@ dow et al . , 2002 ; Ch@@ en et al . , 2005 ) .

this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interven@@ tions may take the form of coun@@ selling , " can@@ na@@ bis courses " or even self @@@ -@@ @ help websites .
for example , the German website @@@ -@@ @ based coun@@ selling programme , Qu@@ it the S@@ hit ( www.@@ dru@@ g@@ com@@ .@@ de ) , is an innovative approach , using te@@ lem@@ atics , for can@@ na@@ bis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .

demands for treatment related to ec@@ st@@ asy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ec@@ st@@ asy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about ac@@ ute or chron@@ ic health problems requiring medical interven@@ tions relating to the use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces by young people .
for example , in the United Kingdom , during the early 200@@ 0s , the number of shops selling hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms increased , and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stal@@ ls across the country .
this is a common feature of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to conf@@ ine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for rec@@ re@@ ational purposes ( 130 ) .
in March 2001 the UN drug control system added G@@ H@@ B to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU M@@ ember States have been up@@ dating their legislation on this sub@@ stance .
the shortage of pre@@ val@@ ence data on G@@ H@@ B and ket@@ am@@ ine suggests that use of these substan@@ ces has stabil@@ ised at low levels in most countries .

the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely un@@ explo@@ red , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
as cocaine use can escal@@ ate quickly , brief interven@@ tions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth expl@@ oring .
for example , one study of an innovative out@@ reach treatment programme in Rot@@ ter@@ dam ( Hen@@ s@@ ken@@ s , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for tre@@ ating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .

since the mid@@ 1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of ep@@ i@@ demic spread of HIV among in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .

the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA figures include a few deaths among those over 65 years , with only seven countries reporting that more than 5 % of cases fall into this age group ( 20@@ 3 ) .

deaths due to bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine po@@ is@@ oning appear to be rare , a fact that is attributed to the ag@@ on@@ ist @@@ -@@ @ ant@@ ag@@ on@@ ist pharmac@@ ological character@@ isti@@ cs of this drug .
since 2000 , many EU countries have reported decreas@@ es in the numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , possibly related to increases in treatment avail@@ ability and harm reduction initiatives , although dec@@ lines in the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use may also be important .

although interpre@@ tations should be made with caution , because of the relatively low numbers of dru@@ g@@ related deaths in some countries , these pat@@ ter@@ ns could be related to the trends in heroin in@@ j@@ ection ( 20@@ 9 ) .

annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe meth@@ ad@@ one sub@@ stitution treatment is not currently considered a major response to reduce over@@ d@@ ose deaths .
however , activities falling into this spectrum of responses were rarely used in 13 countries and not in use at all in another five ( Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and Sweden ) .
non@@ e@@ theless , it is linked to the various concep@@ ts of addi@@ ction by the understanding that someone be@@ having in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem us@@ er . "
while the P@@ D@@ U indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem , it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today 's more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous
in terms of the current implementation of the P@@ D@@ U indicator across the EU , countries have adap@@ ted the defin@@ ition to cover the prac@@ tic@@ alities of their local situation and the position is therefore het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorpor@@ ated into the monitoring exercise , beyond P@@ D@@ U monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods comple@@ ment population survey work , which , for a range of meth@@ od@@ ological and practical reasons , is less su@@ itable for esti@@ m@@ ating the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use that is of low pre@@ val@@ ence , sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ sed and largely hidden .
under these circumstances , any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include pol@@ y@@ drug use as one of these separately meas@@ ured components .
a second drug with a functional or pharmac@@ ological ration@@ ale is not con@@ fined to simultane@@ ous use but may also be used consecu@@ tively , as a replacement or as a comple@@ mentary drug .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
moreover , it should be bor@@ ne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
these sor@@ ts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the compos@@ ite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can en@@ comp@@ ass the target concept .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging M@@ ember States to develop and expand harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction activities .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most com@@ mon@@ ly consu@@ med illi@@ cit drug by young and very young people .
drug use among those who are developing both physi@@ cally and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompan@@ ying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
although some M@@ ember States have introduced sch@@ e@@ mes to di@@ ver@@ t offen@@ ders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant

Co@@ ordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new inter@@ governmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine inter@@ diction .
each year , around 400 cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related deaths are reported in Europe , and there is a suspicion that cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular deaths in which cocaine has been an ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating factor may go largely un@@ detec@@ ted .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher pro@@ portion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tri@@ pled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
increased pre@@ val@@ ence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
across Europe , H@@ C@@ V rates are high among in@@ j@@ ecting populations , and studies show that young in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @@@ -@@ @ using care@@ ers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems ar@@ ising from lack of security .
reductions in cultiv@@ ation can be achieved quickly but are rever@@ sed equally quickly .
over@@ d@@ ose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoi@@ dable mortality among young adults .
of drug treatment data and drug over@@ dos@@ es suggests that the heroin @@@ -@@ @ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
this approach , which has been in place in other M@@ ember States ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benef@@ ited from the experience of earlier ones .
a noti@@ ce@@ able trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two comple@@ mentary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the new regulation clar@@ i@@ fies the countries to which the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA can transfer its know @@@ -@@ @ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interven@@ tions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interven@@ tions and the importance given
there is also some activity in the area of developing inde@@ x@@ es designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
the concep@@ tu@@ alisation of both instruments has involved interesting meth@@ od@@ ological developments and has allowed a first in@@ sight into the use of overall inde@@ x@@ es to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
a first ob@@ servation is that such instruments can be useful for a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al follow @@@ -@@ @ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alised with the analysis of individual indicators within the inde@@ x@@ es .
at the regional or local level , drug Co@@ ordination agencies and / or drug co@@ ordin@@ ators exist in most countries .
this figure is likely to under@@ estimate the full extent of drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture , given the high level of under @@@ -@@ @ reporting . the six countries included in T@@ able 1 account for 76 % of the total public expendi@@ ture reported by EU M@@ ember States

one important element in this picture is the different can@@ na@@ bis products now available on the European market . histor@@ ically , three main forms of can@@ na@@ bis have been common in Europe : can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in ; her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ; and , far less frequently , can@@ na@@ bis oil .

an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national report ) where a relatively high level of experim@@ entation was reported in the 197@@ 0s among cons@@ cripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 197@@ 0s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
and , the approach of restric@@ ting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any prec@@ ision .
however , this still provides only a b@@ lun@@ t tool for identi@@ fying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of can@@ na@@ bis .

clients entering treatment for use of sti@@ mul@@ ants other than cocaine are on average around 27 years old ( 26 if they enter treatment for the first time ) and used the drug for the first time at an average age of 19 ( 83 ) .

imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversi@@ fying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .
estimates of cocaine use for shorter reference periods ( 98 ) suggest that in the last year , of the 3.5 million ( 2.@@ 4 % ) young adults who have used the drug , 1.5 million ( 1 % ) have used it in the last month .
the reported increase in last year cocaine pre@@ val@@ ence in Spain since 2001 can be attributed to increased levels of use in the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 24 age group , rather than across 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 year ol@@ ds as a whole .

generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( T@@ DI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requ@@ esting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 1@@ 23 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .

a strong voice from Europe in an important year for ref@@ le@@ ction and policy formation the us@@ er is often difficult , and M@@ ember States v@@ ary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflec@@ tions on how drug policies have performed to date , and what direc@@ tions should be pursu@@ ed in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly can@@ na@@ bis users , the lik@@ elihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinc@@ tion has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .

drug use prevention : evidence base gro@@ ws but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving re@@ integration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tic value .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of a more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous population of drug users .
the portal , which includes a prevention mo@@ dul@@ e , provides an over@@ view of the latest evidence on programme e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interven@@ tions .

local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conce@@ al and do not necess@@ itate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more rec@@ re@@ ational basis .
however , pat@@ ter@@ ns of sti@@ mul@@ ant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most com@@ mon@@ ly used sti@@ mul@@ ant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fif@@ ty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with in@@ put from the EU M@@ ember States , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in C@@ hap@@ ter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will ren@@ ew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will ren@@ ew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will ren@@ ew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
these expenditures are not necessarily la@@ bel@@ led as dru@@ g@@ related in official accoun@@ tancy documents .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking off@@ ence .
most of the expenditures identified were originally " la@@ bel@@ led " as drug related , and were generally tr@@ ac@@ ed back by exha@@ us@@ tively re@@ viewing official accoun@@ tancy documents , thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all wi@@ den the scope for direc@@ ting drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established

though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

in the five @@@ -@@ @ year period 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , the number of drug law offences involving can@@ na@@ bis increased or remained stable in most reporting countries , resulting in an overall average increase of 34 % in the European Union ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .
based on reports from 25 M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an over@@ view of the organisation of dru@@ g@@ related research in European countries .
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA through its network of Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .

in addition to public@@ ations speci@@ alising in illi@@ cit drugs and addi@@ ction , articles on illi@@ cit drug use are also published in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als from a wide array of discipl@@ ines and in professional magaz@@ ines .
several research studies have shown that interven@@ tions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environ@@ ments and reduce social exclu@@ sion , also have a moder@@ ating effect on later sub@@ stance use ( T@@ ou@@ m@@ bour@@ ou et al . , 2007 ) .

around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .

in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
due to the specific profile of the Bal@@ tic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
financial support for harm@@ reduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malar@@ ia and tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users and in prison sett@@ ings .

Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of in@@ mates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of in@@ mates have in@@ j@@ ected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social re@@ integration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
however , there is no such enti@@ t@@ lement if the offen@@ der is expected to be released within three months or is considered un@@ fit or not motivated for treatment .
in the early and mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high pre@@ val@@ ence , whereas the European nor@@ m was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports ) . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Ni@@ ger@@ ia , An@@ g@@ ola ) , south @@@ -@@ @ east Asia ( Tha@@ il@@ and ) , south @@@ -@@ @ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americ@@ as ( Col@@ om@@ bia , J@@ am@@ a@@ ica ) ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
can@@ na@@ bis can be cultiv@@ ated in a wide range of environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultiv@@ ated in 17@@ 2 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .

after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 03 , the number of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seiz@@ ures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities inter@@ cep@@ ted increased until 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 , but there@@ after have been declining .
in the recovery of about 2.3 million can@@ na@@ bis plants ( and 22 tonnes of can@@ na@@ bis plants ( 64 % accounted by Spain ) .
the data on European drug seiz@@ ures mentioned in this chapter can be found in T@@ ables S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 1 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 2 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 3 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 4 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 5 and S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 6 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
in 2006 , the reported TH@@ C content of res@@ in samples ran@@ ged from 2.3 % to 18.@@ 4 % , while that of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ran@@ ged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the meth@@ od@@ ology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conserv@@ atively estimated that can@@ na@@ bis has been used at least once ( lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ ye@@ ar@@ - ol@@ ds ( see T@@ able 2 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .
generally being reported among the 15@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) have ever used can@@ na@@ bis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
group have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
for example , the rati@@ o of mal@@ es to fem@@ al@@ es among those reporting use of can@@ na@@ bis in the last year ran@@ ged from 6.@@ 4 mal@@ es for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy .
as with lif@@ etime experience , there is a wide vari@@ ation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually un@@ reported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among mal@@ es .
after tobacco and alcohol , can@@ na@@ bis also continues to be the psy@@ cho@@ active sub@@ stance most com@@ mon@@ ly used by school students .
ever in lif@@ etime use of can@@ na@@ bis by 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experim@@ enting with this sub@@ stance often occur@@ s at or around this age .
data from the 2005 / 06 H@@ B@@ SC survey of 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds showed large vari@@ ation in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use across 27 countries .
esti@@ m@@ ating intensive and long @@@ -@@ @ term pat@@ ter@@ ns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .
the comparison shows that , on average , students who have used can@@ na@@ bis are more likely to have used other substan@@ ces .
although among can@@ na@@ bis users the last month pre@@ val@@ ence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and bin@@ ge drinking among can@@ na@@ bis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
in an Australian study , 92 % of long @@@ -@@ @ term can@@ na@@ bis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them jud@@ ged to be dependent at the time of the study .
a follow @@@ -@@ @ up study carried out one year later suggested that , among long @@@ -@@ @ term users , measures of can@@ na@@ bis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time ( S@@ wi@@ ft et al . , 2000 ) .
a comparison of H@@ B@@ SC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreas@@ ing trend in both lif@@ etime and other more frequent can@@ na@@ bis use among 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , can@@ na@@ bis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
client pro@@ files in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . those vari@@ ations may be explained by differences in pre@@ val@@ ence of intensive can@@ na@@ bis use , drug treatment organisation or refer@@ r@@ al practices .
overall , primary can@@ na@@ bis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequ@@ ency of use : those who use it occasi@@ onally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
in addition , Belgium , Germany , France , the Netherlands and Switzerland are collabor@@ ating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family @@@ -@@ @ based treatment for problematic can@@ na@@ bis use ( In@@ can@@ t ) ( 58 ) .
these Inter@@ net@@ based services are targeted at young people and focus on problems related to alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis .

over the period 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , with the exception of the Czech Republic , Spain and Romania , the retail price of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine was reported to have fallen in all 16 countries reporting sufficient data for analysis .
the data on European drug seiz@@ ures mentioned in this chapter can be found in T@@ ables S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 11 to S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 18 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
in contrast , overall , consumption levels of syn@@ thetic hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drugs such as ly@@ ser@@ gic ac@@ id di@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ide ( L@@ SD ) are lower and have been largely stable for a considerable period .
higher pre@@ val@@ ence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of , in simple terms at least , two distinc@@ t consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns . in a limited number of
Sti@@ mul@@ ant markets in Europe : the relative pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine or amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines in seiz@@ ures and population surveys , and the pro@@ portion of drug users in treatment reporting these substan@@ ces as primary drugs
last year use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines in this age group ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting pre@@ val@@ ence estimates of between 0.@@ 7 % and 1.9 % .
for example , rec@@ re@@ ational and less intensive and damaging pat@@ ter@@ ns of use among socially wel@@ lin@@ tegrated users can co@@ exist with intensive use among more margin@@ alised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risk@@ y mo@@ des of administration , such as in@@ j@@ ection and smoking .
only one M@@ ember State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 1@@ 2000 and 2@@ 2000 problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users ( 4.3 to 7.@@ 9 cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 , aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the country .

in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .
among young adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) , lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence estimates area little higher ( 0.@@ 3 % to 7.@@ 1 % ) , although lower pre@@ val@@ ence levels are reported among the 15@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use ( last 12 months ) among young adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 ) in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom declined substan@@ tially between 1996 ( 6.5 % ) and 2002 ( 3.@@ 1 % ) , with the figures remaining
stable there@@ after . a marked increase in amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use is reported in Denmark between 1994 and 2000 , but the results of the 2005 survey indicate a decrease in the use of this sub@@ stance since the beginning of this decade ( 73
countries with sufficient data on last year pre@@ val@@ ence of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use among the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 age group , three report a decrease of 15 % or more , four report stabilisation and seven report an increase of 15 % or more .
data from a few countries suggest that cocaine could be replacing amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and ec@@ st@@ asy among some sectors of the drug @@@ -@@ @ using population . this may be the
9@@ 94 tonnes of p@@ ure cocaine hydro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide for the year 2007 , of which Col@@ om@@ bia accounted for 61 % , Per@@ u 29 % and Bol@@ iv@@ ia 10 % .
analysis of the number of laborat@@ ories disman@@ tled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before expor@@ tation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .

similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.@@ 7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
ever in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students is 2 % or lower in most countries , rising to 4 % in Spain and 5 % in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 89
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .
a multi @@@ -@@ @ city European study with targeted samples of cocaine users in nine cities ( Pr@@ in@@ z@@ le@@ ve et al . , 2004 ) found
overall the estimated lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the U@@ SA .
the second is a more margin@@ alised group of clients who are typically smoking or in@@ j@@ ecting cocaine ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either cr@@ ack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .
frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tions than non@@ users ( Qu@@ res@@ hi et al . , 2001 ) .
following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several M@@ ember States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adap@@ ting their traditionally op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ oriented services to the var@@ ied cocaine and cr@@ ack @@@ -@@ @ using populations .
Mo@@ da@@ fin@@ il , a central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ant , has shown particularly promising results as a psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ant sub@@ stitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential sub@@ stitute drugs ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . d @@@ -@@ @ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ) , its abuse li@@ ability is low ( My@@ ri@@ ck et al . , 2004 ) .
of the M@@ ember States that report high pre@@ val@@ ence levels of cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evalu@@ ated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e clin@@ ical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als ( ar@@ ip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and ro@@ pin@@ ir@@ ole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .
according to a recent Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom report ( nice , 2007 ) , cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .

the amount of heroin inter@@ cep@@ ted in an average seiz@@ ure var@@ ied greatly between these two countries , with the size of the average seiz@@ ure in Turkey being 100 times that reported for the United Kingdom , reflecting different positions in the supply chain ( F@@ ig@@ ure 6 ) .
however , large seiz@@ ures of mor@@ ph@@ ine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; UNODC , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .
global seiz@@ ures of ac@@ etic an@@ hy@@ dri@@ de ( used in the illi@@ cit manufac@@ ture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 lit@@ res in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 lit@@ res ) and Col@@ om@@ bia ( 8 800 lit@@ res ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 lit@@ res ) ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 8@@ b ) .
Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
for example , in some countries where problem op@@ i@@ oid use has histor@@ ically pre@@ dominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use at national level during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 range roughly between one and six cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use of between four and five cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 of the population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 can be der@@ ived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it imp@@ lies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
treatment found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for inci@@ dence esti@@ mation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( S@@ cal@@ ia Tom@@ ba et al . , 2008 ) .
most drug clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 23 % ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 18 % ) .
of the 3@@ 87 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one : mainly bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , pain@@ kil@@ lers and other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 112 ) .
figure 8 : estimates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use ( cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ) an increase in the pro@@ portion of pol@@ y@@ drug users among heroin clients and arise in the number of clients using op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
among op@@ i@@ oid users entering out@@ patient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower pro@@ portion report in@@ j@@ ecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .
see T@@ ables P@@ D@@ U @@@ -@@ @ 1@@ 04 , T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 4 , T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 5 and T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 17 ( part V ) in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
the var@@ ying levels of new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initi@@ ation as well as increasing in@@ j@@ ecting inci@@ dence among the younger or the older populations .
a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users and the reported number of treat@@ ments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving sub@@ stitution treatment .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .
about half of op@@ i@@ oid users seeking treatment report initi@@ ation before the age of 20 and around one third between the age of 20 and 24 years ; first use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids after the age of 25 is un@@ common ( 120
a bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine / n@@ alo@@ x@@ one combination was launched on the EU market in 2006 as an alternative to bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine alone , with the aim of reducing the potential and attr@@ ac@@ tiveness for in@@ j@@ ecting use .
pres@@ cri@@ ption of medical heroin ( di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine ) , as a treatment option for chron@@ ic treatment @@@ -@@ @ res@@ istant op@@ i@@ oid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 8@@ 15 clients in 2006 ) , the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine according to a special regulation .
additionally , a r@@ and@@ om@@ ised trial of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( R@@ I@@ O@@ T@@ T ) is currently under@@ way in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom which will assess the effectiveness of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , in@@ j@@ ec@@ table meth@@ ad@@ one and oral meth@@ ad@@ one .
technical information on the sub@@ stance is available on the E@@ M@@ EA website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / human@@ doc@@ s / hum@@ ans / E@@ PA@@ R / su@@ box@@ one / su@@ box@@ on@@ e@@ .h@@ t@@ m ) .
sub@@ stitution treatment , generally integrated with psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial care , is typically provided at specialised out@@ patient centres and in shared @@@ -@@ @ care arrangements with office @@@ -@@ @ based general practi@@ tion@@ ers . the available data
treatment effectiveness , quality and standards
however , a report issued by the European Commission ( 200@@ 7@@ a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of interven@@ ing in this setting .
re@@ views of r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials and ob@@ serv@@ ational studies conclude that meth@@ ad@@ one maintenance treatment ( M@@ M@@ T ) and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance treatment ( BM@@ T ) can both be effective for the management of op@@ i@@ oid dependence .
more positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
by the end of 2006 , the inci@@ dence of diagnos@@ ed HIV infection among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users ( I@@ D@@ U@@ s ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
data on newly diagnos@@ ed cases related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 02 , which was due to out@@ breaks in Estonia , countries , HIV pre@@ val@@ ence remained unchanged during the period .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnos@@ ed inf@@ ections related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use with trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among I@@ D@@ U@@ s suggests that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
however , vig@@ il@@ ance is needed as some M@@ ember States continue to show high rates of new HIV inf@@ ections linked to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use , and the situation is even more wor@@ rying in some neighbouring countries .
H@@ C@@ V anti@@ body levels among national samples of I@@ D@@ U@@ s in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 v@@ ary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in exc@@ ess of 40 % .
while estimates generated from non @@@ -@@ @ prob@@ ability samples must always be taken with caution , the vari@@ ations in pre@@ val@@ ence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes .
the pro@@ portion of I@@ D@@ U@@ s among all noti@@ fied cases of hep@@ ati@@ tis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vacc@@ ination programmes targeted at I@@ D@@ U@@ s .
access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade .
prisons are important sett@@ ings for interven@@ tions targeting inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA defin@@ ition of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths ( 13@@ 6 ) ref@@ ers to those deaths that are directly caused ( po@@ is@@ on@@ ings or over@@ dos@@ es ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substan@@ ces present is an illi@@ cit
moreover , many dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths are , in fact , pol@@ y@@ drug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
the second component is broader and covers deaths which can@@ not be directly attri@@ but@@ able to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @@@ -@@ @ term consequences of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , inter@@ actions with mental health issues ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . road traffic accidents ) .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circum@@ stan@@ tial reasons ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . violence related to the drug trade ) .
there is still limited research on the mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and other consequences of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal over@@ dos@@ es and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .
however , other approaches are being explo@@ red where@@ by data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attri@@ but@@ able to drugs in a community ( see " Over@@ all dru@@ g@@ related mortality , " P . 86 ) .
improvements in the quality and reli@@ ability of European data in recent years have allowed better descri@@ p@@ tions of overall and national trends , and most countries have now adopted a case defin@@ ition in line with that of the
most of these deaths are attri@@ but@@ able to the misuse of meth@@ ad@@ one di@@ ver@@ ted from hospitals , pharmac@@ ies , practi@@ tion@@ ers and p@@ ain management physi@@ cians , while only a limited number of them are attributed to meth@@ ad@@ one obtained from sub@@ stitution programmes ( 14@@ 6 ) .
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related .
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
co@@ h@@ ort studies area valuable tool for esti@@ m@@ ating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an over@@ view at national level .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extra@@ po@@ lated from co@@ h@@ ort studies to local ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( C@@ ru@@ ts et al . , 2008 ) .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clin@@ ical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . consequences of other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and esti@@ mation in this area ( see prec@@ eding section ) .

new substan@@ ces under control example on the working methods of online shops ; the way that they respond to users " demands , and new trends among young people .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA conducted a sn@@ ap@@ shot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .

furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitu@@ tes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's future activities .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confron@@ ted .
• the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou Group of the Council of Europe , the United N@@ ations Office on Dru@@ gs and Crime , the WHO Regional Office for Europe , Interpol , the World Customs Organisation , the ES@@ PA@@ D project and the Swedish Council for Information on Al@@ co@@ hol and other Dru@@ gs ( C@@ AN ) ;
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
a les@@ son that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practi@@ tion@@ ers can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
the use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dis@@ su@@ asion of drug abuse . "
in addition , developments in ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addi@@ ction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
commen@@ tary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @@@ -@@ @ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young mal@@ es . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
the estimates presented here rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
problem op@@ i@@ oid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
a c@@ av@@ eat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the ep@@ i@@ demic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems ar@@ ising from the use of this drug are considerable .
any indic@@ ations that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that sub@@ stance use problems are best addressed hol@@ isti@@ cally and in the context of healthy lif@@ est@@ y@@ les and informed cho@@ ices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional perspective is becoming increasingly un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful in understanding the developing nature of pat@@ ter@@ ns of sub@@ stance use in Europe .
in Europe today , pol@@ y@@ drug pat@@ ter@@ ns are the nor@@ m , and the combined use of different substan@@ ces is responsible for , or complic@@ ates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly dev@@ alu@@ ed if they simply open the door for the use of a sub@@ stitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substan@@ ces that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the avail@@ ability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreas@@ es , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and pro@@ portion of treatment demands related to op@@ i@@ oid drugs .
data on dru@@ g@@ related deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreas@@ ing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be di@@ ff@@ using into new populations .
the illi@@ cit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adap@@ t quickly to control measures .
again , market factors and prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als appear important here , with meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine production sites appe@@ aring now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilit@@ ates the import of prec@@ ur@@ sors , in this case 1 @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ en@@ y@@ l @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ pro@@ pan@@ one ( BM@@ K ) , from outside of the European Union .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible ou@@ tw@@ ard di@@ ff@@ usion of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use beyond the Czech Republic .
in this country , meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine problems are long established , but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption .
changes in the ec@@ st@@ asy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als , and these efforts may also have important
this year , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harm@@ reduction interven@@ tions , the web @@@ -@@ @ based approaches have considerable potential .
added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicin@@ es are those about the appearance of a range of sup@@ pos@@ edly " legal " alternatives to controlled psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @@@ -@@ @ based products , in particular her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures , as well as mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise containing syn@@ thetic compo@@ unds .
new substan@@ ces appe@@ aring on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experim@@ ental chem@@ ic@@ als syn@@ th@@ es@@ ised in laborat@@ ories and un@@ tested in hum@@ ans .
foren@@ sic analysis , however , has largely failed to detec@@ t the plant @@@ -@@ @ based substan@@ ces declared on the la@@ bel@@ s , but did identify in some samples syn@@ thetic can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ ids that had been added to the mi@@ x@@ tures .
other topics addressed are the recent adoption and evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans , new data and trends on dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture and developments regarding dru@@ g@@ related research in Europe .
the enforcement of drug prohibi@@ tion is jud@@ ged by the study to have caused substantial un@@ intended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . geographical dis@@ placement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identi@@ fies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Co@@ ordination , co@@ operation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international co@@ operation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which re@@ views current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN M@@ ember States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial co@@ operation between M@@ ember States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
the evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives at@@ tained , progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that ech@@ o those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing conver@@ gence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better ref@@ le@@ ction of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursu@@ ed in external agreements and programmes .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evalu@@ ator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of ref@@ le@@ ction in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dis@@ su@@ ade young people from beginning to use drugs by re@@ affir@@ ming the prohibi@@ tion of drug use and in@@ forming young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Dru@@ gs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 200@@ 8@@ a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of fin@@ alising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 programme with a 1 @@@ -@@ @ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU M@@ ember States .
most countries could provide data on central government expendi@@ ture , and seven also reported expendi@@ ture by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
in some cases , the final report is a sum@@ m@@ ary of annual implementation re@@ views ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
esti@@ m@@ ating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illi@@ cit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
in contrast , for those countries providing C@@ O@@ FO@@ G data for un@@ la@@ bel@@ led
during this period , about a quarter of the tex@@ ts authorised or regulated the use of substan@@ ces such as meth@@ ad@@ one and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine .
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exemp@@ ts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of sy@@ r@@ inges dis@@ pen@@ sed .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new off@@ ence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EU@@ R 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe research efforts in those priority areas that are under@@ represented , in particular drug supply .
analysis of drugs research in the European Union published by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA in 2008 ( 10 ) .
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports .
the United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @@@ -@@ @ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evalu@@ ating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combin@@ es training in life @@@ -@@ @ skills with norm@@ ative education and knowledge acquisition on substan@@ ces .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bul@@ lying , past @@@ -@@ @ week and past @@@ -@@ @ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drin@@ ks on one occasion and having tried can@@ na@@ bis .
new information on selec@@ tive prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
both selec@@ tive and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ c ) .
selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ es with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scar@@ ce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavi@@ our@@ al or psychological problems that may be predic@@ tive for developing problem sub@@ stance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interven@@ tions .
similarly , the " Ko@@ met f@@ ör f@@ ör@@ ä@@ ld@@ rar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing ex@@ ter@@ n@@ alising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive pe@@ er relations .
P@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial interven@@ tions form the foundation of commun@@ it@@ y@@ based out@@ patient and in@@ patient treatment , and they also norm@@ ally comple@@ ment op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment . drug de@@ to@@ x@@ ification is a

in Turkey , sub@@ stitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is per@@ mitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . in 16 countries , specialised public out@@ patient services are the main providers of sub@@ stitution treatment .
see T@@ ables HS@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 1 and HS@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 2 in the 2009 statistical bul@@ let@@ in@@ .@@ Se@@ e T@@ able HS@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 3 in the 2009 statistical bul@@ letin .
the mean age of drug users entering in@@ patient treatment is 30 years , but op@@ i@@ oid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 28 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 26 ) .
the rati@@ o is lower among primary users of non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.@@ 1 : 1 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 8 : 1 ) .
national experts estimate that in@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
single or ir@@ regular treatment outcome evalu@@ ations are also reported by some countries .
e@@ ffic@@ acy is ide@@ ally determined by carrying out controlled trials or r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials where interven@@ tions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
the new mo@@ dul@@ e also includes : links to other information sources , evalu@@ ated interven@@ tions , a g@@ los@@ s@@ ary and a brief syn@@ op@@ sis of the g@@ aps in the current evidence base .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases testing and coun@@ selling , vacc@@ ination and treatment of vir@@ al hep@@ ati@@ tis .
the focus of harm reduction responses has expanded beyond the HIV / AIDS ep@@ i@@ demic into the broader perspective of cat@@ ering for the health and social needs of problem drug users , especially those who are socially excluded .
all M@@ ember States report the avail@@ ability of housing sch@@ e@@ mes that can accommodate drug users .
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their ten@@ ancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consen@@ su@@ al crime , " where con@@ sent@@ ing individuals secre@@ tly participate in an un@@ law@@ ful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . during a fo@@ ot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh study , which found that recover@@ ing drug users who received employment @@@ -@@ @ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( Mc@@ In@@ tos@@ h et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at dis@@ rup@@ ting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and sear@@ ches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more gener@@ ic tac@@ tic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing impor@@ tation and expor@@ tation requests as well as identi@@ fying and investigating suspicious transactions .

education about over@@ d@@ ose risk is reported by all countries , and in nine of them it exists in most relevant cities with a significant number of problem drug users .
drug users are informed about over@@ d@@ ose risks , including decreased tolerance after periods of abst@@ in@@ ence , the effects and risks of pol@@ y@@ drug use , in particular con@@ com@@ it@@ ant alcohol use , risks of using drugs when alone and skills in first aid .
in England , it has been estimated that 15 % of the 1 5@@ 06 drug over@@ d@@ ose deaths in 2005 occurred in people recently released from prison ( Department of Health , 2007 ) .
during the first 3 months , all 12 over@@ dos@@ es where n@@ alo@@ x@@ one was used had been rever@@ sed successfully , while one death had occurred in the six over@@ dos@@ es in which it was not used .
according to expert ratings from 24 countries , prison pre @@@ -@@ @ release coun@@ selling on over@@ d@@ ose risk and prevention is currently not provided in six European countries , only provided to a few problem drug users in prison in 10 countries , and to less than half of them in a further six countries .

in practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some sub@@ groups of the population of drug @@@ -@@ @ using offen@@ ders or to some types of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
it is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may v@@ ary even in the same person over time .
the use of op@@ i@@ ates and can@@ na@@ bis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psych@@ op@@ harmac@@ olog@@ ically indu@@ ced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tran@@ qu@@ il@@ lis@@ ers ) tend to reduce violent imp@@ ul@@ ses and aggres@@ sion .

the resulting concep@@ tual model , composed of four categories of drug crimes , is the basis for the defin@@ ition of the term " dru@@ g@@ related crime " used here , the individual components of which are discussed below .
Studies of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime have often over@@ looked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by defin@@ ition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the pro@@ portion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
it produces e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia and appe@@ ti@@ te sup@@ pression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .

cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
drug addi@@ ction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibi@@ ting a loss of control over their consumption . ad@@ dicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
most ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research on addi@@ ction has focused on the role a drug @@@ -@@ @ released ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter called dop@@ am@@ ine has on the repeated activ@@ ation of the " reward system " - cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry made up of a complex set of cer@@ e@@ br@@ al structures which act as a baro@@ meter , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
sp@@ urred on by recent technological developments oc@@ curr@@ ing rapidly in this field , new@@ models have ar@@ isen which take into account the implic@@ ation of other ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters in the process , also expl@@ oring the role of gen@@ etic differences between individuals .
N@@ euro@@ biological research in addi@@ ction and that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse dis@@ rup@@ ts this regulation .
new technologies mean that ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research can start to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological and gen@@ etic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addi@@ ction if they use drugs .
new technologies in addi@@ ction research non @@@ -@@ @ inv@@ asive techniques which may help to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's in@@ ability to stop using drugs .
this dys@@ regulation would correspon@@ d either to an increased reac@@ tivity of dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons to specific sti@@ mul@@ i linked to the pleas@@ ur@@ able and ad@@ dic@@ tive product or to a down @@@ -@@ @ regulation of dop@@ am@@ ine sign@@ al@@ ling and a dam@@ pen@@ ing of activity in the reward path@@ way .
animal studies indicate that nor@@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gic and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ er@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons are coup@@ led ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . limit the activity of each other )
progress in ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research on addi@@ ction has led to the use of drugs which target the dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in
a number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being resear@@ ched which may provide new approaches to tre@@ ating some forms of drug dependence .

this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Co@@ p 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es .
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to K@@ yo@@ to on time ) . ' K@@ yo@@ to ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing

next December , a major task of the Co@@ p 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .

in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the E@@ EA is also preparing an analysis of the C@@ AP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsi@@ dy 's ' environmental ' spending .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , far@@ ming causes almost half of the nit@@ ro@@ gen pollution in rivers , 94 % of am@@ mon@@ ia emissions and 9 % of total green@@ house gas emissions .
the Com@@ mon Agriculture Policy ( C@@ AP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @@@ -@@ @ war food shortages .
the subsi@@ dy has increasingly been dec@@ ou@@ pled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the E@@ EA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
the single farm payments , under P@@ il@@ lar I , are still very much targeted at far@@ ms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .

the Bal@@ tic was actually a fres@@ h@@ water lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
sal@@ in@@ ity in the Bal@@ tic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Bal@@ tic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Bal@@ tic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Bal@@ tic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integr@@ ating agricultural , fisher@@ ies and regional policies . this plan , adopted in

kno@@ ck @@@ -@@ @ on effects , so @@@ -@@ @ called ' indirect land @@@ -@@ @ use changes ' , would impact elsewhere in the world : as Europe cuts back on food exports , other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap .
in this context , the E@@ EA has been looking at how the im@@ pending bio@@ energy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
the transport sector is also increasing green@@ house gas emissions and e@@ ating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that bi@@ of@@ u@@ els make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certi@@ fied as sustainable .
however , a clear message still emer@@ ges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate m@@ iti@@ gation , to pri@@ or@@ iti@@ se bio@@ energy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the ship@@ ment of haz@@ ard@@ ous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment@@ .@@ Electronic waste , which is considered haz@@ ard@@ ous , is an important case .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Co@@ operation and Development ( OECD ) .@@ The EU 's long term aim is that each M@@ ember State should dis@@ pose of its own waste dome@@ sti@@ cally ( the ' pro@@ xim@@ ity principle ' ) .

the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shi@@ pped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don '@@ t know whether it is bad for the environment .
