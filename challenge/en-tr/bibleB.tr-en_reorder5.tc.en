and the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep . and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters .
and God saw the light , that it was good : and God divided the light from the darkness .
and God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
and God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
and the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and God created great whales , and every living creature that moveth , which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind , and every winged fowl after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God blessed them , saying , Be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
and God blessed them , and God said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
and God said , behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
and God saw every thing that he had made , and , behold , it was very good . and the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
thus the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens ,
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
but there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
and a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
the name of the first is Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
and the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria . and the fourth river is Euphrates .
and the Lord God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
and the Lord God commanded the man , saying , Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him .
and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ;
and the rib , which the Lord God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
and the woman said unto the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden .
and he said , I heard THY voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
and the man said , The woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
and I will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between THY seed and her seed ; it shall bruise THY head , and thou shalt bruise his heel .
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
in the sweat of THY face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
and she again bare his brother Abel . and Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it came to pass , that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord .
and Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering :
but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect . and Cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door . and unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
and Cain talked with Abel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him .
and now art thou Cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive THY brother 's blood from THY hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
behold , thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth ; and from THY face shall I be hid ; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth me shall slay me .
and the Lord said unto him , Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain , vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold . and the Lord set a mark upon Cain , lest any finding him should kill him .
and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of Eden .
and Cain knew his wife ; and she conceived , and bare Enoch : and he builded a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , Enoch .
and unto Enoch was born Irad : and Irad begat Mehujael : and Mehujael begat Methusael : and Methusael begat Lamech .
and Lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
and Adah bare Jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as have cattle .
and his brother 's name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and Zillah , she also bare Tubal @-@ cain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of Tubal @-@ cain was Naamah .
and Lamech said unto his wives , Adah and Zillah , Hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : for I have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
and to Seth , to him also there was born a son ; and he called his name Enos : then began men to call upon the name of the Lord .
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , in the likeness of God made he him ;
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name Seth :
and the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years : and he begat sons and daughters :
and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years : and he died .
and all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years : and he died .
and all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years : and he died .
and all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years : and he died .
and all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years : and he died .
and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years :
and Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years , and begat Lamech :
and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years : and he died .
and Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years , and begat a son :
and he called his name Noah , saying , This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands , because of the ground which the Lord hath Cursed .
and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years : and he died .
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
and the Lord said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that I have made them .
these are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
the earth also was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
and God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make thee an Ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the Ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the Ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
a window shalt thou make to the Ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the Ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
but with thee will I establish my Covenant ; and thou shalt come into the Ark , thou , and THY sons , and THY wife , and THY sons ' wives with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the Ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
thus did Noah ; according to all that God commanded him , so did he .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the Ark , because of the waters of the flood .
and it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
in the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the Ark ;
they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and they went in unto Noah into the Ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the Lord shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the Ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the Ark went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hills , that were under the whole heaven , were covered .
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
and God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the Ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
and the Ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the Ark which he had made :
and he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the Ark ;
and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the dove ; which returned not again unto him any more .
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth : and Noah removed the covering of the Ark , and looked , and , behold , the face of the ground was dry .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and Noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him :
every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the Ark .
and Noah builded an altar unto the Lord ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
but flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and God spake unto Noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
and I will establish my Covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and God said , This is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations :
I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a Covenant between me and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud :
and I will remember my Covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , This is the token of the Covenant , which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of Noah , that went forth of the Ark , were Shem , and ham , and Japheth : and ham is the father of Canaan .
and Noah began to be an husbandman , and he planted a vineyard :
and he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
and Noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his younger son had done unto him .
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
God shall enlarge Japheth , and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
and all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years : and he died .
now these are the generations of the sons of Noah , Shem , ham , and Japheth : and unto them were sons born after the flood .
the sons of Japheth ; Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and Tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
by these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
and the sons of ham ; Cush , and Mizraim , and Phut , and Canaan .
and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
and the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , even unto Lasha .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
and the children of Aram ; Uz , and Hul , and Gether , and Mash .
and unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother 's name was Joktan .
and their dwelling was from Mesha , as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and they said one to another , Go to , let us make brick , and burn them throughly . and they had brick for stone , and slime had they for morter .
and they said , Go to , let us build us a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men builded .
and the Lord said , behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
go to , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
so the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
these are the generations of Shem : Shem was an hundred years old , and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood :
and Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
and Terah took Abram his son , and lot the son of Haran his son 's son , and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram 's wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran , and dwelt there .
and the days of Terah were two hundred and five years : and Terah died in Haran .
now the Lord had said unto Abram , Get thee out of THY country , and from THY kindred , and from THY father 's house , unto a land that I will shew thee :
and I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and make THY name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
and I will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee : and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed .
so Abram departed , as the Lord had spoken unto him ; and lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
and Abram took Sarai his wife , and lot his brother 's son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came .
and Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . and the Canaanite was then in the land .
and the Lord appeared unto Abram , and said , unto THY seed will I give this land : and there builded he an altar unto the Lord , who appeared unto him .
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and Hai on the east : and there he builded an altar unto the Lord , and called upon the name of the Lord .
and there was a famine in the land : and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
say , I pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with me for THY sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it came to pass , that , when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
the princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh : and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
and he entreated Abram well for her sake : and he had sheep , and oxen , and he asses , and menservants , and maidservants , and she asses , and camels .
and Pharaoh called Abram , and said , What is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was THY wife ?
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold THY wife , take her , and go THY way .
and Abram went up out of Egypt , he , and his wife , and all that he had , and lot with him , into the south .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and Hai ;
unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there Abram called on the name of the Lord .
and lot also , which went with Abram , had flocks , and herds , and tents .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdmen of lot 's cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and Abram said unto lot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , and between my herdmen and THY herdmen ; for we be brethren .
is not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , I pray thee , from me : if thou wilt take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then I will go to the left .
then lot chose him all the plain of Jordan ; and lot journeyed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan , and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain , and pitched his tent toward Sodom .
and the Lord said unto Abram , after that lot was separated from him , Lift up now thine eyes , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will I give it , and to THY seed for ever .
and I will make THY seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall THY seed also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for I will give it unto thee .
then Abram removed his tent , and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre , which is in Hebron , and built there an altar unto the Lord .
and it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , and tidal king of nations ;
that these made war with Bera king of Sodom , and with Birsha king of Gomorrah , Shinab king of Admah , and Shemeber king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar .
and they returned , and came to En @-@ mishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon @-@ Tamar .
and the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and fell there ; and they that remained fled to the mountain .
and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and they took lot , Abram 's brother 's son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eschol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and Eighteen , and pursued them unto Dan .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer , and of the kings that were with him , at the valley of Shaveh , which is the king 's Dale .
and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was the priest of the most high God .
and he blessed him , and said , blessed be Abram of the most high God , possessor of heaven and earth :
and blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered thine enemies into THY hand . and he gave him tithes of all .
save only that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men which went with me , Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre ; let them take their portion .
and Abram said , behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall THY seed be .
and he said unto him , I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he said unto him , Take me an heifer of three years old , and a she goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases , Abram drove them away .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that THY seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will I judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
and thou shalt go to THY fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
and it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces .
now Sarai Abram 's wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
and Sarai Abram 's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
and he went in unto Hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
and the angel of the Lord said unto her , Return to THY mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
and the angel of the Lord said unto her , I will multiply THY seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
and the angel of the Lord said unto her , behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the Lord hath heard THY affliction .
and she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her , Thou God seest me : for she said , Have I also here looked after him that seeth me ?
and Hagar bare Abram a son : and Abram called his son 's name , which Hagar bare , Ishmael .
and when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the Lord appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
and I will make my Covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and Abram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying ,
neither shall THY name any more be called Abram , but THY name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
and I will make thee exceeding fruitful , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and THY seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting Covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to THY seed after thee .
and God said unto Abraham , Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore , thou , and THY seed after thee in their generations .
this is my Covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and THY seed after thee ; Every man child among you shall be circumcised .
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you .
he that is born in THY house , and he that is bought with THY money , must needs be circumcised : and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting Covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken my Covenant .
and I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and God said , Sarah THY wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my Covenant with him for an everlasting Covenant , and with his seed after him .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he left off talking with him , and God went up from Abraham .
and Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham 's house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground ,
and said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in THY sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from THY servant :
let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he hasted to dress it .
and he took butter , and milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat .
now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
is any thing too hard for the Lord ? at the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son .
and the men rose up from thence , and looked toward Sodom : and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
and the men turned their faces from thence , and went toward Sodom : but Abraham stood yet before the Lord .
and he said unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Peradventure there shall thirty be found there . and he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
and the Lord went his way , as soon as he had left communing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
and there came two angels to Sodom at even ; and lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bake unleavened bread , and they did eat .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they called unto lot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
and lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him ,
but the men put forth their hand , and pulled lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord ; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it .
and while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the Lord being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
behold now , THY servant hath found grace in THY sight , and thou hast magnified THY mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life ; and I cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and I die :
behold now , this city is near to flee unto , and it is a little one : Oh , let me escape thither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into Zoar .
then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven ;
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
and Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord :
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt .
and lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
and the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and the firstborn bare a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Benammi : the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
and Abraham said , Because I thought , surely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will slay me for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and it came to pass , when God caused me to wander from my father 's house , that I said unto her , This is THY kindness which thou shalt shew unto me ; at every place whither we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
and Abimelech took sheep , and oxen , and menservants , and womenservants , and gave them unto Abraham , and restored him Sarah his wife .
so Abraham prayed unto God : and God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his maidservants ; and they bare children .
and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said , and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken .
for Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .
and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
and she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children suck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
Wherefore she said unto Abraham , cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
and God said unto Abraham , Let it not be grievous in THY sight because of the lad , and because of THY bondwoman ; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in Isaac shall THY seed be called .
and the water was spent in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
and God heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven , and said unto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ? fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thine hand ; for I will make him a great nation .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
and God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest :
and Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water , which Abimelech 's servants had violently taken away .
and Abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto Abimelech ; and both of them made a Covenant .
and he said , For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that I have digged this well .
thus they made a Covenant at Beer @-@ sheba : then Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
and it came to pass after these things , that God did tempt Abraham , and said unto him , Abraham : and he said , behold , here I am .
and he said , Take now THY son , thine only son Isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
and Abraham said unto his young men , abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you ,
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
and he said , lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld THY son , thine only son from me .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah @-@ jireh : as it is said to this day , In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen .
and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time ,
and said , By myself have I sworn , saith the Lord , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld THY son , thine only son :
that in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply THY seed as the stars of the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and THY seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
and in THY seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
so Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer @-@ sheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beer @-@ sheba .
and it came to pass after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , behold , Milcah , she hath also born children unto THY brother Nahor ;
and Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old : these were the years of the life of Sarah .
and Sarah died in Kirjath @-@ arba ; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan : and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her .
and Abraham stood up from before his dead , and spake unto the sons of Heth , saying ,
and Abraham stood up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth : and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Nay , my lord , hear me : the field give I thee , and the cave that is therein , I give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury THY dead .
and Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land .
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth .
and Abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things .
and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , THY hand under my thigh :
and I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
and the servant said unto him , Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land : must I needs bring THY son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter .
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
behold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
and the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
and the servant ran to meet her , and said , Let me , I pray thee , drink a little water of THY pitcher .
and she said , Drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
and the man wondering at her held his peace , to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and she said unto him , I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , which she bare unto Nahor .
and the man bowed down his head , and worshipped the Lord .
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth : I being in the way , the Lord led me to the house of my master 's brethren .
and the damsel ran , and told them of her mother 's house these things .
and Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
and the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and the Lord hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
and Sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
and he said unto me , The Lord , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper THY way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father 's house :
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
and I came this day unto the well , and said , O Lord God of my master Abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which I go ;
behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and I say to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water of THY pitcher to drink ;
and she say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for THY camels : let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master 's son .
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give THY camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
and I asked her , and said , whose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bare unto him : and I put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
and I bowed down my head , and worshipped the Lord , and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto his son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be THY master 's son 's wife , as the Lord hath spoken .
and it came to pass , that , when Abraham 's servant heard their words , he worshipped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tarried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , Send me away unto my master .
and her brother and her mother said , Let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and they sent away Rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and Abraham 's servant , and his men .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let THY seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and Rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man : and the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
and Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai @-@ roi ; for he dwelt in the south country .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
and Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she lighted off the Camel .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a vail , and covered herself .
and the servant told Isaac all things that he had done .
and Jokshan begat Sheba , and Dedan . and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim .
and the sons of Midian ; Ephah , and Epher , and Hanoch , and Abida , and Eldaah . all these were the children of Keturah .
but unto the sons of the concubines , which Abraham had , Abraham gave gifts , and sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , unto the east country .
and these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived , an hundred threescore and fifteen years .
then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ;
the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth : there was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
and it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai @-@ roi .
now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's handmaid , bare unto Abraham :
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their castles ; twelve princes according to their nations .
and these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
and they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur , that is before Egypt , as thou goest toward Assyria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan @-@ aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
and Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife , because she was barren : and the Lord was intreated of him , and Rebekah his wife conceived .
and the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? and she went to inquire of the Lord .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Esau 's heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .
and the boys grew : and Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Esau despised his birthright .
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar .
and the Lord appeared unto him , and said , Go not down into Egypt ; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of :
Sojourn in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto THY seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham THY father ;
and I will make THY seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and will give unto THY seed all these countries ; and in THY seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
and Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have lien with THY wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us .
and the man waxed great , and went forward , and grew until he became very great :
for he had possession of flocks , and possessions of herds , and great store of servants : and the Philistines envied him .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and Isaac departed thence , and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar , and dwelt there .
and Isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father ; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
and Isaac 's servants digged in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
and the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac 's herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him .
and he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there : and there Isaac 's servants digged a well .
then Abimelech went to him from Gerar , and Ahuzzath one of his friends , and Phichol the chief captain of his army .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite :
and it came to pass , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his eldest son , and said unto him , My son : and he said unto him , behold , here am I.
now therefore take , I pray thee , THY weapons , THY quiver and THY bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
and make me savoury meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
and Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son . and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son , saying , behold , I heard THY father speak unto Esau THY brother , saying ,
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for THY father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to THY father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
and Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man :
my father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
and he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savoury meat , such as his father loved .
and Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jacob her younger son :
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the Lord THY God brought it to me .
and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
and he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau 's hands : so he blessed him .
and he said , Art thou my very son Esau ? and he said , I am .
and he said , Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's venison , that my soul may bless thee . and he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he drank .
and his father Isaac said unto him , Come near now , and kiss me , my son .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed :
therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
let people serve thee , and nations bow down to thee : be lord over THY brethren , and let THY mother 's sons bow down to thee : Cursed be every one that curseth thee , and blessed be he that blesseth thee .
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
and he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that THY soul may bless me .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , bless me , even me also , O my father .
and he said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away THY blessing .
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , behold , THY dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by THY sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve THY brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off THY neck .
and these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , behold , THY brother Esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran ;
and Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
arise , go to Padan @-@ aram , to the house of Bethuel THY mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban THY mother 's brother .
and God Almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
and give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to THY seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
and Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Padan @-@ aram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother .
and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father ;
then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
and he lighted upon a certain place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
and , behold , the Lord stood above it , and said , I am the Lord God of Abraham THY father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to THY seed ;
and THY seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in THY seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
and , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
and Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , surely the Lord is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Bethel : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
and Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
so that I come again to my father 's house in peace ; then shall the Lord be my God :
and this stone , which I have set for a pillar , shall be God 's house : and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee .
then Jacob went on his journey , and came into the land of the people of the east .
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks : and a great stone was upon the well 's mouth .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and he said , Lo , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed them .
and they said , We cannot , until all the flocks be gathered together , and till they roll the stone from the well 's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and while he yet spake with them , Rachel came with her father 's sheep : for she kept them .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother 's brother .
and Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
and Jacob told Rachel that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Rebekah 's son : and she ran and told her father .
and it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Laban all these things .
and Laban said , It is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
and Jacob served seven years for Rachel ; and they seemed unto him but a few days , for the love he had to her .
and Jacob said unto Laban , Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in unto her .
and Laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid .
and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid .
and he went in also unto Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
and when the Lord saw that Leah was hated , he opened her womb : but Rachel was barren .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
and when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children , Rachel envied her sister ; and said unto Jacob , Give me children , or else I die .
and Jacob 's anger was kindled against Rachel : and he said , Am I in God 's stead , who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb ?
and Rachel said , With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister , and I have prevailed : and she called his name Naphtali .
when Leah saw that she had left bearing , she took Zilpah her maid , and gave her Jacob to wife .
and Leah said , God hath given me my hire , because I have given my maiden to my husband : and she called his name Issachar .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and said , God hath taken away my reproach :
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children , for whom I have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service which I have done thee .
and Laban said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes , tarry : for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for THY sake .
and he said , appoint me THY wages , and I will give it .
for it was little which thou hadst before I came , and it is now increased unto a multitude ; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming : and now when shall I provide for mine own house also ?
I will pass through all THY flock to day , removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats : and of such shall be my hire .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and he set three days ' journey betwixt himself and Jacob : and Jacob fed the rest of Laban 's flocks .
and Jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chesnut tree ; and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth cattle ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
and Jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto Laban 's cattle .
and it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
but when the cattle were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were Laban 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
and Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
and said unto them , I see your father 's countenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father hath been with me .
and ye know that with all my power I have served your father .
if he said thus , The speckled shall be THY wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he said thus , The ringstraked shall be THY hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstraked .
thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me .
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , behold , the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked , speckled , and grisled .
and he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee .
I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of THY kindred .
for all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do .
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels ;
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Padan @-@ aram , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
and Laban went to shear his sheep : and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father 's .
and Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey ; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead .
then Laban overtook Jacob . now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount : and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead .
and Laban said to Jacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away unawares to me , and carried away my daughters , as captives taken with the sword ?
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me ; and didst not tell me , that I might have sent thee away with mirth , and with songs , with tabret , and with harp ?
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after THY father 's house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
and Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force THY daughters from me .
with whomsoever thou findest THY gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee . for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
and Laban went into Jacob 's tent , and into Leah 's tent , and into the two maidservants ' tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the Camel 's furniture , and sat upon them . and Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
and she said to her father , Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee ; for the custom of women is upon me . and he searched , but found not the images .
and Jacob was wroth , and chode with Laban : and Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my trespass ? what is my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all THY household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and THY brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
this twenty years have I been with thee ; THY ewes and THY she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of THY flock have I not eaten .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the Frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
thus have I been twenty years in THY house ; I served thee fourteen years for THY two daughters , and six years for THY cattle : and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
now therefore come thou , let us make a Covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
and Laban called it Jegar @-@ sahadutha : but Jacob called it Galeed .
if thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness betwixt me and thee .
and Laban said to Jacob , behold this heap , and behold this pillar , which I have cast betwixt me and thee ;
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that I will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me , for harm .
the God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge betwixt us . and Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
and early in the morning Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and Laban departed , and returned unto his place .
and Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
and when Jacob saw them , he said , This is God 's host : and he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
and Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir , the country of Edom .
and he commanded them , saying , Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau ; Thy servant Jacob saith thus , I have sojourned with Laban , and stayed there until now :
and I have oxen , and asses , flocks , and menservants , and womenservants : and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in THY sight .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
and said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
and Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the Lord which saidst unto me , Return unto THY country , and to THY kindred , and I will deal well with thee :
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto THY servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and thou saidst , I will surely do thee good , and make THY seed as the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbered for multitude .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
and he commanded the foremost , saying , When Esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose are these before thee ?
then thou shalt say , They be THY servant Jacob 's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
and say ye moreover , behold , THY servant Jacob is behind us . for he said , I will appease him with the present that goeth before me , and afterward I will see his face ; peradventure he will accept of me .
so went the present over before him : and himself lodged that night in the company .
and he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two womenservants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the Ford Jabbok .
and he took them , and sent them over the Brook , and sent over that he had .
and Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
and Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , THY name . and he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and Jacob called the name of the place Peniel : for I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved .
and as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him , and he halted upon his thigh .
therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank , which is upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touched the hollow of Jacob 's thigh in the sinew that shrank .
and Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children unto Leah , and unto Rachel , and unto the two handmaids .
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph hindermost .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , Who are those with thee ? and he said , The children which God hath graciously given THY servant .
then the handmaidens came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
and Leah also with her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came Joseph near and Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . and he urged him , and he took it .
and he said unto him , My lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me : and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
and Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built him an house , and made booths for his cattle : therefore the name of the place is called Succoth .
and Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan @-@ aram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
and he bought a parcel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for an hundred pieces of money .
and Dinah the daughter of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
and Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter : now his sons were with his cattle in the field : and Jacob held his peace until they were come .
and Hamor communed with them , saying , The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter : I pray you give her him to wife .
and make ye marriages with us , and give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
and ye shall dwell with us : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein .
and Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , Let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me I will give .
and the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully , and said , because he had defiled Dinah their sister :
and they said unto them , We cannot do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us :
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcised ;
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circumcised , as they are circumcised .
and unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house , and went out .
the sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
they took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and spoiled even all that was in the house .
and God said unto Jacob , arise , go up to Bethel , and dwell there : and make there an altar unto God , that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau THY brother .
then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
and they journeyed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob .
so Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an altar , and called the place El @-@ Beth @-@ el : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
but Deborah Rebekah 's nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called Allon @-@ bachuth .
and God appeared unto Jacob again , when he came out of Padan @-@ aram , and blessed him .
and God said unto him , Thy name is Jacob : THY name shall not be called any more Jacob , but Israel shall be THY name : and he called his name Israel .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of THY loins ;
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to THY seed after thee will I give the land .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him , Bethel .
and they journeyed from Bethel ; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath : and Rachel travailed , and she had hard labour .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the midwife said unto her , Fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and it came to pass , as her soul was in departing , ( for she died ) that she called his name Ben @-@ oni : but his father called him Benjamin .
and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel 's grave unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father 's concubine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
and the sons of Bilhah , Rachel 's handmaid ; Dan , and Naphtali :
and the sons of Zilpah , Leah 's handmaid ; Gad , and Asher : these are the sons of Jacob , which were born to him in Padan @-@ aram .
and the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years .
and Isaac gave up the ghost , and died , and was gathered unto his people , being old and full of days : and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
now these are the generations of Esau , who is Edom .
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
and Aholibamah bare Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah : these are the sons of Esau , which were born unto him in the land of Canaan .
and Esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of Canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob .
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
and these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir :
these are the names of Esau 's sons ; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau .
and these were the sons of Aholibamah , the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon , Esau 's wife : and she bare to Esau Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah .
these were dukes of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau ; Duke Teman , Duke Omar , Duke Zepho , Duke Kenaz ,
Duke Korah , Duke Gatam , and Duke Amalek : these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these were the sons of Adah .
and these are the sons of Reuel Esau 's son ; Duke Nahath , Duke Zerah , Duke Shammah , Duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau 's wife .
and these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau 's wife ; Duke Jeush , Duke Jaalam , Duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau 's wife .
these are the sons of Esau , who is Edom , and these are their dukes .
these are the sons of Seir the Horite , who inhabited the land ; Lotan , and Shobal , and Zibeon , and Anah ,
and Dishon , and Ezer , and Dishan : these are the dukes of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
and the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam ; and Lotan 's sister was Timna .
and the children of Shobal were these ; Alvan , and Manahath , and Ebal , Shepho , and Onam .
and these are the children of Zibeon ; both Ajah , and Anah : this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father .
and the children of Anah were these ; Dishon , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah .
and these are the children of Dishon ; Hemdan , and Eshban , and Ithran , and Cheran .
these are the dukes that came of the Horites ; Duke Lotan , Duke Shobal , Duke Zibeon , Duke Anah ,
Duke Dishon , Duke Ezer , Duke Dishan : these are the dukes that came of Hori , among their dukes in the land of Seir .
and these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel .
and Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom : and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
and Bela died , and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead .
and Jobab died , and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead .
and Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and Samlah died , and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
and Baal @-@ hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pau ; and his wife 's name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; Duke Timnah , Duke Alvah , Duke Jetheth ,
Duke Magdiel , Duke Iram : these be the dukes of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession : he is Esau the father of the Edomites .
and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren , they hated him , and could not speak peaceably unto him .
and Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
and he said unto them , Hear , I pray you , this dream which I have dreamed :
for , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
and his brethren said to him , Shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
and when they saw him afar off , even before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
and Reuben said unto them , shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
come , and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . and his brethren were content .
then there passed by Midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Reuben returned unto the pit ; and , behold , Joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
and they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be THY son 's coat or no .
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . thus his father wept for him .
and it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a son ; and called his name Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bare him .
and ER , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord slew him .
and Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah 's wife died ; and Judah was comforted , and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
and it was told Tamar , saying , behold THY father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep .
when Judah saw her , he thought her to be an harlot ; because she had covered her face .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive his pledge from the woman 's hand : but he found her not .
and it came to pass in the time of her travail , that , behold , twins were in her womb .
and it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first ,
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called Zarah .
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
and the Lord was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and his master saw that the Lord was with him , and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
and Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
and he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . and Joseph was a goodly person , and well favoured .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Lie with me .
and it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and she caught him by his garment , saying , Lie with me : and he left his garment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she spake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did THY servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
but the Lord was with Joseph , and shewed him mercy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the Lord was with him , and that which he did , the Lord made it to prosper .
and it came to pass after these things , that the Butler of the king of Egypt and his Baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
and Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers , against the chief of the butlers , and against the chief of the Bakers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
and they dreamed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the Butler and the Baker of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and he asked Pharaoh 's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord 's house , saying , Wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
and they said unto him , We have dreamed a dream , and there is no interpreter of it . and Joseph said unto them , Do not interpretations belong to God ? tell me them , I pray you .
and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes :
and Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto THY place : and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his Butler .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
when the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto Joseph , I also was in my dream , and , behold , I had three white baskets on my head :
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up THY head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat THY flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass the third day , which was Pharaoh 's birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Baker among his servants .
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that Pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed ; and they fed in a Meadow .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine . so Pharaoh awoke .
and he slept and dreamed the second time : and , behold , seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them .
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . and Pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard 's house , both me and the chief Baker :
and we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and there was there with us a young man , an Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpret .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in unto Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and I have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , In my dream , behold , I stood upon the bank of the river :
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favoured ; and they fed in a Meadow :
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness :
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine :
and when they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
and I saw in my dream , and , behold , seven ears came up in one stalk , full and good :
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears : and I told this unto the magicians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine .
this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : what God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt :
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
and Pharaoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
Thou shalt be over my house , and according unto THY word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , See , I have set thee over all the land of Egypt .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had ; and they cried before him , bow the knee : and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt .
and Pharaoh called Joseph 's name Zaphnath @-@ paaneah ; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On . and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he left numbering ; for it was without number .
and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh : for God , said he , hath made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
and the name of the second called he Ephraim : for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven years of plenteousness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread : and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians , Go unto Joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ?
and he said , behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
but Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , Jacob sent not with his brethren ; for he said , Lest peradventure mischief befall him .
and the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came : for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
and Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Joseph 's brethren came , and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth .
and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them , and said unto them , Ye are spies ; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
Hereby ye shall be proved : by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hither .
if ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of your houses :
and Reuben answered them , saying , Spake I not unto you , saying , Do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required .
and they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter .
and he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and they laded their asses with the corn , and departed thence .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the Inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell unto them ; saying ,
the man , who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
we be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan .
and the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , Hereby shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone :
and bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall I know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and Jacob their father said unto them , Me have ye bereaved of my children : Joseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye will take Benjamin away : all these things are against me .
and Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
if thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food :
but if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and Judah said unto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
I will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if I bring him not unto thee , and set him before thee , then let me bear the blame for ever :
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ruler of his house , Bring these men home , and slay , and make ready ; for these men shall dine with me at noon .
and the man did as Joseph bade ; and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house .
and they came near to the steward of Joseph 's house , and they communed with him at the door of the house ,
and it came to pass , when we came to the Inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food : we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks .
and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
and they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there .
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves to him to the earth .
and Joseph made haste ; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother : and he sought where to weep ; and he entered into his chamber , and wept there .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews ; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
and they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men marvelled one at another .
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but Benjamin 's mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were merry with him .
and he commanded the steward of his house , saying , fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack 's mouth of the youngest , and his corn money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
and he overtook them , and he spake unto them these same words .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of THY lord 's house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of THY servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bondmen .
and he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the youngest : and the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
and Judah and his brethren came to Joseph 's house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Judah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let THY servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not thine anger burn against THY servant : for thou art even as Pharaoh .
and we said unto my lord , The lad cannot leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
and it came to pass when we came up unto THY servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
and we said , We cannot go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down : for we may not see the man 's face , except our youngest brother be with us .
and the one went out from me , and I said , surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
and if ye take this also from me , and mischief befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
for THY servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , If I bring him not unto thee , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
now therefore , I pray thee , let THY servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
for how shall I go up to my father , and the lad be not with me ? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , I am Joseph ; doth my father yet live ? and his brethren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith THY son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and THY children , and THY children 's children , and THY flocks , and THY herds , and all that thou hast :
and there will I nourish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and THY household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and he fell upon his brother Benjamin 's neck , and wept ; and Benjamin wept upon his neck .
moreover he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
and the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , Joseph 's brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto THY brethren , This do ye ; lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
and they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father ,
and told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . and Jacob 's heart fainted , for he believed them not .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
and Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beer @-@ sheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac .
and he said , I am God , the God of THY father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
I will go down with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
and Jacob rose up from Beer @-@ sheba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
and they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
and these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob 's firstborn .
and the sons of Reuben ; Hanoch , and Phallu , and Hezron , and Carmi .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
and the sons of Judah ; ER , and Onan , and Shelah , and Pharez , and Zerah : but ER and Onan died in the land of Canaan . and the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul .
these be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padan @-@ aram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
and the sons of Gad ; Ziphion , and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , Eri , and Arodi , and Areli .
and the sons of Asher ; Jimnah , and Ishuah , and Isui , and Beriah , and Serah their sister : and the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
and unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , which Asenath the daughter of Poti @-@ pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and the sons of Benjamin were Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera , and Naaman , Ehi , and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard .
these are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
and the sons of Naphtali ; Jahzeel , and Guni , and Jezer , and Shillem .
these are the sons of Bilhah , which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt , which came out of his loins , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were threescore and six ;
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
and he sent Judah before him unto Joseph , to direct his face unto Goshen ; and they came into the land of Goshen .
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;
and the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
and it shall come to pass , when Pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , What is your occupation ?
that ye shall say , Thy servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
and he took some of his brethren , even five men , and presented them unto Pharaoh .
they said moreover unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for THY servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let THY servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
and Joseph brought in Jacob his father , and set him before Pharaoh : and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and Joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
and when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came unto Joseph , and said , Give us bread : for why should we die in THY presence ? for the money faileth .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became Pharaoh 's .
and as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof .
then Joseph said unto the people , behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
and they said , Thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh 's .
and Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the country of Goshen ; and they had possessions therein , and grew , and multiplied exceedingly .
and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years : so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , behold , THY father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
and one told Jacob , and said , behold , THY son Joseph cometh unto thee : and Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and said unto me , behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to THY seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and now THY two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and THY issue , which thou begettest after them , shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath ; the same is Bethlehem .
and Joseph said unto his father , They are my sons , whom God hath given me in this place . and he said , Bring them , I pray thee , unto me , and I will bless them .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
and Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon Ephraim 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh 's head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn .
and he blessed Joseph , and said , God , before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk , the God which fed me all my life long unto this day ,
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , it displeased him : and he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from Ephraim 's head unto Manasseh 's head .
moreover I have given to thee one portion above THY brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
gather yourselves together , and hear , ye sons of Jacob ; and hearken unto Israel your father .
Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
unstable as water , thou shalt not excel ; because thou wentest up to THY father 's bed ; then defiledst thou it : he went up to my couch .
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
Cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
Judah , thou art he whom THY brethren shall praise : THY hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies ; THY father 's children shall bow down before thee .
Judah is a lion 's whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art gone up : he stooped down , he couched as a lion , and as an old lion ; who shall rouse him up ?
the sceptre shall not depart from Judah , nor a lawgiver from between his feet , until Shiloh come ; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be .
binding his foal unto the vine , and his ass 's colt unto the choice vine ; he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes :
his eyes shall be red with wine , and his teeth white with milk .
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for an haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto Zidon .
and he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant ; and bowed his shoulder to bear , and became a servant unto tribute .
Dan shall be a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heels , so that his Rider shall fall backward .
the archers have sorely grieved him , and shot at him , and hated him :
but his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel : )
even by the God of THY father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
the blessings of THY father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .
Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife ; and there I buried Leah .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph fell upon his father 's face , and wept upon him , and kissed him .
and forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed : and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days .
and when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
and they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite , before Mamre .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , behold , we be THY servants .
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : I will nourish you , and your little ones . and he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
and Joseph dwelt in Egypt , he , and his father 's house : and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years .
and Joseph saw Ephraim 's children of the third generation : the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph 's knees .
so Joseph died , being an hundred and ten years old : and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
and the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
and he said unto his people , behold , the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we :
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . and they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour :
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew Midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
and he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
but the Midwives feared God , and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the men children alive .
and the Midwives said unto Pharaoh , Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are lively , and are delivered ERE the Midwives come in unto them .
therefore God dealt well with the Midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
and it came to pass , because the Midwives feared God , that he made them houses .
and there went a man of the house of Levi , and took to wife a daughter of Levi .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an Ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's brink .
and his sister stood afar off , to wit what would be done to him .
and the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river 's side ; and when she saw the Ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , behold , the babe wept . and she had compassion on him , and said , This is one of the Hebrews ' children .
and Pharaoh 's daughter said unto her , Take this child away , and nurse it for me , and I will give thee THY wages . and the woman took the child , and nursed it .
and the child grew , and she brought him unto Pharaoh 's daughter , and he became her son . and she called his name Moses : and she said , Because I drew him out of the water .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
and when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrews strove together : and he said to him that did the wrong , Wherefore smitest thou THY fellow ?
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
now the priest of Midian had seven daughters : and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father 's flock .
and the shepherds came and drove them away : but Moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
and she bare him a son , and he called his name Gershom : for he said , I have been a stranger in a strange land .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage .
and God heard their groaning , and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .
and God looked upon the children of Israel , and God had respect unto them .
now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb .
and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . and he said , Here am I.
and he said , Draw not nigh hither : put off THY shoes from off THY feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
moreover he said , I am the God of THY father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and the Lord said , I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows ;
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey ; unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
and Moses said unto God , Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
and Moses said unto God , behold , when I come unto the children of Israel , and shall say unto them , The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ?
and God said unto Moses , I AM that I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
and God said moreover unto Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath sent me unto you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey .
and I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and I will stretch out my hand , and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and Moses answered and said , But , behold , they will not believe me , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , The Lord hath not appeared unto thee .
and he said , cast it on the ground . and he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
and the Lord said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into THY bosom . and he put his hand into his bosom : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
and he said , Put thine hand into THY bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto THY voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
and the Lord said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the Lord ?
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with THY mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be THY spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
and the Lord said unto Moses in Midian , Go , return into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought THY life .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the Lord said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay THY son , even THY firstborn .
and it came to pass by the way in the Inn , that the Lord met him , and sought to kill him .
then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
and the Lord said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . and he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kissed him .
and Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him , and all the signs which he had commanded him .
and Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel :
and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
and afterward Moses and Aaron went in , and told Pharaoh , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness .
and the king of Egypt said unto them , Wherefore do ye , Moses and Aaron , let the people from their works ? get you unto your burdens .
and Pharaoh said , behold , the people of the land now are many , and ye make them rest from their burdens .
and Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labour therein ; and let them not regard vain words .
and the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spake to the people , saying , Thus saith Pharaoh , I will not give you straw .
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh , saying , Wherefore dealest thou thus with THY servants ?
there is no straw given unto THY servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , THY servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks .
and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case , after it was said , Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task .
and they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from Pharaoh :
then the Lord said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .
and I have also established my Covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my Covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord .
and Moses spake so unto the children of Israel : but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these be the heads of their fathers ' houses : the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel ; Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi : these be the families of Reuben .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari : and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
and the sons of Kohath ; Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel : and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years .
and the sons of Merari ; Mahali and Mushi : these are the families of Levi according to their generations .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
and the sons of Korah ; Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph : these are the families of the Korhites .
and Eleazar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the Lord said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
and it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt ,
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee : and Aaron THY brother shall speak unto Pharaoh , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
and I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt .
but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them , so did they .
and Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto Pharaoh .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
when Pharaoh shall speak unto you , saying , Shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto Aaron , Take THY rod , and cast it before Pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
and Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the Lord had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers : now the magicians of Egypt , they also did in like manner with their enchantments .
for they cast down every man his rod , and they became Serpents : but Aaron 's rod swallowed up their rods .
and he hardened Pharaoh 's heart , that he hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had said .
get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
thus saith the Lord , In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : behold , I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and the fish that is in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river .
and Moses and Aaron did so , as the Lord commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and smote the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments : and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the Lord had said .
and Pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
and all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and if thou refuse to let them go , behold , I will smite all THY borders with frogs :
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into THY bedchamber , and upon THY bed , and into the house of THY servants , and upon THY people , and into thine ovens , and into THY kneadingtroughs :
and the frogs shall come up both on thee , and upon THY people , and upon all THY servants .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with THY rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from THY houses , and from THY servants , and from THY people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh : and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
but when Pharaoh saw that there was respite , he hardened his heart , and hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had said .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon THY servants , and upon THY people , and into THY houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
and I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth .
and the Lord did so ; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies .
we will go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the Lord our God , as he shall command us .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
and Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
then the Lord said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh , and tell him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still ,
behold , the hand of the Lord is upon THY cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children 's of Israel .
and the Lord appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land .
and the Lord did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron , Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast .
and the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils ; for the boil was upon the magicians , and upon all the Egyptians .
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon THY servants , and upon THY people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and THY people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
he that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the Lord sent Thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , was there no hail .
and Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , I have sinned this time : the Lord is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
Intreat the Lord ( for it is enough ) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and Moses said unto him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord ; and the Thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord 's .
but as for thee and THY servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God .
and the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the Lord had spoken by Moses .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh : for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might shew these my signs before him :
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of THY son , and of THY son 's son , what things I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
and Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh , and said unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will I bring the locusts into THY coast :
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one cannot be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill THY houses , and the houses of all THY servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; which neither THY fathers , nor THY fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day . and he turned himself , and went out from Pharaoh .
and Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord .
and he said unto them , Let the Lord be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the Lord ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste ; and he said , I have sinned against the Lord your God , and against you .
now therefore forgive , I pray thee , my sin only this once , and intreat the Lord your God , that he may take away from me this death only .
and the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
but the Lord hardened Pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , even darkness which may be felt .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
and Pharaoh said unto him , Get thee from me , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let every man borrow of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold .
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Pharaoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and all these THY servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh : and the Lord hardened Pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt , saying ,
speak ye unto all the Congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the Lord 's passover .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the Lord .
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the Congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ?
that ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lord 's passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smote the Egyptians , and delivered our houses . and the people bowed the head and worshipped .
and the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharoah that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
and Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the Lord , as ye have said .
also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . and they spoiled the Egyptians .
and the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
now the sojourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
but every man 's servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
in one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
thus did all the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass the selfsame day , that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
and Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which he sware unto THY fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord .
Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all THY quarters .
and thou shalt shew THY son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the Lord 's law may be in THY mouth : for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to THY fathers , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the Lord 's .
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break his neck : and all the firstborn of man among THY children shalt thou redeem .
and it shall be when THY son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What is this ? that thou shalt say unto him , By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bondage :
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt .
but God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him : for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you .
and they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord . and they did so .
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
but the Egyptians pursued after them , all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , and his horsemen , and his army , and overtook them encamping by the sea , beside Pi @-@ hahiroth , before Baal @-@ zephon .
and when Pharaoh drew nigh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , behold , the Egyptians marched after them ; and they were sore afraid : and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord .
and they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the Lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
but lift thou up THY rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
and the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and the waters returned , and covered the chariots , and the horsemen , and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them ; there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the sea .
the Lord is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father 's God , and I will exalt him .
the Lord is a man of war : the Lord is his name .
Pharaoh 's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea : his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea .
the depths have covered them : they sank into the bottom as a stone .
THY right hand , O Lord , is become glorious in power : THY right hand , O Lord , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth THY wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
and with the blast of THY nostrils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood upright as an heap , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them .
Thou didst blow with THY wind , the sea covered them : they sank as lead in the mighty waters .
Thou in THY mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in THY strength unto THY holy habitation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina .
then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till THY people pass over , O Lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O Lord , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , O Lord , which THY hands have established .
for the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
and Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
so Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and when they came to Marah , they could not drink of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter : therefore the name of it was called Marah .
and he cried unto the Lord ; and the Lord shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
and they came to Elim , where were twelve wells of water , and threescore and ten palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
and they took their journey from Elim , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness :
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
and it came to pass , as Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel : speak unto them , saying , At even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God .
and it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar Frost on the ground .
and when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is manna : for they wist not what it was . and Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat .
this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , Gather of it every man according to his eating , an Omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
and the children of Israel did so , and gathered , some more , some less .
and when they did Mete it with an Omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
and they gathered it every morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses .
and they laid it up till the morning , as Moses bade : and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
see , for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
as the Lord commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
and the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
and all the Congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin , after their journeys , according to the commandment of the Lord , and pitched in Rephidim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and THY rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and Moses said unto Joshua , Choose us out men , and go out , fight with Amalek : to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand .
so Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek : and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
and Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua : for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and the name of the other was Eliezer ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh :
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God :
and he said unto Moses , I THY father in law Jethro am come unto thee , and THY wife , and her two sons with her .
and Moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and Jethro rejoiced for all the Goodness which the Lord had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
and Jethro said , blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods : for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them .
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father in law before God .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
when they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
and Moses ' father in law said unto him , The thing that thou doest is not good .
Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
Hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : be thou for the people to Godward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God :
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens :
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
so Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
and Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
and they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
for they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
and Moses went up unto God , and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on eagles ' wings , and brought you unto myself .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my Covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , All that the Lord hath spoken we will do . and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
and mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke , because the Lord descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly .
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voice .
and the Lord came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
and let the priests also , which come near to the Lord , sanctify themselves , lest the Lord break forth upon them .
and the Lord said unto him , away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest he break forth upon them .
I am the Lord THY God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them : for I the Lord THY God am a Jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ;
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord THY God in vain ; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord THY God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor THY son , nor THY daughter , THY manservant , nor THY maidservant , nor THY cattle , nor THY stranger that is within THY gates :
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
Thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet THY neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is THY neighbour 's .
and all the people saw the thunderings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood afar off .
and the people stood afar off , and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon THY burnt offerings , and THY peace offerings , THY sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up THY tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar , that THY nakedness be not discovered thereon .
if he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or daughters ; the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
and if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free :
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
if he take him another wife ; her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
he that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
but if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour , to slay him with guile ; thou shalt take him from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth his father , or his mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth his father , or his mother , shall surely be put to death .

behold , I send an Angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
beware of him , and obey his voice , provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your transgressions : for my name is in him .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .

and when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even , he shall burn incense upon it , a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations .
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon , nor burnt sacrifice , nor meat offering ; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon .
and Aaron shall make an Atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements : once in the year shall he make Atonement upon it throughout your generations : it is most holy unto the Lord .
when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord , when thou numberest them ; that there be no plague among them , when thou numberest them .
this they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord .
every one that passeth among them that are numbered , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering unto the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for your souls .
Thou shalt also make a laver of brass , and his foot also of brass , to wash withal : and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the Congregation and the altar , and thou shalt put water therein .
for Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat :
take thou also unto thee principal spices , of pure myrrh five hundred shekels , and of sweet Cinnamon half so much , even two hundred and fifty shekels , and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels ,
and of cassia five hundred shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , and of oil olive an hin :
and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment , an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary : it shall be an holy anointing oil .
and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations .
upon man 's flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
Whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight :
and thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together , pure and holy :
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the Congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord .
see , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
and I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
and in cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of timber , to work in all manner of workmanship .
and I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the Ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
and the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot ,
and the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office ,
and the anointing oil , and sweet incense for the holy place : according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do .
speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you .
Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the Lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
and he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , These be THY gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the Lord .
and they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go , get thee down ; for THY people , which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves :
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be THY gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and the Lord said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
and Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doth THY wrath wax hot against THY people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak , and say , For mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ? turn from THY fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against THY people .
and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people .
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , Graven upon the tables .
and when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto Moses , There is a noise of war in the camp .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I hear .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came nigh unto the camp , that he saw the calf , and the dancing : and Moses ' anger waxed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
and when Moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies : )
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the Lord 's side ? let him come unto me . and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
and he said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an Atonement for your sin .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of THY book which thou hast written .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the Lord plagued the people , because they made the calf , which Aaron made .
and the Lord said unto Moses , depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sware unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , unto THY seed will I give it :
and when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
and the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb .
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
now therefore , I pray thee , if I have found grace in THY sight , shew me now THY way , that I may know thee , that I may find grace in THY sight : and consider that this nation is THY people .
and the Lord said unto Moses , I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken : for thou hast found grace in my sight , and I know thee by name .
and he said , I will make all my Goodness pass before thee , and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy .
and he said , Thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live .
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by :
and I will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount .
and no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount .
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
and the Lord descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the Lord .
and Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
for thou shalt worship no other god : for the Lord , whose name is Jealous , is a Jealous God :
Lest thou make a Covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
and thou take of their daughters unto THY sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make THY sons go a whoring after their gods .
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep . seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month Abib : for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . all the firstborn of THY sons thou shalt redeem . and none shall appear before me empty .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year 's end .
Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord God , the God of Israel .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge THY borders : neither shall any man desire THY land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord THY God thrice in the year .
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
the first of the firstfruits of THY land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord THY God . Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother 's milk .
and he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . and he wrote upon the tables the words of the Covenant , the ten commandments .
and it came to pass , when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and Moses called unto them ; and Aaron and all the rulers of the Congregation returned unto him : and Moses talked with them .
and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
and till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a vail on his face .
but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him , he took the vail off , until he came out . and he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Moses gathered all the Congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the Lord hath commanded , that ye should do them .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the Lord : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
and Moses spake unto all the Congregation of the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord commanded , saying ,
and onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
the tabernacle , his tent , and his covering , his taches , and his boards , his bars , his pillars , and his sockets ,
the Ark , and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat , and the vail of the covering ,
the candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
and the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
the altar of burnt offering , with his brasen grate , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
the hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
the pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords ,
the cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest 's office .
and all the Congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord 's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
and every man , with whom was found blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair , and red skins of rams , and badgers ' skins , brought them .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the Lord 's offering : and every man , with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
and the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
and spice , and oil for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
and Moses said unto the children of Israel , See , the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ;
and he hath filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ;
and to devise curious works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in the cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of wood , to make any manner of cunning work .
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
and Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
and all the wise men , that wrought all the work of the sanctuary , came every man from his work which they made ;
and they spake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the Lord commanded to make .
for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work made he them .
the length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were all of one size .
and he coupled the five curtains one unto another : and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he made fifty taches of gold , and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches : so it became one tabernacle .
and he made curtains of goats ' hair for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
the length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain : the eleven curtains were of one size .
and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
and he made a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers ' skins above that .
and he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood , standing up .
the length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
one board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward :
and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
and two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
and they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
and he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other .
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and he made a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubims made he it of cunning work .
and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
and he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , of needlework ;
and the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
and Bezaleel made the Ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half was the length of it , and a cubit and a half the breadth of it , and a cubit and a half the height of it :
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , to be set by the four corners of it ; even two rings upon the one side of it , and two rings upon the other side of it .
and he made staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the Ark , to bear the Ark .
and he made the mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half was the length thereof , and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ;
one cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he made the table of shittim wood : two cubits was the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof :
and he overlaid it with pure gold , and made thereunto a crown of gold round about .
also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about ; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his Shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof :
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch , a Knop and a flower ; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch , a Knop and a flower : so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick .
and a Knop under two branches of the same , and a Knop under two branches of the same , and a Knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made his seven lamps , and his snuffers , and his snuffdishes , of pure gold .
of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
and he made the incense altar of shittim wood : the length of it was a cubit , and the breadth of it a cubit ; it was foursquare ; and two cubits was the height of it ; the horns thereof were of the same .
and he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
and he made the holy anointing oil , and the pure incense of sweet spices , according to the work of the apothecary .
and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
and he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it .
and he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass , to be places for the staves .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with brass .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it withal ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he made the court : on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen , an hundred cubits :
their pillars were twenty , and their brasen sockets twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver .
and for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits , their pillars were twenty , and their sockets of brass twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits , their pillars ten , and their sockets ten ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
the hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : and twenty cubits was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cubits , answerable to the hangings of the court .
and their pillars were four , and their sockets of brass four ; their hooks of silver , and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver .
and all the pins of the tabernacle , and of the court round about , were of brass .
this is the sum of the tabernacle , even of the tabernacle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the commandment of Moses , for the service of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar , son to Aaron the priest .
and Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah , made all that the Lord commanded Moses .
and with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place , even the gold of the offering , was twenty and nine talents , and seven hundred and thirty shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and the silver of them that were numbered of the Congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the vail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , and overlaid their chapiters , and filleted them .
and the brass of the offering was seventy talents , and two thousand and four hundred shekels .
and of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they did beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , and in the purple , and in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , with cunning work .
they made shoulderpieces for it , to couple it together : by the two edges was it coupled together .
and the curious girdle of his ephod , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold , Graven , as signets are Graven , with the names of the children of Israel .
and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he made the breastplate of cunning work , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
and the second row , an Emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
and the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper : they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet , every one with his name , according to the twelve tribes .
and they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends , of wreathen work of pure gold .
and they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate .
and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
and they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
and they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
and they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined linen .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO the Lord .
and they tied unto it a lace of blue , to fasten it on high upon the Mitre ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation finished : and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did they .
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so the children of Israel made all the work .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the Lord had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
on the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation .
and thou shalt put therein the Ark of the testimony , and cover the Ark with the vail .
and thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the Ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the Congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the hanging at the court gate .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering , and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar : and it shall be an altar most holy .
and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot , and sanctify it .
and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt bring his sons , and clothe them with coats :
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
thus did Moses : according to all that the Lord commanded him , so did he .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he took and put the testimony into the Ark , and set the staves on the Ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the Ark :
and he brought the Ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the Ark of the testimony ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he put the table in the tent of the Congregation , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the vail .
and he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord ; as the Lord had commanded Moses .
and he put the candlestick in the tent of the Congregation , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
and he put the golden altar in the tent of the Congregation before the vail :
and he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the Congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he set the laver between the tent of the Congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal .
when they went into the tent of the Congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
then a cloud covered the tent of the Congregation , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the Congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
but if the cloud were not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
for the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .
and the Lord called unto Moses , and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the Congregation , saying ,
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord .
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make Atonement for him .
and he shall kill the bullock before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall flay the burnt offering , and cut it into his pieces .
and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar , and lay the wood in order upon the fire :
and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the fat , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
and if his offering be of the flocks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without blemish .
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and he shall cut it into his pieces , with his head and his fat : and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
but he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water : and the priest shall bring it all , and burn it upon the altar : it is a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls , then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves , or of young pigeons .
and the priest shall bring it unto the altar , and wring off his head , and burn it on the altar ; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar :
and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , by the place of the ashes :
and when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord , his offering shall be of fine flour ; and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frankincense thereon :
and he shall bring it to Aaron 's sons the priests : and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof , and of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof ; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar , to be an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord :
and the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven , it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , or unleavened wafers anointed with oil .
and if THY oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan , it shall be of fine flour unleavened , mingled with oil .
Thou shalt part it in pieces , and pour oil thereon : it is a meat offering .
and if THY oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the Lord : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
and the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the Lord , shall be made with leaven : for ye shall burn no leaven , nor any honey , in any offering of the Lord made by fire .
as for the oblation of the firstfruits , ye shall offer them unto the Lord : but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour .
and every oblation of THY meat offering shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the Covenant of THY God to be lacking from THY meat offering : with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt .
and if thou offer a meat offering of THY firstfruits unto the Lord , thou shalt offer for the meat offering of THY firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire , even corn beaten out of full ears .
and thou shalt put oil upon it , and lay frankincense thereon : it is a meat offering .
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it , part of the beaten corn thereof , and part of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and Aaron 's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish .
if he offer a lamb for his offering , then shall he offer it before the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer thereof his offering , even an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour : all the fat is the Lord 's .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering .
and he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock 's head , and kill the bullock before the Lord .
and the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock 's blood , and bring it to the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord , before the vail of the sanctuary .
and the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord , which is in the tabernacle of the Congregation : and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering .
and if the whole Congregation of Israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
when the sin , which they have sinned against it , is known , then the Congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin , and bring him before the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the elders of the Congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord : and the bullock shall be killed before the Lord .
and the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock 's blood to the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord , even before the vail .
and he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord , that is in the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and he shall take all his fat from him , and burn it upon the altar .
and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an Atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn him as he burned the first bullock : it is a sin offering for the Congregation .
when a ruler hath sinned , and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ;
or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish :
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord : it is a sin offering .
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering , and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering .
and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar .
and he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the Lord ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him , and it shall be forgiven him .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering , and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar :
and he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar , according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord : and the priest shall make an Atonement for his sin that he hath committed , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
or if a soul touch any unclean thing , whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast , or a carcase of unclean cattle , or the carcase of unclean creeping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be unclean , and guilty .
or if he touch the uncleanness of man , whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty .
and it shall be , when he shall be guilty in one of these things , that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing :
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath sinned , a female from the flock , a lamb or a kid of the goats , for a sin offering ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him concerning his sin .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his trespass , which he hath committed , two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , unto the Lord ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar ; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar : it is a sin offering .
and he shall offer the second for a burnt offering , according to the manner : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned , and it shall be forgiven him .
then shall he bring it to the priest , and the priest shall take his handful of it , even a memorial thereof , and burn it on the altar , according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord : it is a sin offering .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these , and it shall be forgiven him : and the remnant shall be the priest 's , as a meat offering .
and he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing , and shall add the fifth part thereto , and give it unto the priest : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock , with THY estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not , and it shall be forgiven him .
or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein :
then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with THY estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein .
command Aaron and his sons , saying , This is the law of the burnt offering : it is the burnt offering , because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning , and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it .
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it ; it shall not be put out : and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning , and lay the burnt offering in order upon it ; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings .
and this is the law of the meat offering : the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord , before the altar .
and he shall take of it his handful , of the flour of the meat offering , and of the oil thereof , and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering , and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour , even the memorial of it , unto the Lord .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eat it .
it shall not be baken with leaven . I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
all the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it . it shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire : every one that toucheth them shall be holy .
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is baken , thou shalt bring it in : and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the Lord , it shall be wholly burnt .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , saying , This is the law of the sin offering : in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord : it is most holy .
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place .
but the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken : and if it be sodden in a brasen pot , it shall be both scoured , and rinsed in water .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the Congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar .
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord : it is a trespass offering .
as the sin offering is , so is the trespass offering : there is one law for them : the priest that maketh Atonement therewith shall have it .
and the priest that offereth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that offereth it .
and every meat offering , mingled with oil , and dry , shall all the sons of Aaron have , one as much as another .
and this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he shall offer unto the Lord .
if he offer it for a Thanksgiving , then he shall offer with the sacrifice of Thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and cakes mingled with oil , of fine flour , fried .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of Thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the Lord , and it shall be the priest 's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for Thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
but if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow , or a voluntary offering , it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice : and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten :
but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire .
and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it : it shall be an abomination , and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity .
and the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten ; it shall be burnt with fire : and as for the flesh , all that be clean shall eat thereof .
but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , that pertain unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
and the fat of the beast that dieth of itself , and the fat of that which is torn with beasts , may be used in any other use : but ye shall in no wise eat of it .
for whosoever eateth the fat of the beast , of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord , even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings .
his own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord .
and the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar : but the breast shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' .
and the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
he among the sons of Aaron , that offereth the blood of the peace offerings , and the fat , shall have the right shoulder for his part .
for the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel .
this is the portion of the anointing of Aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest 's office ;
which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
this is the law of the burnt offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecrations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ;
which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord , in the wilderness of Sinai .
and Moses did as the Lord commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and Moses brought Aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
and he put upon him the coat , and girded him with the girdle , and clothed him with the robe , and put the ephod upon him , and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod , and bound it unto him therewith .
and he put the breastplate upon him : also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim .
and he put the Mitre upon his head ; also upon the Mitre , even upon his forefront , did he put the golden plate , the holy crown ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and Moses took the anointing oil , and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein , and sanctified them .
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all his vessels , both the laver and his foot , to sanctify them .
and he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron 's head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
and Moses brought Aaron 's sons , and put coats upon them , and girded them with girdles , and put bonnets upon them ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he brought the bullock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
and he slew it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar , and sanctified it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
but the bullock , and his hide , his flesh , and his Dung , he burnt with fire without the camp ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he washed the inwards and the legs in water ; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar : it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour , and an offering made by fire unto the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consecration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he slew it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thumbs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
and he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
and out of the basket of unleavened bread , that was before the Lord , he took one unleavened cake , and a cake of oiled bread , and one wafer , and put them on the fat , and upon the right shoulder :
and he put all upon Aaron 's hands , and upon his sons ' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and Moses took them from off their hands , and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering : they were consecrations for a sweet savour : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and Moses took of the anointing oil , and of the blood which was upon the altar , and sprinkled it upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon his sons ' garments with him ; and sanctified Aaron , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons ' garments with him .
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation in seven days , until the days of your consecration be at an end : for seven days shall he consecrate you .
as he hath done this day , so the Lord hath commanded to do , to make an Atonement for you .
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the Lord , that ye die not : for so I am commanded .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that Moses called Aaron and his sons , and the elders of Israel ;
and unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak , saying , Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering ; and a calf and a lamb , both of the first year , without blemish , for a burnt offering ;
and they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and all the Congregation drew near and stood before the Lord .
and Moses said , This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do : and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you .
Aaron therefore went unto the altar , and slew the calf of the sin offering , which was for himself .
and the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him : and he dipped his finger in the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar , and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar :
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp .
and he slew the burnt offering ; and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled round about upon the altar .
and they presented the burnt offering unto him , with the pieces thereof , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
and he did wash the inwards and the legs , and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar .
and he brought the people 's offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
and he brought the burnt offering , and offered it according to the manner .
and he brought the meat offering , and took an handful thereof , and burnt it upon the altar , beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning .
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver :
and they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burnt the fat upon the altar :
and the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the Lord ; as Moses commanded .
and Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and blessed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and peace offerings .
and Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the Congregation , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people .
and there came a fire out from before the Lord , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
and Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his censer , and put fire therein , and put incense thereon , and offered strange fire before the Lord , which he commanded them not .
then Moses said unto Aaron , This is it that the Lord spake , saying , I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me , and before all the people I will be glorified . and Aaron held his peace .
and Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
so they went near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp ; as Moses had said .
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , lest ye die : for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you . and they did according to the word of Moses .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor THY sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the Congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy , and between unclean and clean ;
and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses .
and Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy :
and ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is THY due , and THY sons ' due , of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire : for so I am commanded .
behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron , saying unto them ,
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the Camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and the coney , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and the hare , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and the swine , though he divide the hoof , and be clovenfooted , yet he cheweth not the cud ; he is unclean to you .
of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
these shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
and all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
they shall be even an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall have their carcases in abomination .
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that shall be an abomination unto you .
and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
and the vulture , and the kite after his kind ;
and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
and the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle ,
and the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the BAT .
yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ;
even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
but all other flying creeping things , which have four feet , shall be an abomination unto you .
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
the carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof , and is not clovenfooted , nor cheweth the cud , are unclean unto you : every one that toucheth them shall be unclean .
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
and he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
these are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
and every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it .
of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
and every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are unclean , and shall be unclean unto you .
nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
and if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean .
but if any water be put upon the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
and if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even .
and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
for I am the Lord your God : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
for I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean .
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
but if she bear a maid child , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her separation : and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days .
who shall offer it before the Lord , and make an Atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising , a scab , or a bright spot , and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy ; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest , or unto one of his sons the priests :
and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh : and when the hair in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy : and the priest shall look on him , and pronounce him unclean .
if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
and the priest shall look on him the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more :
and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
and if the priest see that , behold , the scab spreadeth in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a leprosy .
when the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ;
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ;
it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
and if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin , and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot , wheresoever the priest looketh ;
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce him to be unclean : for the raw flesh is unclean : it is a leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be changed unto white , he shall come unto the priest ;
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the plague be turned into white ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : he is clean .
the flesh also , in which , even in the skin thereof , was a boil , and is healed ,
and in the place of the boil there be a white rising , or a bright spot , white , and somewhat reddish , and it be shewed to the priest ;
and if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hairs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and if it spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague .
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
or if there be any flesh , in the skin whereof there is a hot burning , and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot , somewhat reddish , or white ;
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hair in the bright spot , and it be no lower than the other skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
and if the priest look on the plague of the scall , and , behold , it be not in sight deeper than the skin , and that there is no black hair in it ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days :
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague : and , behold , if the scall spread not , and there be in it no yellow hair , and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin ;
he shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more :
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
then the priest shall look on him : and , behold , if the scall be spread in the skin , the priest shall not seek for yellow hair ; he is unclean .
but if the scall be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the scall is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
then the priest shall look : and , behold , if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white ; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin ; he is clean .
and the man whose hair is fallen off his head , he is bald ; yet is he clean .
and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead bald : yet is he clean .
and if there be in the bald head , or bald forehead , a white reddish sore ; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head , or his bald forehead .
then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ;
he is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is in his head .
and the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , Unclean , unclean .
all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled ; he is unclean : he shall dwell alone ; without the camp shall his habitation be .
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in the warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of leprosy , and shall be shewed unto the priest :
and the priest shall look upon the plague , and shut up it that hath the plague seven days :
and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day : if the plague be spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in a skin , or in any work that is made of skin ; the plague is a fretting leprosy ; it is unclean .
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if the priest shall look , and , behold , the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ;
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall rend it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the warp , or out of the woof :
and if it appear still in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a spreading plague : thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire .
and the garment , either warp , or woof , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean .
this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen , either in the warp , or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : he shall be brought unto the priest :
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
and he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and wash himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish , and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , and one log of oil .
and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the Lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall take one he lamb , and offer him for a trespass offering , and the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the Lord :
and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the trespass offering : it is most holy :
and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot :
and the priest shall take some of the log of oil , and pour it into the palm of his own left hand :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord :
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass offering :
and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
and the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make an Atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering :
and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make an Atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
and two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , before the Lord .
and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord :
and he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering , and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot :
and the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand :
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord :
and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering :
and the rest of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an Atonement for him before the Lord .
this is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
when ye be come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
then the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house :
and he shall look on the plague , and , behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes , greenish or reddish , which in sight are lower than the wall ;
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days :
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city :
and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
and if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after that he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plaistered ;
then the priest shall come and look , and , behold , if the plague be spread in the house , it is a fretting leprosy in the house : it is unclean .
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even .
and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
and if the priest shall come in , and look upon it , and , behold , the plague hath not spread in the house , after the house was plaistered : then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water :
and he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times :
and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird , and with the running water , and with the living bird , and with the cedar wood , and with the hyssop , and with the scarlet :
but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields , and make an Atonement for the house : and it shall be clean .
this is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy , and scall ,
and the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue : whether his flesh run with his issue , or his flesh be stopped from his issue , it is his uncleanness .
every bed , whereon he lieth that hath the issue , is unclean : and every thing , whereon he sitteth , shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean ; then he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even : and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and the vessel of earth , that he toucheth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for him before the Lord for his issue .
and if any man 's seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
and every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
the woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation , they shall both bathe themselves in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if a woman have an issue , and her issue in her flesh be blood , she shall be put apart seven days : and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even .
and every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean : every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if it be on her bed , or on any thing whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
and if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean .
every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation : and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean , as the uncleanness of her separation .
and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
but if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
and on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles , or two young pigeons , and bring them unto the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an Atonement for her before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
thus shall Aaron come into the holy place : with a young bullock for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering .
he shall put on the holy linen coat , and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh , and shall be girded with a linen girdle , and with the linen Mitre shall he be attired : these are holy garments ; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water , and so put them on .
and Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and make an Atonement for himself , and for his house .
and he shall take the two goats , and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats ; one lot for the Lord , and the other lot for the scapegoat .
and Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord 's lot fell , and offer him for a sin offering .
but the goat , on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat , shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an Atonement with him , and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness .
and Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an Atonement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the vail :
and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
and he shall take of the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times .
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the vail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat :
and he shall make an Atonement for the holy place , because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel , and because of their transgressions in all their sins : and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the Congregation , that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness .
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the Congregation when he goeth in to make an Atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an Atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the Congregation of Israel .
and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord , and make an Atonement for it ; and shall take of the blood of the bullock , and of the blood of the goat , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about .
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and cleanse it , and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel .
and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the altar , he shall bring the live goat :
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
and Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there :
and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place , and put on his garments , and come forth , and offer his burnt offering , and the burnt offering of the people , and make an Atonement for himself , and for the people .
and the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar .
and he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp .
and the bullock for the sin offering , and the goat for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make Atonement in the holy place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall burn in the fire their skins , and their flesh , and their Dung .
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
and this shall be a statute for ever unto you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall afflict your souls , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger that sojourneth among you :
for on that day shall the priest make an Atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord .
and the priest , whom he shall anoint , and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest 's office in his father 's stead , shall make the Atonement , and shall put on the linen clothes , even the holy garments :
and he shall make an Atonement for the holy sanctuary , and he shall make an Atonement for the tabernacle of the Congregation , and for the altar , and he shall make an Atonement for the priests , and for all the people of the Congregation .
speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , saying ,
what man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the Lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord .
and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring . this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
and thou shalt say unto them , whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers which sojourn among you , that offereth a burnt offering of sacrifice ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , to offer it unto the Lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
and whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
for the life of the flesh is in the blood : and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an Atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that maketh an Atonement for the soul .
therefore I said unto the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
and whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
but if he wash them not , nor bathe his flesh ; then he shall bear his iniquity .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , I am the Lord your God .
after the doings of the land of Egypt , wherein ye dwelt , shall ye not do : and after the doings of the land of Canaan , whither I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordinances .
Ye shall do my judgments , and keep mine ordinances , to walk therein : I am the Lord your God .
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes , and my judgments : which if a man do , he shall live in them : I am the Lord .
none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : I am the Lord .
the nakedness of THY father , or the nakedness of THY mother , shalt thou not uncover : she is THY mother ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
the nakedness of THY father 's wife shalt thou not uncover : it is THY father 's nakedness .
the nakedness of THY sister , the daughter of THY father , or daughter of THY mother , whether she be born at home , or born abroad , even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover .
the nakedness of THY son 's daughter , or of THY daughter 's daughter , even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover : for theirs is thine own nakedness .
the nakedness of THY father 's wife 's daughter , begotten of THY father , she is THY sister , thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY father 's sister : she is THY father 's near kinswoman .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY mother 's sister : for she is THY mother 's near kinswoman .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY father 's brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY daughter in law : she is THY son 's wife ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY brother 's wife : it is THY brother 's nakedness .
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to uncover her nakedness ; for they are her near kinswomen : it is wickedness .
neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister , to vex her , to uncover her nakedness , beside the other in her life time .
also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness .
moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with THY neighbour 's wife , to defile thyself with her .
and thou shalt not let any of THY seed pass through the fire to Molech , neither shalt thou profane the name of THY God : I am the Lord .
neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it is confusion .
Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you :
and the land is defiled : therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants .
Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ; )
that the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you .
for whosoever shall commit any of these abominations , even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs , which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein : I am the Lord your God .
speak unto all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the Lord your God am holy .
Ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the Lord your God .
and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , ye shall offer it at your own will .
and if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is abominable ; it shall not be accepted .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of THY field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of THY harvest .
and thou shalt not glean THY vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of THY vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the Lord your God .
and ye shall not swear by my name falsely , neither shalt thou profane the name of THY God : I am the Lord .
Thou shalt not defraud THY neighbour , neither rob him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
Thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind , but shalt fear THY God : I am the Lord .
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge THY neighbour .
Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among THY people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of THY neighbour : I am the Lord .
Thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of THY people , but thou shalt love THY neighbour as thyself : I am the Lord .
Ye shall keep my statutes . Thou shalt not let THY cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow THY field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .
and whosoever lieth carnally with a woman , that is a bondmaid , betrothed to an husband , and not at all redeemed , nor freedom given her ; she shall be scourged ; they shall not be put to death , because she was not free .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , even a ram for a trespass offering .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done : and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him .
and when ye shall come into the land , and shall have planted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised : three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you : it shall not be eaten of .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the Lord your God .
Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantment , nor observe times .
Ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of THY beard .
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the Lord .
do not prostitute THY daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
regard not them that have familiar spirits , neither seek after wizards , to be defiled by them : I am the Lord your God .
Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honour the face of the old man , and fear THY God : I am the Lord .
but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just hin , shall ye have : I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
therefore shall ye observe all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : I am the Lord .
again , thou shalt say to the children of Israel , Whosoever he be of the children of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel , that giveth any of his seed unto Molech ; he shall surely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
and I will set my face against that man , and will cut him off from among his people ; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech , to defile my sanctuary , and to profane my holy name .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he giveth of his seed unto Molech , and kill him not :
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a whoring after him , to commit whoredom with Molech , from among their people .
and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
Sanctify yourselves therefore , and be ye holy : for I am the Lord your God .
for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath Cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
and the man that committeth adultery with another man 's wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour 's wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
and the man that lieth with his father 's wife hath uncovered his father 's nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man take a wife and her mother , it is wickedness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no wickedness among you .
and if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast .
and if a woman approach unto any beast , and lie down thereto , thou shalt kill the woman , and the beast : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall uncover her nakedness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
and thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of THY mother 's sister , nor of THY father 's sister : for he uncovereth his near kin : they shall bear their iniquity .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother 's nakedness ; they shall be childless .
Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither I bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I abhorred them .
but I have said unto you , Ye shall inherit their land , and I will give it unto you to possess it , a land that floweth with milk and honey : I am the Lord your God , which have separated you from other people .
Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean , and between unclean fowls and clean : and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast , or by fowl , or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground , which I have separated from you as unclean .
and ye shall be holy unto me : for I the Lord am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
and for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
but he shall not defile himself , being a chief man among his people , to profane himself .
they shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
they shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God : for the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
Thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of THY God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the Lord , which sanctify you , am holy .
and the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the whore , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ;
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the Lord .
a widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
speak unto Aaron , saying , Whosoever he be of THY seed in their generations that hath any blemish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his God .
for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous ,
or crookbackt , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or be scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
he shall eat the bread of his God , both of the most holy , and of the holy .
only he shall not go in unto the vail , nor come nigh unto the altar , because he hath a blemish ; that he profane not my sanctuaries : for I the Lord do sanctify them .
and Moses told it unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the Lord .
say unto them , Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from my presence : I am the Lord .
or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
the soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
that which dieth of itself , or is torn with beasts , he shall not eat to defile himself therewith : I am the Lord .
they shall therefore keep mine ordinance , lest they bear sin for it , and die therefore , if they profane it : I the Lord do sanctify them .
there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing : a sojourner of the priest , or an hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the priest 's daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the Lord ;
Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish , of the beeves , of the sheep , or of the goats .
but whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a Wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the Lord , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord .
either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts , that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering ; but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
neither from a stranger 's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and blemishes be in them : they shall not be accepted for you .
and whether it be cow or ewe , ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day .
and when ye will offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto the Lord , offer it at your own will .
on the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : I am the Lord .
neither shall ye profane my holy name ; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel : I am the Lord which hallow you ,
that brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the Lord .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , concerning the feasts of the Lord , which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , even these are my feasts .
six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings .
these are the feasts of the Lord , even holy convocations , which ye shall proclaim in their seasons .
and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord : seven days ye must eat unleavened bread .
in the first day ye shall have an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days : in the seventh day is an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest :
and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor parched corn , nor green ears , until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath , from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering ; seven sabbaths shall be complete :
even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days ; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord .
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals : they shall be of fine flour ; they shall be baken with leaven ; they are the firstfruits unto the Lord .
and ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year , and one young bullock , and two rams : they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord , with their meat offering , and their drink offerings , even an offering made by fire , of sweet savour unto the Lord .
then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering , and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
and the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the Lord , with the two lambs : they shall be holy to the Lord for the priest .
and ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of THY field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of THY harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the Lord your God .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , In the seventh month , in the first day of the month , shall ye have a sabbath , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , an holy convocation .
Ye shall do no servile work therein : but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of Atonement : it shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall afflict your souls , and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of Atonement , to make an Atonement for you before the Lord your God .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day , the same soul will I destroy from among his people .
Ye shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
it shall be unto you a sabbath of rest , and ye shall afflict your souls : in the ninth day of the month at even , from even unto even , shall ye celebrate your sabbath .
on the first day shall be an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord : on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord : it is a solemn assembly ; and ye shall do no servile work therein .
beside the sabbaths of the Lord , and beside your gifts , and beside all your vows , and beside all your freewill offerings , which ye give unto the Lord .
also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days : on the first day shall be a sabbath , and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath .
and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees , branches of palm trees , and the boughs of thick trees , and willows of the Brook ; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days .
and ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year . it shall be a statute for ever in your generations : ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month .
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days ; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths :
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
without the vail of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the Congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the Lord continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before the Lord .
and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual statute .
and the son of an Israelitish woman , whose father was an Egyptian , went out among the children of Israel : and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
and the Israelitish woman 's son blasphemed the name of the Lord , and Cursed . and they brought him unto Moses : ( and his mother 's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan : )
and they put him in ward , that the mind of the Lord might be shewed them .
bring forth him that hath Cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the Congregation stone him .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin .
and he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord , he shall surely be put to death , and all the Congregation shall certainly stone him : as well the stranger , as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth : as he hath caused a blemish in a man , so shall it be done to him again .
and he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
Ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the Lord your God .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord .
six years thou shalt sow THY field , and six years thou shalt prune THY vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the Lord : thou shalt neither sow THY field , nor prune THY vineyard .
that which groweth of its own accord of THY harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of THY vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for THY servant , and for THY maid , and for THY hired servant , and for THY stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and for THY cattle , and for the beast that are in THY land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of THY vine undressed .
for it is the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
and if thou sell ought unto THY neighbour , or buyest ought of THY neighbour 's hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of THY neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
Ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear THY God : for I am the Lord your God .
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield her fruit , and he shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and if ye shall say , What shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase :
then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for three years .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
if THY brother be waxen poor , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
notwithstanding the cities of the Levites , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the Levites redeem at any time .
and if a man purchase of the Levites , then the house that was sold , and the city of his possession , shall go out in the year of jubile : for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
and if THY brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
take thou no usury of him , or increase : but fear THY God ; that THY brother may live with thee .
Thou shalt not give him THY money upon usury , nor lend him THY victuals for increase .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
and if THY brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sold unto thee ; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant :
but as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
for they are my servants , which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .
both THY bondmen , and THY bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land : and they shall be your possession .
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession ; they shall be your bondmen for ever : but over your brethren the children of Israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
if there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him : and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in THY sight .
and if he be not redeemed in these years , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and his children with him .
for unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
Ye shall make you no idols nor Graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the Lord your God .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
and ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
for I will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my Covenant with you .
and I will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and I will walk among you , and will be your God , and ye shall be my people .
I am the Lord your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my Covenant :
and I will set my face against you , and ye shall be slain before your enemies : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me , then I will punish you seven times more for your sins .
and I will break the pride of your power ; and I will make your heaven as iron , and your earth as brass :
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me ; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things , but will walk contrary unto me ;
then will I also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven times for your sins .
and I will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my Covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and when I have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury ; and I , even I , will chastise you seven times for your sins .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
and I will make your cities waste , and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours .
and I will bring the land into desolation : and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it .
and I will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be desolate , and your cities waste .
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in your enemies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sabbaths .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it did not rest in your sabbaths , when ye dwelt upon it .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies .
and ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up .
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
if they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity :
then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob , and also my Covenant with Isaac , and also my Covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
the land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sabbaths , while she lieth desolate without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity : because , even because they despised my judgments , and because their soul abhorred my statutes .
but I will for their sakes remember the Covenant of their ancestors , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen , that I might be their God : I am the Lord .
these are the statutes and judgments and laws , which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When a man shall make a singular vow , the persons shall be for the Lord by THY estimation .
and THY estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even THY estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and if it be a female , then THY estimation shall be thirty shekels .
and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , then THY estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
and if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then THY estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female THY estimation shall be three shekels of silver .
and if it be from sixty years old and above ; if it be a male , then THY estimation shall be fifteen shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
but if he be poorer than THY estimation , then he shall present himself before the priest , and the priest shall value him ; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him .
and if it be a beast , whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord , all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valuest it , who art the priest , so shall it be .
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of THY estimation unto it , and it shall be his .
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile , according to THY estimation it shall stand .
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of THY estimation unto it , and it shall be assured to him .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
but the field , when it goeth out in the jubile , shall be holy unto the Lord , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest 's .
and if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought , which is not of the fields of his possession ;
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
and all THY estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs shall be the shekel .
only the firstling of the beasts , which should be the Lord 's firstling , no man shall sanctify it ; whether it be ox , or sheep : it is the Lord 's .
none devoted , which shall be devoted of men , shall be redeemed ; but shall surely be put to death .
and all the tithe of the land , whether of the seed of the land , or of the fruit of the tree , is the Lord 's : it is holy unto the Lord .
and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes , he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof .
and concerning the tithe of the herd , or of the flock , even of whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord .
he shall not search whether it be good or bad , neither shall he change it : and if he change it at all , then both it and the change thereof shall be holy ; it shall not be redeemed .

even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi , neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel :
and when the tabernacle setteth forward , the Levites shall take it down : and when the tabernacle is to be pitched , the Levites shall set it up : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and the children of Israel shall pitch their tents , every man by his own camp , and every man by his own standard , throughout their hosts .
but the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the Congregation of the children of Israel : and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
and on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies : and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah .

these are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers : all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
but the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses : so they pitched by their standards , and so they set forward , every one after their families , according to the house of their fathers .
these also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spake with Moses in mount Sinai .
and these are the names of the sons of Aaron ; Nadab the firstborn , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
these are the names of the sons of Aaron , the priests which were anointed , whom he consecrated to minister in the priest 's office .
bring the tribe of Levi near , and present them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister unto him .
and they shall keep his charge , and the charge of the whole Congregation before the tabernacle of the Congregation , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons : they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and I , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel : therefore the Levites shall be mine ;
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , saying ,
number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .
and Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord , as he was commanded .
and these were the sons of Levi by their names ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari .

and under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and the sockets thereof , and all the vessels thereof , and all that serveth thereto ,
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords .
all that were numbered of the Levites , which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the Lord , throughout their families , all the males from a month old and upward , were twenty and two thousand .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
and thou shalt take the Levites for me ( I am the Lord ) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel ; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel .
and all the firstborn males by the number of names , from a month old and upward , of those that were numbered of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen .
take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel , and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle ; and the Levites shall be mine : I am the Lord .
and for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel , which are more than the Levites ;
Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll , after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them : ( the shekel is twenty gerahs : )
and thou shalt give the money , wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed , unto Aaron and to his sons .
and Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites :
of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons , according to the word of the Lord , as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
this shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the Congregation , about the most holy things :
and when the camp setteth forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering vail , and cover the Ark of testimony with it :
and shall put thereon the covering of badgers ' skins , and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue , and shall put in the staves thereof .
and upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon :

and they shall take a cloth of blue , and cover the candlestick of the light , and his lamps , and his tongs , and his snuffdishes , and all the oil vessels thereof , wherewith they minister unto it :
and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put it upon a bar .
and upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue , and cover it with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put to the staves thereof :
and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , wherewith they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
and they shall take away the ashes from the altar , and spread a purple cloth thereon :

and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites :
take also the sum of the sons of Gershon , throughout the houses of their fathers , by their families ;
from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tabernacle of the Congregation .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the Congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
as for the sons of Merari , thou shalt number them after their families , by the house of their fathers ;
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them , every one that entereth into the service , to do the work of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the Congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof ,
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Merari , according to all their service , in the tabernacle of the Congregation , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
and those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty .
these were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites , all that might do service in the tabernacle of the Congregation , which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
even those that were numbered of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fathers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon , of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the Congregation , whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the Lord .
and those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari , throughout their families , by the house of their fathers ,
even those that were numbered of them after their families , were three thousand and two hundred .
these be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari , whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
even those that were numbered of them , were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore .
command the children of Israel , that they put out of the camp every leper , and every one that hath an issue , and whosoever is defiled by the dead :
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the Lord spake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
and every man 's hallowed things shall be his : whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be his .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man 's wife go aside , and commit a trespass against him ,
and a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be Jealous of his wife , and she be defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be Jealous of his wife , and she be not defiled :
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
and the priest shall set the woman before the Lord , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of THY husband , and if thou be defiled , and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband :
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , The Lord make thee a curse and an oath among THY people , when the Lord doth make THY thigh to rot , and THY belly to swell ;
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into THY bowels , to make THY belly to swell , and THY thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , Amen , amen .
and the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
this is the law of jealousies , when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband , and is defiled ;
or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him , and he be Jealous over his wife , and shall set the woman before the Lord , and the priest shall execute upon her all this law .
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink , and shall drink no vinegar of wine , or vinegar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes , nor eat moist grapes , or dried .
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels even to the husk .
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
all the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall come at no dead body .
he shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consecration of his God is upon his head .
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the Lord .
and if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he shave it .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an Atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
and he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
and this is the law of the Nazarite , when the days of his separation are fulfilled : he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and he shall offer his offering unto the Lord , one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings ,
and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings .
and the priest shall bring them before the Lord , and shall offer his sin offering , and his burnt offering :
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord , with the basket of unleavened bread : the priest shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord : this is holy for the priest , with the wave breast and heave shoulder : and after that the Nazarite may drink wine .
speak unto Aaron and unto his sons , saying , On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel , saying unto them ,
the Lord make his face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee :
and it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle , and had anointed it , and sanctified it , and all the instruments thereof , both the altar and all the vessels thereof , and had anointed them , and sanctified them ;
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
and Moses took the wagons and the oxen , and gave them unto the Levites .
two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon , according to their service :
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari , according unto their service , under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest .
but unto the sons of Kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab , of the tribe of Judah :
and his offering was one silver charger , the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :

this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve chargers of silver , twelve silver bowls , twelve spoons of gold :
each charger of silver weighing an hundred and thirty shekels , each bowl seventy : all the silver vessels weighed two thousand and four hundred shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
the golden spoons were twelve , full of incense , weighing ten shekels apiece , after the shekel of the sanctuary : all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty shekels .
all the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks , the rams twelve , the lambs of the first year twelve , with their meat offering : and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve .
and all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty and four bullocks , the rams sixty , the he goats sixty , the lambs of the first year sixty . this was the dedication of the altar , after that it was anointed .
speak unto Aaron , and say unto him , When thou lightest the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick .
and Aaron did so ; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick , as the Lord commanded Moses .
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the Shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
and thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle water of purifying upon them , and let them shave all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering , even fine flour mingled with oil , and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering .
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the Congregation : and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together :
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites :
and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may execute the service of the Lord .
and the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , unto the Lord , to make an Atonement for the Levites .
and thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the Lord .
thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel : and the Levites shall be mine .
and after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them for an offering .
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me .
for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself .
and I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the Congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and the Levites were purified , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord ; and Aaron made an Atonement for them to cleanse them .
and after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the Congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
this is it that belongeth unto the Levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation :
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof , and shall serve no more :
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the Congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge .
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
in the fourteenth day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the rites of it , and according to all the ceremonies thereof , shall ye keep it .
and Moses spake unto the children of Israel , that they should keep the passover .
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai : according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did the children of Israel .
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it , and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
they shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it .
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and forbeareth to keep the passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
so it was alway : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
at the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord , and journeyed not .
and so it was , when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle ; according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents , and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of Israel abode in their tents , and journeyed not : but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
at the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the Lord they journeyed : they kept the charge of the Lord , at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
make thee two trumpets of silver ; of a whole piece shalt thou make them : that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the journeying of the camps .
and when they shall blow with them , all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and if they blow but with one trumpet , then the princes , which are heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather themselves unto thee .
when ye blow an alarm , then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
but when the Congregation is to be gathered together , ye shall blow , but ye shall not sound an alarm .
and the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow with the trumpets ; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran .
and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies : and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon .
and the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward , bearing the tabernacle .
and the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
and the Kohathites set forward , bearing the sanctuary : and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni .
and the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts : and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan .
thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and he said , Leave us not , I pray thee ; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes .
and it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what Goodness the Lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee .
and they departed from the mount of the Lord three days ' journey : and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day , when they went out of the camp .
and it came to pass , when the Ark set forward , that Moses said , Rise up , Lord , and let thine enemies be scattered ; and let them that hate thee flee before thee .
and when the people complained , it displeased the Lord : and the Lord heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp .
and the people cried unto Moses ; and when Moses prayed unto the Lord , the fire was quenched .
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick :
and the manna was as coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night , the manna fell upon it .
then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased .
and Moses said unto the Lord , Wherefore hast thou afflicted THY servant ? and wherefore have I not found favour in THY sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me ?
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto me , saying , Give us flesh , that we may eat .
I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in THY sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the Congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
Ye shall not eat one day , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ;
but even a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils , and it be loathsome unto you : because that ye have despised the Lord which is among you , and have wept before him , saying , Why came we forth out of Egypt ?
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
and Moses went out , and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them round about the tabernacle .
and the Lord came down in a cloud , and spake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
and Moses gat him into the camp , he and the elders of Israel .
and there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day 's journey on this side , and as it were a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ERE it was chewed , the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people , and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague .
and Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Ethiopian woman .
( now the man Moses was very meek , above all the men which were upon the face of the earth . )
and the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses , and unto Aaron , and unto Miriam , Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the Congregation . and they three came out .
and the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth .
and he said , Hear now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
with him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , Miriam became leprous , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Miriam , and , behold , she was leprous .
and Aaron said unto Moses , Alas , my lord , I beseech thee , lay not the sin upon us , wherein we have done foolishly , and wherein we have sinned .
let her not be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother 's womb .
and Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days : and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again .
and Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the wilderness of Paran : all those men were heads of the children of Israel .
and these were their names : of the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the son of Zaccur .
of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori .
of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
of the tribe of Ephraim , Oshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of Benjamin , Palti the son of Raphu .
of the tribe of Joseph , namely , of the tribe of Manasseh , Gaddi the son of Susi .
of the tribe of Asher , Sethur the son of Michael .
of the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi the son of Vophsi .
of the tribe of Gad , Geuel the son of Machi .
these are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land . and Moses called Oshea the son of nun Jehoshua .
and Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said unto them , Get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain :
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ;
so they went up , and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob , as men come to Hamath .
and they ascended by the south , and came unto Hebron ; where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were . ( now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
and they came unto the Brook of Eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
the place was called the Brook Eshcol , because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence .
and they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel , unto the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the Congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
and they told him , and said , We came unto the land whither thou sentest us , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this is the fruit of it .
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land , and the cities are walled , and very great : and moreover we saw the children of Anak there .
the Amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the Hittites , and the Jebusites , and the Amorites , dwell in the mountains : and the Canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of Jordan .
and Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it .
and there we saw the giants , the sons of Anak , which come of the giants : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight .
and all the Congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole Congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
and wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ? were it not better for us to return into Egypt ?
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Congregation of the children of Israel .
and Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
if the Lord delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the Lord is with us : fear them not .
but all the Congregation bade stone them with stones . and the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the Congregation before all the children of Israel .
and the Lord said unto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ERE they believe me , for all the signs which I have shewed among them ?
and now , I beseech thee , let the power of my Lord be great , according as thou hast spoken , saying ,
the Lord is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
pardon , I beseech thee , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of THY mercy , and as thou hast forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
but my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and hath followed me fully , him will I bring into the land whereinto he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
( now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley . ) To morrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
say unto them , As truly as I live , saith the Lord , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will I do to you :
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein , save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of nun .
but your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised .
but as for you , your carcases , they shall fall in this wilderness .
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the Lord have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil Congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the Congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the Lord .
but Joshua the son of nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
and Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel : and the people mourned greatly .
and they rose up early in the morning , and gat them up into the top of the mountain , saying , Lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised : for we have sinned .
go not up , for the Lord is not among you ; that ye be not smitten before your enemies .
for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you .
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and Moses , departed not out of the camp .
then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you ,
and will make an offering by fire unto the Lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the Lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil .
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the Lord :
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil .
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
thus shall it be done for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
according to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord .
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the Congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the Lord .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you ,
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord .
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave offering in your generations .
then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the Congregation , that all the Congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the Lord , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord , and their sin offering before the Lord , for their ignorance :
and it shall be forgiven all the Congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
and the priest shall make an Atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an Atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
because he hath despised the word of the Lord , and hath broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be upon him .
and while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron , and unto all the Congregation .
and they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
and the Lord said unto Moses , The man shall be surely put to death : all the Congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
and all the Congregation brought him without the camp , and stoned him with stones , and he died ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue :
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the Lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring :
I am the Lord your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the Lord your God .
and put fire therein , and put incense in them before the Lord to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the Lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi .
and Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab : which said , We will not come up :
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ?
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up .
and Moses was very wroth , and said unto the Lord , Respect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
and take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also , and Aaron , each of you his censer .
and they took every man his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron .
and Korah gathered all the Congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the Congregation .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
and Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
so they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
and Moses said , Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works ; for I have not done them of mine own mind .
if these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the visitation of all men ; then the Lord hath not sent me .
and it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground clave asunder that was under them :
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the Congregation .
and all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them : for they said , Lest the earth swallow us up also .
and there came out a fire from the Lord , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense .
speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder ; for they are hallowed .
but on the morrow all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye have killed the people of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the Congregation : and , behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the Lord appeared .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the Congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an Atonement for the people .
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside them that died about the matter of Korah .
speak unto the children of Israel , and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers , of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods : write thou every man 's name upon his rod .
and thou shalt write Aaron 's name upon the rod of Levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers .
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the Congregation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and it shall come to pass , that the man 's rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
and Moses spake unto the children of Israel , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
and it came to pass , that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness ; and , behold , the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded , and brought forth buds , and bloomed blossoms , and yielded almonds .
and Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
and they shall keep THY charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar : that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel .
and I , behold , I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel : to you they are given as a gift for the Lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and the Lord spake unto Aaron , behold , I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel ; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing , and to THY sons , by an ordinance for ever .
this shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for THY sons .
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord , them have I given thee .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the Lord , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
and the flesh of them shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine .
and the Lord spake unto Aaron , Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou have any part among them : I am THY part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
and , behold , I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the Congregation , lest they bear sin , and die .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an heave offering unto the Lord , I have given to the Levites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus speak unto the Levites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the tithe .
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you , as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the Lord 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord , of all the best thereof , even the hallowed part thereof out of it .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , When ye have heaved the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heaved from it the best of it : neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel , lest ye die .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and upon which never came yoke :
and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall slay her before his face :
and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the Congregation seven times :
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her Dung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel : because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
this is the law , when a man dieth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the Congregation , because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord : the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him ; he is unclean .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
and there was no water for the Congregation : and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
and the people chode with Moses , and spake , saying , Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord !
and why have ye brought up the Congregation of the Lord into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt , to bring us in unto this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink .
and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them .
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the Congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron , Because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I have given them .
and Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom , Thus saith THY brother Israel , Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us :
how our fathers went down into Egypt , and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time ; and the Egyptians vexed us , and our fathers :
and when we cried unto the Lord , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of Egypt : and , behold , we are in Kadesh , a city in the uttermost of THY border :
thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border : wherefore Israel turned away from him .
and the children of Israel , even the whole Congregation , journeyed from Kadesh , and came unto mount Hor .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor , by the coast of the land of Edom , saying ,
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount Hor :
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
and Moses did as the Lord commanded : and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the Congregation .
and Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount .
and when all the Congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mourned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
and when king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said , If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities .
and the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hormah .
and they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea , to compass the land of Edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
and the Lord sent fiery Serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of Israel died .
therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sinned , for we have spoken against the Lord , and against thee ; pray unto the Lord , that he take away the Serpents from us . and Moses prayed for the people .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bitten , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
and Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it came to pass , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass , he lived .
and the children of Israel set forward , and pitched in Oboth .
and they journeyed from Oboth , and pitched at Ije @-@ abarim , in the wilderness which is before Moab , toward the sunrising .
from thence they removed , and pitched in the valley of Zared .
from thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites : for Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord , What he did in the Red sea , and in the brooks of Arnon ,
and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar , and lieth upon the border of Moab .
and from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the Lord spake unto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
the princes digged the well , the nobles of the people digged it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with their staves . and from the wilderness they went to Mattanah :
and from Bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looketh toward Jeshimon .
let me pass through THY land : we will not turn into the fields , or into the vineyards ; we will not drink of the waters of the well : but we will go along by the king 's high way , until we be past THY borders .
and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
and Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon : for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
and Israel took all these cities : and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , in Heshbon , and in all the villages thereof .
for Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who had fought against the former king of Moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Arnon .
for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon : it hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lords of the high places of Arnon .
Woe to thee , Moab ! thou art undone , O people of Chemosh : he hath given his sons that escaped , and his daughters , into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites .
we have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon , and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
so they smote him , and his sons , and all his people , until there was none left him alive : and they possessed his land .
and the children of Israel set forward , and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho .
and Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
and Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
and the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
and Balaam said unto God , Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , hath sent unto me , saying ,
behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and Balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Balak , Get you into your land : for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
and the princes of Moab rose up , and they went unto Balak , and said , Balaam refuseth to come with us .
and they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
for I will promote thee unto very great honour , and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me : come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
and Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak , If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God , to do less or more .
now therefore , I pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more .
and God came unto Balaam at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and Balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his ass , and went with the princes of Moab .
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
but the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
and the angel of the Lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam : and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
and Balaam said unto the ass , Because thou hast mocked me : I would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would I kill thee .
then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the Lord said unto him , Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times ? behold , I went out to withstand thee , because THY way is perverse before me :
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , surely now also I had slain thee , and saved her alive .
and Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord , I have sinned ; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me : now therefore , if it displease thee , I will get me back again .
and the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
and when Balak heard that Balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab , which is in the border of Arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
and Balak said unto Balaam , did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not unto me ? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
and Balaam said unto Balak , Lo , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
and Balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Balak took Balaam , and brought him up into the high places of Baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
and Balak did as Balaam had spoken ; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram .
and God met Balaam : and he said unto him , I have prepared seven altars , and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
and he returned unto him , and , lo , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , he , and all the princes of Moab .
how shall I curse , whom God hath not Cursed ? or how shall I defy , whom the Lord hath not defied ?
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and he answered and said , Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth ?
and he brought him into the field of Zophim , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him . and Balak said unto him , What hath the Lord spoken ?
behold , I have received commandment to bless : and he hath blessed ; and I cannot reverse it .
he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel : the Lord his God is with him , and the shout of a king is among them .
God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn .
surely there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
but Balaam answered and said unto Balak , told not I thee , saying , All that the Lord speaketh , that I must do ?
and Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor , that looketh toward Jeshimon .
and Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
he hath said , which heard the words of God , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
as the valleys are they spread forth , as gardens by the river 's side , as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted , and as cedar trees beside the waters .
he shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
God brought him forth out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn : he shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones , and Pierce them through with his arrows .
he couched , he lay down as a lion , and as a great lion : who shall stir him up ? blessed is he that blesseth thee , and Cursed is he that curseth thee .
and Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee thou to THY place : I thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the Lord hath kept thee back from honour .
and now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to THY people in the latter days .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
he hath said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
and Edom shall be a possession , Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies ; and Israel shall do valiantly .
and when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and he looked on the Kenites , and took up his parable , and said , Strong is THY dwellingplace , and thou puttest THY nest in a rock .
and ships shall come from the coast of Chittim , and shall afflict Asshur , and shall afflict Eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
and Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place : and Balak also went his way .
and Israel abode in Shittim , and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab .
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods : and the people did eat , and bowed down to their gods .
and Israel joined himself unto Baal @-@ peor : and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Take all the heads of the people , and hang them up before the Lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel .
and , behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the Congregation of the children of Israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
and when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the Congregation , and took a javelin in his hand ;
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an Atonement for the children of Israel .
now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
and the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in Midian .
Reuben , the eldest son of Israel : the children of Reuben ; Hanoch , of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites : of Pallu , the family of the Palluites :
these are the families of the Reubenites : and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty .
and the sons of Eliab ; Nemuel , and Dathan , and Abiram . this is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the Congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the Lord :
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
the sons of Simeon after their families : of Nemuel , the family of the Nemuelites : of Jamin , the family of the Jaminites : of Jachin , the family of the Jachinites :
these are the families of the Simeonites , twenty and two thousand and two hundred .

and the sons of Judah after their families were ; of Shelah , the family of the Shelanites : of Pharez , the family of the Pharzites : of Zerah , the family of the Zarhites .
and the sons of Pharez were ; of Hezron , the family of the Hezronites : of Hamul , the family of the Hamulites .
these are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them , threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred .
of the sons of Issachar after their families : of Tola , the family of the Tolaites : of Pua , the family of the Punites :

of the sons of Zebulun after their families : of Sered , the family of the Sardites : of Elon , the family of the Elonites : of Jahleel , the family of the Jahleelites .
these are the families of the Zebulunites according to those that were numbered of them , threescore thousand and five hundred .
of the sons of Manasseh : of Machir , the family of the Machirites : and Machir begat Gilead : of Gilead come the family of the Gileadites .
these are the sons of Gilead : of Jeezer , the family of the Jeezerites : of Helek , the family of the Helekites :
and of Shemida , the family of the Shemidaites : and of Hepher , the family of the Hepherites .
and Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
these are the families of Manasseh , and those that were numbered of them , fifty and two thousand and seven hundred .
these are the sons of Ephraim after their families : of Shuthelah , the family of the Shuthalhites : of Becher , the family of the Bachrites : of Tahan , the family of the Tahanites .
and these are the sons of Shuthelah : of Eran , the family of the Eranites .
these are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them , thirty and two thousand and five hundred . these are the sons of Joseph after their families .
the sons of Benjamin after their families : of Bela , the family of the Belaites : of Ashbel , the family of the Ashbelites : of Ahiram , the family of the Ahiramites :
these are the sons of Benjamin after their families : and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and six hundred .
these are the sons of Dan after their families : of Shuham , the family of the Shuhamites . these are the families of Dan after their families .
all the families of the Shuhamites , according to those that were numbered of them , were threescore and four thousand and four hundred .
of the children of Asher after their families : of Jimna , the family of the Jimnites : of Jesui , the family of the Jesuites : of Beriah , the family of the Beriites .
of the sons of Beriah : of Heber , the family of the Heberites : of Malchiel , the family of the Malchielites .
these are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered of them ; who were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
of the sons of Naphtali after their families : of Jahzeel , the family of the Jahzeelites : of Guni , the family of the Gunites :
of Jezer , the family of the Jezerites : of Shillem , the family of the Shillemites .
these are the families of Naphtali according to their families : and they that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and four hundred .
these were the numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
and these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families : of Gershon , the family of the Gershonites : of Kohath , the family of the Kohathites : of Merari , the family of the Merarites .
these are the families of the Levites : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korathites . and Kohath begat Amram .
and the name of Amram 's wife was Jochebed , the daughter of Levi , whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt : and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses , and Miriam their sister .
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand , all males from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
but among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
the daughters of Zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
and if he have no daughter , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren .
and if he have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father 's brethren .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Get thee up into this mount Abarim , and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel .
and when thou hast seen it , thou also shalt be gathered unto THY people , as Aaron THY brother was gathered .
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin , in the strife of the Congregation , to sanctify me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin .
and Moses spake unto the Lord , saying ,
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the Congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation ; and give him a charge in their sight .
and thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him , that all the Congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient .
and he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of Israel with him , even all the Congregation .
and Moses did as the Lord commanded him : and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the Congregation :
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and thou shalt say unto them , This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the Lord ; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day , for a continual burnt offering .
the one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning , and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even ;
and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering , mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord .
and the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb : in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the Lord for a drink offering .
and on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot , and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , and the drink offering thereof :
and in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord ; two young bullocks , and one ram , seven lambs of the first year without spot ;
and three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one bullock ; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one ram ;
and a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord .
and their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock , and the third part of an hin unto a ram , and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
in the first day shall be an holy convocation ; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein :
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the Lord ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning , which is for a continual burnt offering .
after this manner ye shall offer daily , throughout the seven days , the meat of the sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord : it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work .
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the Lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the Lord ; two young bullocks , one ram , seven lambs of the first year ;
and one kid of the goats , to make an Atonement for you .
Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , ( they shall be unto you without blemish ) and their drink offerings .
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you .
and ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the Lord ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year without blemish :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering , to make an Atonement for you :
and ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall afflict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish :
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals to a bullock , and two tenth deals to one ram ,
and on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work , and ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord seven days :
and ye shall offer a burnt offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord ; thirteen young bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year ; they shall be without blemish :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering thereof , and their drink offerings .
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
on the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly : ye shall do no servile work therein :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the Lord : one bullock , one ram , seven lambs of the first year without blemish :
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock , for the ram , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
these things ye shall do unto the Lord in your set feasts , beside your vows , and your freewill offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meat offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings .
and Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded .
if a man vow a vow unto the Lord , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
if a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father 's house in her youth ;
and her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul , shall stand : and the Lord shall forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
and if she had at all an husband , when she vowed , or uttered ought out of her lips , wherewith she bound her soul ;
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips , wherewith she bound her soul , of none effect : and the Lord shall forgive her .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and disallowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them ; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband hath made them void ; and the Lord shall forgive her .
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establisheth all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confirmeth them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
these are the statutes , which the Lord commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father 's house .
and Moses spake unto the people , saying , ARM some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Midianites , and avenge the Lord of Midian .
of every tribe a thousand , throughout all the tribes of Israel , shall ye send to the war .
so there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
and they warred against the Midianites , as the Lord commanded Moses ; and they slew all the males .
and they slew the kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slain ; namely , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt , and all their goodly castles , with fire .
and they took all the spoil , and all the prey , both of men and of beasts .
and they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and unto the Congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Moab , which are by Jordan near Jericho .
and Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the Congregation , went forth to meet them without the camp .
and Moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Balaam , to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague among the Congregation of the Lord .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
and Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle , This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses ;
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou , and Eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the Congregation :
and divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the Congregation :
and levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
take it of their half , and give it unto Eleazar the priest , for an heave offering of the Lord .
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and thirty and two thousand persons in all , of woman that had not known man by lying with him .
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep :
and the Lord 's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen .
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the Lord 's tribute was threescore and twelve .
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred ; of which the Lord 's tribute was threescore and one .
and the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the Lord 's tribute was thirty and two persons .
and Moses gave the tribute , which was the Lord 's heave offering , unto Eleazar the priest , as the Lord commanded Moses .
and of the children of Israel 's half , which Moses divided from the men that warred ,
( now the half that pertained unto the Congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
even of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the Levites , which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto Moses :
and they said unto Moses , Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
( for the men of war had taken spoil , every man for himself . )
and Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tabernacle of the Congregation , for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .
now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle : and when they saw the land of Jazer , and the land of Gilead , that , behold , the place was a place for cattle ;
Wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in THY sight , let this land be given unto THY servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben , shall your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them ?
for when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them .
and the Lord 's anger was kindled the same time , and he sware , saying ,
and the Lord 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed .
and , behold , ye are risen up in your fathers ' stead , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
we will not return unto our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan , or forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward .
and Moses said unto them , If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the Lord to war ,
and will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord , until he hath driven out his enemies from before him ,
and the land be subdued before the Lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the Lord , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
but if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sinned against the Lord : and be sure your sin will find you out .
and the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses , saying , Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of Gilead :
but THY servants will pass over , every man armed for war , before the Lord to battle , as my lord saith .
so concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun , and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel :
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan .
and the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , As the Lord hath said unto THY servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours .
and Moses gave unto them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , with the cities thereof in the coasts , even the cities of the country round about .
and the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,
and the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elealeh , and Kirjathaim ,
and the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead , and took it , and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it .
and Nobah went and took Kenath , and the villages thereof , and called it Nobah , after his own name .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
and they departed from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians .
for the Egyptians buried all their firstborn , which the Lord had smitten among them : upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments .
and the children of Israel removed from Rameses , and pitched in Succoth .
and they departed from Succoth , and pitched in Etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .
and they removed from Etham , and turned again unto Pi @-@ hahiroth , which is before Baal @-@ zephon : and they pitched before Migdol .
and they departed from before Pi @-@ hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and pitched in Marah .
and they removed from Marah , and came unto Elim : and in Elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there .
and they removed from Elim , and encamped by the Red sea .
and they removed from the Red sea , and encamped in the wilderness of sin .
and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin , and encamped in Dophkah .
and they departed from Dophkah , and encamped in Alush .
and they removed from Alush , and encamped at Rephidim , where was no water for the people to drink .
and they departed from Rephidim , and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai .
and they removed from the desert of Sinai , and pitched at Kibroth @-@ hattaavah .
and they departed from Kibroth @-@ hattaavah , and encamped at Hazeroth .
and they departed from Hazeroth , and pitched in Rithmah .
and they departed from Rithmah , and pitched at Rimmon @-@ parez .
and they departed from Rimmon @-@ parez , and pitched in Libnah .
and they removed from Libnah , and pitched at Rissah .
and they journeyed from Rissah , and pitched in Kehelathah .
and they went from Kehelathah , and pitched in mount Shapher .
and they removed from Haradah , and pitched in Makheloth .
and they removed from Makheloth , and encamped at Tahath .
and they departed from Tahath , and pitched at Tarah .
and they removed from Tarah , and pitched in Mithcah .
and they went from Mithcah , and pitched in Hashmonah .
and they departed from Hashmonah , and encamped at Moseroth .
and they departed from Moseroth , and pitched in Bene @-@ jaakan .
and they departed from Ebronah , and encamped at Ezion @-@ gaber .
and they removed from Ezion @-@ gaber , and pitched in the wilderness of Zin , which is Kadesh .
and they removed from Kadesh , and pitched in mount Hor , in the edge of the land of Edom .
and Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor .
and king Arad the Canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
and they departed from Zalmonah , and pitched in Punon .
and they departed from Punon , and pitched in Oboth .
and they departed from Oboth , and pitched in Ije @-@ abarim , in the border of Moab .
and they departed from Iim , and pitched in Dibon @-@ gad .
and they removed from Almon @-@ diblathaim , and pitched in the mountains of Abarim , before Nebo .
and they departed from the mountains of Abarim , and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
and they pitched by Jordan , from Beth @-@ jesimoth even unto Abel @-@ shittim in the plains of Moab .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan ;
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places :
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for I have given you the land to possess it .
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you ; then it shall come to pass , that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes , and thorns in your sides , and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell .
moreover it shall come to pass , that I shall do unto you , as I thought to do unto them .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof : )
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom , and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward :
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh @-@ barnea , and shall go on to Hazar @-@ addar , and pass on to Azmon :
and the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .
and this shall be your north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor :
from mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad :
and the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar @-@ enan : this shall be your north border .
and the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward :
and the border shall go down to Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the Lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe :
for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers , have received their inheritance ; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance :
the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward , toward the sunrising .
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun .
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe , to divide the land by inheritance .
and the names of the men are these : of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
and of the tribe of the children of Simeon , Shemuel the son of Ammihud .
of the tribe of Benjamin , Elidad the son of Chislon .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan , Bukki the son of Jogli .
the prince of the children of Joseph , for the tribe of the children of Manasseh , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim , Kemuel the son of Shiphtan .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun , Elizaphan the son of Parnach .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher , Ahihud the son of Shelomi .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali , Pedahel the son of Ammihud .
these are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
and the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho , saying ,
command the children of Israel , that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
and the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Levites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about .
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to them ye shall add forty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan ;
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you ; that the Slayer may flee thither , which killeth any person at unawares .
and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger ; that the manslayer die not , until he stand before the Congregation in judgment .
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge .
Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
and if he smite him with throwing a stone , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer : when he meeteth him , he shall slay him .
or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him .
or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
and the Congregation shall deliver the Slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the Congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was anointed with the holy oil .
but if the Slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge , whither he was fled ;
and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge , and the revenger of blood kill the Slayer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the Slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
Whoso killeth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , which is guilty of death : but he shall be surely put to death .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spake before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel :
and they said , The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
and when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord , saying , The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well .
this is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
and every daughter , that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
even as the Lord commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad :
and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the judgments , which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
( there are eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh @-@ barnea . )
and it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them ;
after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei :
on this side Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying ,
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .
and I spake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone :
the Lord your God hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
( the Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you ! )
how can I myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tribes , and I will make them rulers over you .
and ye answered me , and said , The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do .
and I charged your judges at that time , saying , Hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between every man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him .
and I said unto you , Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which the Lord our God doth give unto us .
behold , the Lord THY God hath set the land before thee : go up and possess it , as the Lord God of THY fathers hath said unto thee ; fear not , neither be discouraged .
and they turned and went up into the mountain , and came unto the valley of Eshcol , and searched it out .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us .
and ye murmured in your tents , and said , Because the Lord hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and sware , saying ,
but Joshua the son of nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
but as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
and the Lord said unto me , Say unto them , Go not up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest ye be smitten before your enemies .
so I spake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord , and went presumptuously up into the hill .
and the Amorites , which dwelt in that mountain , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and destroyed you in Seir , even unto Hormah .
and ye returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
so ye abode in Kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode there .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the Lord spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
and the Lord spake unto me , saying ,
and command thou the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau , which dwell in Seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , through the way of the plain from Elath , and from Ezion @-@ gaber , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
the Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ;
for indeed the hand of the Lord was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed .
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
Thou art to pass over through Ar , the coast of Moab , this day :
( that also was accounted a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in old time ; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims ;
a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ; but the Lord destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead :
as he did to the children of Esau , which dwelt in Seir , when he destroyed the Horims from before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead even unto this day :
and the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim , even unto Azzah , the Caphtorims , which came forth out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon : behold , I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
this day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
let me pass through THY land : I will go along by the high way , I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
then Sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at Jahaz .
and the Lord our God delivered him before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
from Aroer , which is by the brink of the river of Arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the Lord our God delivered all unto us :
only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river Jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
and the Lord said unto me , Fear him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into THY hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
so the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
and we took all his cities at that time , there was not a city which we took not from them , threescore cities , all the region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
and we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon , utterly destroying the men , women , and children , of every city .
but all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ;
( which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion ; and the Amorites call it Shenir ; )
all the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salchah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi ; and called them after his own name , Bashan @-@ havoth @-@ jair , unto this day .
and unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river Jabbok , which is the border of the children of Ammon ;
the plain also , and Jordan , and the coast thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under Ashdoth @-@ pisgah eastward .
and I commanded you at that time , saying , The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it : ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel , all that are meet for the war .
and I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings : so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
Ye shall not fear them : for the Lord your God he shall fight for you .
O Lord God , thou hast begun to shew THY servant THY greatness , and THY mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to THY works , and according to THY might ?
but the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me : and the Lord said unto me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
get thee up into the top of Pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes : for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
but charge Joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you .
your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal @-@ peor : for all the men that followed Baal @-@ peor , the Lord THY God hath destroyed them from among you .
but ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day .
behold , I have taught you statutes and judgments , even as the Lord my God commanded me , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
for what nation is there so great , who hath God so nigh unto them , as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for ?
and what nation is there so great , that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law , which I set before you this day ?
only take heed to thyself , and keep THY soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen , and lest they depart from THY heart all the days of THY life : but teach them THY sons , and THY sons ' sons ;
and ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
and he declared unto you his Covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
and the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire :
but the Lord hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God , which he made with you , and make you a Graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the Lord THY God hath forbidden thee .
and the Lord shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the Lord shall lead you .
and there ye shall serve gods , the work of men 's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
but if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord THY God , thou shalt find him , if thou seek him with all THY heart and with all THY soul .
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the Lord THY God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
( for the Lord THY God is a merciful God ; ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the Covenant of THY fathers which he sware unto them .
did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God ; there is none else beside him .
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
and because he loved THY fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ;
to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the Lord he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
that the Slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
namely , Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which Moses spake unto the children of Israel , after they came forth out of Egypt ,
and they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ;
from Aroer , which is by the bank of the river Arnon , even unto mount Sion , which is Hermon ,
and Moses called all Israel , and said unto them , Hear , O Israel , the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
the Lord made not this Covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood between the Lord and you at that time , to shew you the work of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
I am the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
Thou shalt not make thee any Graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth :
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord THY God in vain : for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the Lord THY God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the Lord THY God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
honour THY father and THY mother , as the Lord THY God hath commanded thee ; that THY days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee .
neither shalt thou desire THY neighbour 's wife , neither shalt thou covet THY neighbour 's house , his field , or his manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his ass , or any thing that is THY neighbour 's .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain did burn with fire , ) that ye came near unto me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
and ye said , behold , the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God doth talk with man , and he liveth .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
go thou near , and hear all that the Lord our God shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
and the Lord heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the Lord said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
now these are the commandments , the statutes , and the judgments , which the Lord your God commanded to teach you , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it :
that thou mightest fear the Lord THY God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and THY son , and THY son 's son , all the days of THY life ; and that THY days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the Lord God of THY fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
and thou shalt love the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul , and with all THY might .
and these words , which I command thee this day , shall be in thine heart :
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto THY children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes .
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of THY house , and on THY gates .
then beware lest thou forget the Lord , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
Ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the people which are round about you ;
( for the Lord THY God is a Jealous God among you ) lest the anger of the Lord THY God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God , as ye tempted him in Massah .
Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the Lord sware unto THY fathers ,
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee , as the Lord hath spoken .
and when THY son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What mean the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which the Lord our God hath commanded you ?
then thou shalt say unto THY son , We were Pharaoh 's bondmen in Egypt ; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand :
and the Lord shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
and the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the Lord our God , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
and it shall be our righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God , as he hath commanded us .
and when the Lord THY God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no Covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; THY daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto THY son .
for they will turn away THY son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their Graven images with fire .
for thou art an holy people unto the Lord THY God : the Lord THY God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
the Lord did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
but because the Lord loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
know therefore that the Lord THY God , he is God , the faithful God , which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ;
and repayeth them that hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be Slack to him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which I command thee this day , to do them .
Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the Lord THY God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which he sware unto THY fathers :
Thou shalt be blessed above all people : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your cattle .
and the Lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord THY God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
Thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the Lord THY God did unto Pharaoh , and unto all Egypt ;
moreover the Lord THY God will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
Thou shalt not be affrighted at them : for the Lord THY God is among you , a mighty God and terrible .
and the Lord THY God will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
but the Lord THY God shall deliver them unto thee , and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction , until they be destroyed .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
all the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers .
THY raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did THY foot swell , these forty years .
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so the Lord THY God chasteneth thee .
therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord THY God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
for the Lord THY God bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills ;
a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranates ; a land of oil olive , and honey ;
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass .
when thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt bless the Lord THY God for the good land which he hath given thee .
beware that thou forget not the Lord THY God , in not keeping his commandments , and his judgments , and his statutes , which I command thee this day :
Lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
and when THY herds and THY flocks multiply , and THY silver and THY gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ;
then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the Lord THY God , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage ;
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery Serpents , and Scorpions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of Flint ;
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which THY fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at THY latter end ;
and thou say in thine heart , My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth .
but thou shalt remember the Lord THY God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his Covenant which he sware unto THY fathers , as it is this day .
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the Lord THY God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
as the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God .
a people great and tall , the children of the Anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of Anak !
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the Lord THY God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the Lord .
also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath , so that the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant which the Lord made with you , then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them was written according to all the words , which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the Covenant .
and the Lord said unto me , arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for THY people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image .
furthermore the Lord spake unto me , saying , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under heaven : and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the Covenant were in my two hands .
and I looked , and , behold , ye had sinned against the Lord your God , and had made you a molten calf : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you .
and I took the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you . but the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also .
and the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him : and I prayed for Aaron also the same time .
thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first ; because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
I prayed therefore unto the Lord , and said , O Lord God , destroy not THY people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through THY greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
remember THY servants , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin :
Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say , Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness .
at that time the Lord said unto me , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an Ark of wood .
and I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest , and thou shalt put them in the Ark .
and I made an Ark of shittim wood , and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first , and went up into the mount , having the two tables in mine hand .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the Lord gave them unto me .
and I turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tables in the Ark which I had made ; and there they be , as the Lord commanded me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
from thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah ; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath , a land of rivers of waters .
and I stayed in the mount , according to the first time , forty days and forty nights ; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also , and the Lord would not destroy thee .
and the Lord said unto me , arise , take THY journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
to keep the commandments of the Lord , and his statutes , which I command thee this day for THY good ?
behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord 's THY God , the earth also , with all that therein is .
only the Lord had a delight in THY fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
for the Lord your God is God of gods , and Lord of lords , a great God , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not persons , nor taketh reward :
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow , and loveth the stranger , in giving him food and raiment .
Thou shalt fear the Lord THY God ; him shalt thou serve , and to him shalt thou cleave , and swear by his name .
he is THY praise , and he is THY God , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
therefore thou shalt love the Lord THY God , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his judgments , and his commandments , alway .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
and what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto this day ;
and what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came into this place ;
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did .
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
and that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst THY seed , and wateredst it with THY foot , as a garden of herbs :
but the land , whither ye go to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven :
a land which the Lord THY God careth for : the eyes of the Lord THY God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in THY corn , and THY wine , and thine oil .
and I will send grass in THY fields for THY cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and then the Lord 's wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house , and upon THY gates :
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you , to do them , to love the Lord your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ;
then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves .
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
a blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God , which I command you this day :
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord THY God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the Canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal , beside the plains of Moreh ?
for ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you , and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day .
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the Lord God of THY fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow their altars , and break their pillars , and burn their groves with fire ; and ye shall hew down the Graven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heave offerings of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks :
and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the Lord THY God hath blessed thee .
Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes .
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which the Lord your God giveth you .
but when ye go over Jordan , and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety ;
then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord :
take heed to thyself that thou offer not THY burnt offerings in every place that thou seest :
but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of THY tribes , there thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
Thou mayest not eat within THY gates the tithe of THY corn , or of THY wine , or of THY oil , or the firstlings of THY herds or of THY flock , nor any of THY vows which thou vowest , nor THY freewill offerings , or heave offering of thine hand :
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth .
when the Lord THY God shall enlarge THY border , as he hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , I will eat flesh , because THY soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever THY soul lusteth after .
if the place which the Lord THY God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of THY herd and of THY flock , which the Lord hath given thee , as I have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in THY gates whatsoever THY soul lusteth after .
even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
Thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
Thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with THY children after thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
only THY holy things which thou hast , and THY vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the Lord shall choose :
and thou shalt offer THY burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the Lord THY God : and the blood of THY sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord THY God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
when the Lord THY God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ;
Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord THY God : for every abomination to the Lord , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he spake unto thee , saying , Let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ;
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the Lord your God proveth you , to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
Ye shall walk after the Lord your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cleave unto him .
Thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him :
but thou shalt surely kill him ; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
and all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
then shalt thou inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought among you ;
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord THY God , to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the Lord THY God .
Ye are the children of the Lord your God : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
for thou art an holy people unto the Lord THY God , and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
these are the beasts which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamois .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
and the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh , nor touch their dead carcase .
these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fins and scales shall ye eat :
but these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and ossifrage , and the ospray ,
and the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after his kind ,
and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
and the stork , and the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the BAT .
and every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of THY seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose :
and the Levite that is within THY gates ; thou shalt not forsake him ; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within THY gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the Lord 's release .
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which is thine with THY brother thine hand shall release ;
for the Lord THY God blesseth thee , as he promised thee : and thou shalt lend unto many nations , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nations , but they shall not reign over thee .
if there be among you a poor man of one of THY brethren within any of THY gates in THY land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from THY poor brother :
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
Thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the Lord THY God shall bless thee in all THY works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto THY brother , to THY poor , and to THY needy , in THY land .
and if THY brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
and when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of THY flock , and out of THY floor , and out of THY winepress : of that wherewith the Lord THY God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the Lord THY God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ;
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be THY servant for ever . and also unto THY maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
all the firstling males that come of THY herd and of THY flock thou shalt sanctify unto the Lord THY God : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of THY bullock , nor shear the firstling of THY sheep .
Thou shalt eat it before the Lord THY God year by year in the place which the Lord shall choose , thou and THY household .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord THY God .
only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
observe the month of Abib , and keep the passover unto the Lord THY God : for in the month of Abib the Lord THY God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night .
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord THY God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there .
and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all THY coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of THY gates , which the Lord THY God giveth thee :
but at the place which the Lord THY God shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord THY God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto THY tents .
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord THY God : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the Lord THY God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the Lord THY God , according as the Lord THY God hath blessed thee :
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these statutes .
Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days , after that thou hast gathered in THY corn and THY wine :
and thou shalt rejoice in THY feast , thou , and THY son , and THY daughter , and THY manservant , and THY maidservant , and the Levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are within THY gates .
seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord THY God in the place which the Lord shall choose : because the Lord THY God shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the works of thine hands , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of the Lord THY God which he hath given thee .
judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all THY gates , which the Lord THY God giveth thee , throughout THY tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
Thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect persons , neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
that which is altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and inherit the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee .
Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord THY God , which thou shalt make thee .
neither shalt thou set thee up any image ; which the Lord THY God hateth .
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord THY God any bullock , or sheep , wherein is blemish , or any evilfavouredness : for that is an abomination unto the Lord THY God .
if there be found among you , within any of THY gates which the Lord THY God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the Lord THY God , in transgressing his Covenant ,
and hath gone and served other gods , and worshipped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which I have not commanded ;
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that wicked thing , unto THY gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones , till they die .
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is worthy of death be put to death ; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within THY gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the Lord THY God shall choose ;
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord THY God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
when thou art come unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ;
Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the Lord THY God shall choose : one from among THY brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not THY brother .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
and it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites :
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the Lord his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left : to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his children , in the midst of Israel .
the priests the Levites , and all the tribe of Levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel : they shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire , and his inheritance .
therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren : the Lord is their inheritance , as he hath said unto them .
and this shall be the priest 's due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
the firstfruit also of THY corn , of THY wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the Fleece of THY sheep , shalt thou give him .
for the Lord THY God hath chosen him out of all THY tribes , to stand to minister in the name of the Lord , him and his sons for ever .
and if a Levite come from any of THY gates out of all Israel , where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the Lord shall choose ;
then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God , as all his brethren the Levites do , which stand there before the Lord .
when thou art come into the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord : and because of these abominations the Lord THY God doth drive them out from before thee .
Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord THY God .
for these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the Lord THY God hath not suffered thee so to do .
the Lord THY God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of THY brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord THY God in Horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
and the Lord said unto me , They have well spoken that which they have spoken .
I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren , like unto thee , and will put my words in his mouth ; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
and if thou say in thine heart , How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken ?
when the Lord THY God hath cut off the nations , whose land the Lord THY God giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of THY land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee to possess it .
Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of THY land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every Slayer may flee thither .
and this is the case of the Slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ;
Wherefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt separate three cities for thee .
that innocent blood be not shed in THY land , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
Thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel , that it may go well with thee .
Thou shalt not remove THY neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the Lord THY God giveth thee to possess it .
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the Lord , before the priests and the judges , which shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent Inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and hath testified falsely against his brother ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
and thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the Lord THY God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
and shall say unto them , Hear , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you agginst your enemies , to save you .
and the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart faint as well as his heart .
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
and if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
and when the Lord THY God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
but the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the Lord THY God hath given thee .
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but of the cities of these people , which the Lord THY God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the Lord THY God hath commanded thee :
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the Lord your God .
if one be found slain in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee to possess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hath slain him :
then THY elders and THY judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
and it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer 's neck there in the valley :
and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them the Lord THY God hath chosen to minister unto him , and to bless in the name of the Lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried :
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
be merciful , O Lord , unto THY people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto THY people of Israel 's charge . and the blood shall be forgiven them .
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord .
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies , and the Lord THY God hath delivered them into thine hands , and thou hast taken them captive ,
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto her , that thou wouldest have her to THY wife ;
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
and it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .
if a man have two wives , one beloved , and another hated , and they have born him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated :
then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
Thou shalt not see the brother 's ox or his sheep go astray , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt in any case bring them again unto THY brother .
in like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment ; and with all lost thing of THY brother 's , which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
Thou shalt not see THY brother 's ass or his ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again .
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord THY God .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to thee ; that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong THY days .
when thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a battlement for THY roof , that thou bring not blood upon thine house , if any man fall from thence .
Thou shalt not sow THY vineyard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of THY seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of THY vineyard , be defiled .
Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts , as of woollen and linen together .
Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of THY vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him ;
and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her : then the man only that lay with her shall die :
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
for he found her in the field , and the betrothed damsel cried , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a damsel that is a virgin , which is not betrothed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
he that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord .
a Bastard shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the Congregation of the Lord .
an Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the Congregation of the Lord for ever :
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
nevertheless the Lord THY God would not hearken unto Balaam ; but the Lord THY God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because the Lord THY God loved thee .
Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all THY days for ever .
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite ; for he is THY brother : thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian ; because thou wast a stranger in his land .
the children that are begotten of them shall enter into the Congregation of the Lord in their third generation .
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
but it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
Thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
and thou shalt have a paddle upon THY weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :
for the Lord THY God walketh in the midst of THY camp , to deliver thee , and to give up thine enemies before thee ; therefore shall THY camp be holy : that he see no unclean thing in thee , and turn away from thee .
Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee :
he shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of THY gates , where it liketh him best : thou shalt not oppress him .
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the Lord THY God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the Lord THY God .
Thou shalt not lend upon usury to THY brother ; usury of money , usury of victuals , usury of any thing that is lent upon usury :
unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto THY brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the Lord THY God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
when thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord THY God , thou shalt not Slack to pay it : for the Lord THY God will surely require it of thee ; and it would be sin in thee .
but if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
that which is gone out of THY lips thou shalt keep and perform ; even a freewill offering , according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord THY God , which thou hast promised with THY mouth .
when thou comest into THY neighbour 's vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes THY fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in THY vessel .
when thou comest into the standing corn of THY neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto THY neighbour 's standing corn .
when a man hath taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hath found some uncleanness in her : then let him write her a bill of divorcement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
and when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man 's wife .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the Lord : and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance .
when a man hath taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken .
if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel , and maketh merchandise of him , or selleth him ; then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
remember what the Lord THY God did unto Miriam by the way , after that ye were come forth out of Egypt .
Thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord THY God .
Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of THY brethren , or of THY strangers that are in THY land within THY gates :
at his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and setteth his heart upon it : lest he cry against thee unto the Lord , and it be sin unto thee .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger , nor of the fatherless ; nor take a widow 's raiment to pledge :
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and the Lord THY God redeemed thee thence : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
when thou beatest thine olive tree , thou shalt not go over the boughs again : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
when thou gatherest the grapes of THY vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
if there be a controversy between men , and they come unto judgment , that the judges may judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
forty stripes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then THY brother should seem vile unto thee .
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
and his name shall be called in Israel , The house of him that hath his shoe loosed .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets :
then thou shalt cut off her hand , thine eye shall not pity her .
but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure shalt thou have : that THY days may be lengthened in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee .
for all that do such things , and all that do unrighteously , are an abomination unto the Lord THY God .
remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way , when ye were come forth out of Egypt ;
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
and it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring of THY land that the Lord THY God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place which the Lord THY God shall choose to place his name there .
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto the Lord THY God , that I am come unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for to give us .
and the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the Lord THY God .
and the Egyptians evil entreated us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage :
and when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers , the Lord heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
and the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders :
and he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O Lord , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the Lord THY God , and worship before the Lord THY God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord THY God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
look down from THY holy habitation , from heaven , and bless THY people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
this day the Lord THY God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all THY soul .
Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be THY God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice :
and the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments ;
and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the Lord THY God , as he hath spoken .
and Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people , saying , keep all the commandments which I command you this day .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaister them with plaister .
and there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lord THY God , an altar of stones : thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord THY God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord THY God :
and thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the Lord THY God .
Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord THY God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
these shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
and the Levites shall speak , and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice ,
Cursed be he that lieth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the Lord THY God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
and all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God .
blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .
blessed shall be the fruit of THY body , and the fruit of THY ground , and the fruit of THY cattle , the increase of THY kine , and the flocks of THY sheep .
blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before THY face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in THY storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord THY God giveth thee .
the Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord THY God , and walk in his ways .
and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
Cursed shalt thou be in the city , and Cursed shalt thou be in the field .
Cursed shall be the fruit of THY body , and the fruit of THY land , the increase of THY kine , and the flocks of THY sheep .
Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and Cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
the Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
the Lord shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with an inflammation , and with an extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blasting , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
and THY heaven that is over THY head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
the Lord shall make the rain of THY land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
the Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
and THY carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air , and unto the beasts of the earth , and no man shall fray them away .
the Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .
the Lord shall smite thee with madness , and blindness , and astonishment of heart :
and thou shalt grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness , and thou shalt not prosper in THY ways : and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore , and no man shall save thee .
Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before THY face , and shall not be restored to thee : THY sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
THY sons and THY daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
the fruit of THY land , and all THY labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
the Lord shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of THY foot unto the top of THY head .
the Lord shall bring thee , and THY king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor THY fathers have known ; and there shalt thou serve other gods , wood and stone .
and thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee .
Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
Thou shalt plant vineyards , and dress them , but shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grapes ; for the worms shall eat them .
Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all THY coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
Thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into captivity .
the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high ; and thou shalt come down very low .
he shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
because thou servedst not the Lord THY God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things ;
and he shall besiege thee in all THY gates , until THY high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all THY land : and he shall besiege thee in all THY gates throughout all THY land , which the Lord THY God hath given thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of THY sons and of THY daughters , which the Lord THY God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all THY gates .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the Lord THY God ;
then the Lord will make THY plagues wonderful , and the plagues of THY seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and sore sicknesses , and of long continuance .
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the Lord bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord THY God .
and it shall come to pass , that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
and the Lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor THY fathers have known , even wood and stone .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of THY foot have rest : but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
and THY life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of THY life :
in the morning thou shalt say , Would God it were even ! and at even thou shalt say , Would God it were morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
these are the words of the Covenant , which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab , beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , unto this day .
and I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and THY shoe is not waxen old upon THY foot .
and when ye came unto this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us unto battle , and we smote them :
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half tribe of Manasseh .
keep therefore the words of this Covenant , and do them , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
that thou shouldest enter into Covenant with the Lord THY God , and into his oath , which the Lord THY God maketh with thee this day :
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a God , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto THY fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
neither with you only do I make this Covenant and this oath ;
( for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt ; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by ;
and ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them : )
and the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the Covenant that are written in this book of the law :
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses which the Lord hath laid upon it ;
then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
for they went and served other gods , and worshipped them , gods whom they knew not , and whom he had not given unto them :
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book :
and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
the secret things belong unto the Lord our God : but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever , that we may do all the words of this law .
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the Lord THY God hath driven thee ,
and shalt return unto the Lord THY God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and THY children , with all thine heart , and with all THY soul ;
that then the Lord THY God will turn THY captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whither the Lord THY God hath scattered thee .
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the Lord THY God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and the Lord THY God will bring thee into the land which THY fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above THY fathers .
and the Lord THY God will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of THY seed , to love the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul , that thou mayest live .
and the Lord THY God will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord , and do all his commandments which I command thee this day .
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord THY God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the Lord THY God with all thine heart , and with all THY soul .
it is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word is very nigh unto thee , in THY mouth , and in THY heart , that thou mayest do it .
see , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
but if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
I denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land , whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it .
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the Lord hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
the Lord THY God , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possess them : and Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the Lord hath said .
and the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og , kings of the Amorites , and unto the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and the Lord shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the Lord THY God , he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and the Lord , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and unto all the elders of Israel .
and Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacles ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord THY God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and THY stranger that is within THY gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the Lord your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and that their children , which have not known any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the Lord your God , as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
and the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud : and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle .
and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other gods , and serve them , and provoke me , and break my Covenant .
Moses therefore wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of Israel .
and he gave Joshua the son of nun a charge , and said , Be strong and of a good courage : for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them : and I will be with thee .
and it came to pass , when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
that Moses commanded the Levites , which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , saying ,
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , that it may be there for a witness against thee .
for I know THY rebellion , and THY stiff neck : behold , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebellious against the Lord ; and how much more after my death ?
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
and Moses spake in the ears of all the Congregation of Israel the words of this song , until they were ended .
give ear , O ye heavens , and I will speak ; and hear , O earth , the words of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
because I will publish the name of the Lord : ascribe ye greatness unto our God .
he is the Rock , his work is perfect : for all his ways are judgment : a God of truth and without iniquity , just and right is he .
do ye thus requite the Lord , O foolish people and unwise ? is not he THY father that hath bought thee ? hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations : ask THY father , and he will shew thee ; THY elders , and they will tell thee .
when the most High divided to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the sons of Adam , he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel .
for the Lord 's portion is his people ; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
he found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
so the Lord alone did lead him , and there was no strange god with him .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
but Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods , with abominations provoked they him to anger .
they sacrificed unto devils , not to God ; to gods whom they knew not , to new gods that came newly up , whom your fathers feared not .
of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful , and hast forgotten God that formed thee .
and when the Lord saw it , he abhorred them , because of the provoking of his sons , and of his daughters .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities : and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people ; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
for a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
they shall be burnt with hunger , and devoured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction : I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the poison of Serpents of the dust .
the sword without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hairs .
I said , I would scatter them into corners , I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men :
for they are a nation void of counsel , neither is there any understanding in them .
O that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
for their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter :
their wine is the poison of dragons , and the cruel venom of asps .
to me belongeth vengeance , and recompence ; their foot shall slide in due time : for the day of their calamity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make haste .
for the Lord shall judge his people , and repent himself for his servants , when he seeth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
if I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy .
rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will avenge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be merciful unto his land , and to his people .
and Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hoshea the son of nun .
for it is not a vain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land , whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto THY people ; as Aaron THY brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people :
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah @-@ Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
and this is the blessing , wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
Yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in THY hand : and they sat down at THY feet ; every one shall receive of THY words .
and of Levi he said , Let THY Thummim and THY Urim be with THY holy one , whom thou didst prove at Massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah ;
who said unto his father and to his mother , I have not seen him ; neither did he acknowledge his brethren , nor knew his own children : for they have observed THY word , and kept THY Covenant .
they shall teach Jacob THY judgments , and Israel THY law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
and of Benjamin he said , The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him ; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long , and he shall dwell between his shoulders .
and of Joseph he said , blessed of the Lord be his land , for the precious things of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun , and for the precious things put forth by the moon ,
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains , and for the precious things of the lasting hills ,
and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
and of Gad he said , blessed be he that enlargeth Gad : he dwelleth as a lion , and teareth the arm with the crown of the head .
there is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in THY help , and in his excellency on the sky .
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
and Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho . and the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead , unto Dan ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of Jericho , the city of palm trees , unto Zoar .
and the Lord said unto him , This is the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto THY seed : I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
so Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord .
and he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab , over against Beth @-@ peor : but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day .
and Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
and the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days : so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended .
and Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hearkened unto him , and did as the Lord commanded Moses .
and there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses , whom the Lord knew face to face ,
in all the signs and the wonders , which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel .
now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass , that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun , Moses ' minister , saying ,
Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of THY life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give them .
this book of the law shall not depart out of THY mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make THY way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
have not I commanded thee ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the Lord THY God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
and to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to half the tribe of Manasseh , spake Joshua , saying ,
remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , saying , The Lord your God hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
according as we hearkened unto Moses in all things , so will we hearken unto thee : only the Lord THY God be with thee , as he was with Moses .
Whosoever he be that doth rebel against THY commandment , and will not hearken unto THY words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and it was told the king of Jericho , saying , behold , there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country .
and the woman took the two men , and hid them , and said thus , There came men unto me , but I wist not whence they were :
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
and before they were laid down , she came up unto them upon the roof ;
and she said unto the men , I know that the Lord hath given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house was upon the town wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
and she said unto them , Get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
and the men said unto her , We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear .
behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by : and thou shalt bring THY father , and THY mother , and THY brethren , and all THY father 's household , home unto thee .
and if thou utter this our business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
and she said , According unto your words , so be it . and she sent them away , and they departed : and she bound the scarlet line in the window .
and they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
so the two men returned , and descended from the mountain , and passed over , and came to Joshua the son of nun , and told him all things that befell them :
and Joshua rose early in the morning ; and they removed from Shittim , and came to Jordan , he and all the children of Israel , and lodged there before they passed over .
and it came to pass after three days , that the officers went through the host ;
and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Joshua spake unto the priests , saying , Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the Ark of the Covenant , and went before the people .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua said , Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
behold , the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan .
and it came to pass , when the people removed from their tents , to pass over Jordan , and the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people ;
and as they that bare the Ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the Ark were dipped in the brim of the water , ( for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over Jordan , that the Lord spake unto Joshua , saying ,
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man :
that this may be a sign among you , that when your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , What mean ye by these stones ?
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the Ark of the Covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the Ark of the Lord passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
and the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spake unto them :
about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord unto battle , to the plains of Jericho .
on that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
and it came to pass , when the priests that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan , and the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up unto the dry land , that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place , and flowed over all his banks , as they did before .
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , in the east border of Jericho .
and those twelve stones , which they took out of Jordan , did Joshua pitch in Gilgal .
and he spake unto the children of Israel , saying , When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , What mean these stones ?
then ye shall let your children know , saying , Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
for the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the Lord your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
and Joshua made him sharp knives , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins .
and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised : for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them by the way .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and the Lord said unto Joshua , This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day .
and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho .
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
and the captain of the Lord 's host said unto Joshua , Loose THY shoe from off THY foot ; for the place whereon thou standest is holy . and Joshua did so .
now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel : none went out , and none came in .
and the Lord said unto Joshua , See , I have given into thine hand Jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty men of valour .
and ye shall compass the city , all ye men of war , and go round about the city once . thus shalt thou do six days .
and seven priests shall bear before the Ark seven trumpets of rams ' horns : and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times , and the priests shall blow with the trumpets .
and Joshua the son of nun called the priests , and said unto them , Take up the Ark of the Covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the Ark of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when Joshua had spoken unto the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns passed on before the Lord , and blew with the trumpets : and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them .
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets , and the rereward came after the Ark , the priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets .
so the Ark of the Lord compassed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
and Joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the Ark of the Lord .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , Joshua said unto the people , shout ; for the Lord hath given you the city .
and the city shall be accursed , even it , and all that are therein , to the Lord : only Rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselves accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of Israel a curse , and trouble it .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated unto the Lord : they shall come into the treasury of the Lord .
and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
but Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country , Go into the harlot 's house , and bring out thence the woman , and all that she hath , as ye sware unto her .
and the young men that were spies went in , and brought Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred , and left them without the camp of Israel .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord .
and Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father 's household , and all that she had ; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day ; because she hid the messengers , which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing : for Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , took of the accursed thing : and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel .
and Joshua sent men from Jericho to AI , which is beside Beth @-@ aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed AI .
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men : and they fled before the men of AI .
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the eventide , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
and Joshua said , Alas , O Lord God , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? would to God we had been content , and dwelt on the other side Jordan !
and it shall be , that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he hath : because he hath transgressed the Covenant of the Lord , and because he hath wrought Folly in Israel .
so Joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought Israel by their tribes ; and the tribe of Judah was taken :
and he brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
so Joshua sent messengers , and they ran unto the tent ; and , behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
and they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto Joshua , and unto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the Lord .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against AI : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
and he commanded them , saying , behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
then ye shall rise up from the ambush , and seize upon the city : for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do . see , I have commanded you .
Joshua therefore sent them forth : and they went to lie in ambush , and abode between Bethel and AI , on the west side of AI : but Joshua lodged that night among the people .
and Joshua rose up early in the morning , and numbered the people , and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to AI .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the north side of AI : now there was a valley between them and AI .
and he took about five thousand men , and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and AI , on the west side of the city .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
and all the people that were in AI were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and there was not a man left in AI or Bethel , that went not out after Israel : and they left the city open , and pursued after Israel .
and the Lord said unto Joshua , Stretch out the spear that is in THY hand toward AI ; for I will give it into thine hand . and Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and slew the men of AI .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smote them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of AI in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned unto AI , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
and so it was , that all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of AI .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of AI .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the Lord which he commanded Joshua .
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
and afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessings and cursings , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
and when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to AI ,
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and old shoes and clouted upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy .
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and they said unto him , From a very far country THY servants are come because of the name of the Lord THY God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites , that were beyond Jordan , to Sihon king of Heshbon , and to Og king of Bashan , which was at Ashtaroth .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the men took of their victuals , and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord .
and Joshua made peace with them , and made a league with them , to let them live : and the princes of the Congregation sware unto them .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
and the children of Israel journeyed , and came unto their cities on the third day . now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjath @-@ jearim .
and the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the Congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel . and all the Congregation murmured against the princes .
but all the princes said unto all the Congregation , We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
this we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
and Joshua called for them , and he spake unto them , saying , Wherefore have ye beguiled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye dwell among us ?
now therefore ye are Cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and Drawers of water for the house of my God .
and now , behold , we are in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us , do .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
that they feared greatly , because Gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than AI , and all the men thereof were mighty .
Wherefore Adoni @-@ zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron , and unto Piram king of Jarmuth , and unto Japhia king of Lachish , and unto Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
therefore the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before Gibeon , and made war against it .
so Joshua ascended from Gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valour .
and the Lord discomfited them before Israel , and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth @-@ horon , and smote them to Azekah , and unto Makkedah .
and there was no day like that before it or after it , that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man : for the Lord fought for Israel .
and Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , unto the camp to Gilgal .
but these five kings fled , and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah .
and stay ye not , but pursue after your enemies , and smite the hindmost of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand .
and it came to pass , when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon .
and Joshua said unto them , Fear not , nor be dismayed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
and afterward Joshua smote them , and slew them , and hanged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and that day Joshua took Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho .
then Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , unto Libnah , and fought against Libnah :
and Joshua passed from Libnah , and all Israel with him , unto Lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it :
and the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
and from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon , and all Israel with him ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it :
and they took it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
and Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , unto Hebron ; and they fought against it :
and they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and all the souls that were therein .
and Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to Debir ; and fought against it :
and Joshua smote them from Kadesh @-@ barnea even unto Gaza , and all the country of Goshen , even unto Gibeon .
and it came to pass , when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , and to the king of Achshaph ,
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west ,
and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
and when all these kings were met together , they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom , to fight against Israel .
and the Lord said unto Joshua , Be not afraid because of them : for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel : thou shalt hough their horses , and burn their chariots with fire .
so Joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly ; and they fell upon them .
and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel , who smote them , and chased them unto great Zidon , and unto Misrephoth @-@ maim , and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward ; and they smote them , until they left them none remaining .
and Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him : he houghed their horses , and burnt their chariots with fire .
and Joshua at that time turned back , and took Hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword : for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms .
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe : and he burnt Hazor with fire .
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did Joshua take , and smote them with the edge of the sword , and he utterly destroyed them , as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded .
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Hazor only ; that did Joshua burn .
and all the spoil of these cities , and the cattle , the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves ; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to breathe .
as the Lord commanded Moses his servant , so did Moses command Joshua , and so did Joshua ; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon : all other they took in battle .
for it was of the Lord to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the Lord commanded Moses .
there was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the Lord said unto Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . and the land rested from war .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon , and all the plain on the east :
and the coast of Og king of Bashan , which was of the remnant of the giants , that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
and reigned in mount Hermon , and in Salcah , and in all Bashan , unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites , and half Gilead , the border of Sihon king of Heshbon .
them did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
the king of Jericho , one ; the king of AI , which is beside Bethel , one ;
the king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ;
the king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ;
the king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ;
the king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ;
the king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ;
the king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ;
the king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ;
the king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lasharon , one ;
the king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ;
the king of Shimron @-@ Meron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ;
the king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ;
the king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam of Carmel , one ;
the king of Dor in the coast of Dor , one ; the king of the nations of Gilgal , one ;
this is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the Philistines , and all Geshuri ,
from the south , all the land of the Canaanites , and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians , unto Aphek , to the borders of the Amorites :
and the land of the Giblites , and all Lebanon , toward the sunrising , from Baal @-@ gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath .
with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them ;
from Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ;
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ;
and Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and all mount Hermon , and all Bashan unto Salcah ;
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites , nor the Maachathites : but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day .
only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance ; the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance , as he said unto them .
and Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families .
and their coast was from Aroer , that is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Medeba ;
Heshbon , and all her cities that are in the plain ; Dibon , and Bamoth @-@ baal , and Beth @-@ baal @-@ meon ,
and Beth @-@ peor , and Ashdoth @-@ pisgah , and Beth @-@ jeshimoth ,
Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them .
and the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan , and the border thereof . this was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
and Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad , even unto the children of Gad according to their families .
and their coast was Jazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , unto Aroer that is before Rabbah ;
and from Heshbon unto Ramath @-@ mizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir ;
this is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families , the cities , and their villages .
and Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families .
and their coast was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , and all the towns of Jair , which are in Bashan , threescore cities :
and half Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families .
these are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab , on the other side Jordan , by Jericho , eastward .
and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
by lot was their inheritance , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half tribe .
for Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them .
as the Lord commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did , and they divided the land .
forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh @-@ barnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
and now , behold , the Lord hath kept me alive , as he said , these forty and five years , even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses , while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness : and now , lo , I am this day fourscore and five years old .
as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day , because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward :
and it went out to the south side to Maaleh @-@ acrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh @-@ barnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and fetched a compass to Karkaa :
from thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
and the border went up to Beth @-@ hogla , and passed along by the north of Beth @-@ arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben :
and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of En @-@ shemesh , and the goings out thereof were at En @-@ rogel :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast thereof . this is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families .
and Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath @-@ sepher .
and Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , took it : and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife .
and it came to pass , as she came unto him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she lighted off her ass ; and Caleb said unto her , What wouldest thou ?
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel , and Eder , and Jagur ,
and Lebaoth , and Shilhim , and Ain , and Rimmon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages :
from Ekron even unto the sea , all that lay near Ashdod , with their villages :
Ashdod with her towns and her villages , Gaza with her towns and her villages , unto the river of Egypt , and the great sea , and the border thereof :
and Humtah , and Kirjath @-@ arba , which is Hebron , and Zior ; nine cities with their villages :
and Maarath , and Beth @-@ anoth , and Eltekon ; six cities with their villages :
in the wilderness , Beth @-@ arabah , Middin , and Secacah ,
and Nibshan , and the city of Salt , and En @-@ gedi ; six cities with their villages .
as for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out : but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho , unto the water of Jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel ,
and goeth out from Bethel to Luz , and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth ,
and goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti , unto the coast of Beth @-@ horon the nether , and to Gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth @-@ addar , unto Beth @-@ horon the upper ;
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
and it went down from Janohah to Ataroth , and to Naarath , and came to Jericho , and went out at Jordan .
the border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families .
and the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
there was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of Joseph ; to wit , for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families ; for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families .
but Zelophehad , the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mahlah , and Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
and there fell ten portions to Manasseh , beside the land of Gilead and Bashan , which were on the other side Jordan ;
and the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah , that lieth before Shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En @-@ tappuah .
now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah : but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim ;
and the coast descended unto the river Kanah , southward of the river : these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh : the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and the outgoings of it were at the sea :
southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in Asher on the north , and in Issachar on the east .
and Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth @-@ shean and her towns , and Ibleam and her towns , and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns , and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns , and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns , even three countries .
yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute ; but did not utterly drive them out .
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh , and set up the tabernacle of the Congregation there . and the land was subdued before them .
and there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes , which had not yet received their inheritance .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the description hither to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God .
and the men went and passed through the land , and described it by cities into seven parts in a book , and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh .
and Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord : and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph .
and their border on the north side was from Jordan ; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth @-@ aven .
and the border went over from thence toward Luz , to the side of Luz , which is Bethel , southward ; and the border descended to Ataroth @-@ adar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth @-@ horon .
and the border was drawn thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before Beth @-@ horon southward ; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath @-@ baal , which is Kirjath @-@ jearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .
and the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath @-@ jearim , and the border went out on the west , and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah :
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
and passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward , and went down unto Arabah :
and the border passed along to the side of Beth @-@ hoglah northward : and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan : this was the south coast .
and Jordan was the border of it on the east side . this was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , by the coasts thereof round about , according to their families .
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Beth @-@ hoglah , and the valley of Keziz ,
and Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and the second lot came forth to Simeon , even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families : and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath @-@ beer , Ramath of the south . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families .
out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon : for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them : therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families : and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid :
and their border went up toward the sea , and Maralah , and reached to Dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before Jokneam ;
and turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth @-@ tabor , and then goeth out to daberath , and goeth up to Japhia ,
and from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah @-@ hepher , to Ittah @-@ kazin , and goeth out to Remmon @-@ methoar to Neah ;
and the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon : and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah @-@ el :
this is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and the fourth lot came out to Issachar , for the children of Issachar according to their families .
and the coast reacheth to Tabor , and Shahazimah , and Beth @-@ shemesh ; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families .
and Alammelech , and Amad , and Misheal ; and reacheth to Carmel westward , and to Shihor @-@ libnath ;
and turneth toward the sunrising to Beth @-@ dagon , and reacheth to Zebulun , and to the valley of Jiphthah @-@ el toward the north side of Beth @-@ Emek , and Neiel , and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand ,
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali , even for the children of Naphtali according to their families .
and their coast was from Heleph , from Allon to Zaanannim , and Adami , Nekeb , and Jabneel , unto Lakum ; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan :
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
when they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts , the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of nun among them :
according to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he asked , even Timnath @-@ serah in mount Ephraim : and he built the city , and dwelt therein .
the Lord also spake unto Joshua , saying ,
and if the avenger of blood pursue after him , then they shall not deliver the Slayer up into his hand ; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly , and hated him not beforetime .
and they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali , and Shechem in mount Ephraim , and Kirjath @-@ arba , which is Hebron , in the mountain of Judah .
and the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the Lord , these cities and their suburbs .
and the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites : and the children of Aaron the priest , which were of the Levites , had by lot out of the tribe of Judah , and out of the tribe of Simeon , and out of the tribe of Benjamin , thirteen cities .
and the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
and the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
the children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben , and out of the tribe of Gad , and out of the tribe of Zebulun , twelve cities .
and the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs , as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses .
and they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had : for theirs was the first lot .
and they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak , which city is Hebron , in the hill country of Judah , with the suburbs thereof round about it .
but the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession .
thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Libnah with her suburbs ,
and Jattir with her suburbs , and Eshtemoa with her suburbs ,
and Ain with her suburbs , and Juttah with her suburbs , and Beth @-@ shemesh with her suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
and out of the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon with her suburbs , Geba with her suburbs ,
and the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
for they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Gezer with her suburbs ,
and Kibzaim with her suburbs , and Beth @-@ horon with her suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , Tanach with her suburbs , and Gath @-@ rimmon with her suburbs ; two cities .
and unto the children of Gershon , of the families of the Levites , out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Beesh @-@ terah with her suburbs ; two cities .
and out of the tribe of Naphtali , Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the Slayer ; and Hammoth @-@ dor with her suburbs , and Kartan with her suburbs ; three cities .
and unto the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with her suburbs , and Kartah with her suburbs ,
so all the cities for the children of Merari by their families , which were remaining of the families of the Levites , were by their lot twelve cities .
all the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs .
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them : thus were all these cities .
and the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers ; and they possessed it , and dwelt therein .
and the Lord gave them rest round about , according to all that he sware unto their fathers : and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand .
there failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel ; all came to pass .
and said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the Lord your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away : and they went unto their tents .
now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
and when they came unto the borders of Jordan , that are in the land of Canaan , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan , a great altar to see to .
and the children of Israel heard say , behold , the chidren of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan , in the borders of Jordan , at the passage of the children of Israel .
and when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
and the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
and with him ten princes , of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel .
and they came unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , unto the land of Gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
thus saith the whole Congregation of the Lord , What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have builded you an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the Congregation of the Lord ,
but that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord ? and it will be , seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole Congregation of Israel .
did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing , and wrath fell on all the Congregation of Israel ? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity .
then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered , and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the Lord himself require it ;
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel ?
for the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Reuben and children of Gad ; ye have no part in the Lord : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord .
and when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the Congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , unto the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
and it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age .
and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the Lord your God is he that hath fought for you .
and the Lord your God , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the Lord your God hath promised unto you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
for the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand : for the Lord your God , he it is that fighteth for you , as he hath promised you .
take good heed therefore unto yourselves , that ye love the Lord your God .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them : and afterward I brought you out .
and I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and ye came unto the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea .
and when they cried unto the Lord , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
and I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
then Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and warred against Israel , and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you :
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and I sent the hornet before you , which drave them out from before you , even the two kings of the Amorites ; but not with THY sword , nor with THY bow .
and the Lord drave out from before us all the people , even the Amorites which dwelt in the land : therefore will we also serve the Lord ; for he is our God .
and Joshua said unto the people , Ye cannot serve the Lord : for he is an holy God ; he is a Jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
now therefore put away , said he , the strange gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel .
and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the Lord .
and Joshua said unto all the people , behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God .
and it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath @-@ serah , which is in mount Ephraim , on the north side of the hill of Gaash .
and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the Lord , that he had done for Israel .
and Eleazar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son , which was given him in mount Ephraim .
now after the death of Joshua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying , Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
and Judah went up ; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand : and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men .
and they found Adoni @-@ bezek in Bezek : and they fought against him , and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
but Adoni @-@ bezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron : ( now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath @-@ arba : ) and they slew Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai .
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir : and the name of Debir before was Kirjath @-@ sepher :
and it came to pass , when she came to him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she lighted from off her ass ; and Caleb said unto her , What wilt thou ?
and the children of the Kenite , Moses ' father in law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which lieth in the south of Arad ; and they went and dwelt among the people .
and Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it . and the name of the city was called Hormah .
also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof , and Askelon with the coast thereof , and Ekron with the coast thereof .
and the Lord was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
and they gave Hebron unto Caleb , as Moses said : and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak .
and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day .
and the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel : and the Lord was with them .
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
and the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called the name thereof Luz : which is the name thereof unto this day .
neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shean and her towns , nor Taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns : but the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them .
neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho , nor the inhabitants of Zidon , nor of Ahlab , nor of Achzib , nor of Helbah , nor of Aphik , nor of Rehob :
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth @-@ anath ; but he dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth @-@ shemesh and of Beth @-@ anath became tributaries unto them .
and the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain : for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley :
but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon , and in Shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became tributaries .
and the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
and an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim , and said , I made you to go up out of Egypt , and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers ; and I said , I will never break my Covenant with you .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ?
Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
and it came to pass , when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and they called the name of that place Bochim : and they sacrificed there unto the Lord .
and when Joshua had let the people go , the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land .
and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel .
and Joshua the son of nun , the servant of the Lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath @-@ heres , in the mount of Ephraim , on the north side of the hill Gaash .
and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , which knew not the Lord , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim :
and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the Lord to anger .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
Whithersoever they went out , the hand of the Lord was against them for evil , as the Lord had said , and as the Lord had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
nevertheless the Lord raised up judges , which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them .
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel ; and he said , Because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers , and have not hearkened unto my voice ;
I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died :
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
therefore the Lord left those nations , without driving them out hastily ; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua .
namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal @-@ hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
and they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
and the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites , Hittites , and Amorites , and Perizzites , and Hivites , and Jebusites :
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and forgat the Lord their God , and served Baalim and the groves .
therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia : and the children of Israel served Chushan @-@ rishathaim eight years .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the Lord delivered Chushan @-@ rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan @-@ rishathaim .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
and he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliverer , Ehud the son of Gera , a Benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab .
but Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
and he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab : and Eglon was a very fat man .
and when he had made an end to offer the present , he sent away the people that bare the present .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly :
and the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
then Ehud went forth through the porch , and shut the doors of the parlour upon him , and locked them .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
and they tarried till they were ashamed : and , behold , he opened not the doors of the parlour ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
and Ehud escaped while they tarried , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped unto Seirath .
and it came to pass , when he was come , that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
and they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
so Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . and the land had rest fourscore years .
and the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord , when Ehud was dead .
and the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , that reigned in Hazor ; the captain of whose host was Sisera , which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles .
and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
and she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
and I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera , the captain of Jabin 's army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into thine hand .
and Barak said unto her , If thou wilt go with me , then I will go : but if thou wilt not go with me , then I will not go .
and Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh ; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet : and Deborah went up with him .
now Heber the Kenite , which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses , had severed himself from the Kenites , and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim , which is by Kedesh .
and they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
and the Lord discomfited Sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
but Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the host , unto Harosheth of the Gentiles : and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left .
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite : for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
and Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
and he said unto her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
again he said unto her , Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and inquire of thee , and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No .
and , behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael came out to meet him , and said unto him , Come , and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest . and when he came into her tent , behold , Sisera lay dead , and the nail was in his temples .
and the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
hear , O ye kings ; give ear , O ye princes ; I , even I , will sing unto the Lord ; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel .
Lord , when thou wentest out of Seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
the mountains melted from before the Lord , even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel .
in the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travellers walked through byways .
my heart is toward the governors of Israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . bless ye the Lord .
speak , ye that ride on white asses , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way .
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel : then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates .
awake , awake , Deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , Barak , and lead THY captivity captive , thou son of Abinoam .
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people : the Lord made me have dominion over the mighty .
out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek ; after thee , Benjamin , among THY people ; out of Machir came down governors , and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
why abodest thou among the sheepfolds , to hear the bleatings of the flocks ? for the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart .
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field .
the kings came and fought , then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo ; they took no gain of money .
the river of Kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river Kishon . O my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings , the pransings of their mighty ones .
curse ye Meroz , said the angel of the Lord , curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the Lord , to the help of the Lord against the mighty .
blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be , blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
she put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen 's hammer ; and with the hammer she smote Sisera , she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
the mother of Sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice , Why is his chariot so long in coming ? why tarry the wheels of his chariots ?
so let all thine enemies perish , O Lord : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might . and the land had rest forty years .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
and so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
for they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as grasshoppers for multitude ; for both they and their camels were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites ; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord .
and it came to pass , when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites ,
that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and I said unto you , I am the Lord your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
and there came an angel of the Lord , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah , that pertained unto Joash the Abi @-@ ezrite : and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the Midianites .
and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him , and said unto him , The Lord is with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
and the Lord looked upon him , and said , Go in this THY might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites : have not I sent thee ?
and he said unto him , If now I have found grace in THY sight , then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me .
depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
and Gideon went in , and made ready a kid , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out unto him under the oak , and presented it .
and the angel of God said unto him , Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth . and he did so .
and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord , Gideon said , Alas , O Lord God ! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face .
and build an altar unto the Lord THY God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the Lord had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father 's household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was cast down , and the grove was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
and they said one to another , Who hath done this thing ? and when they inquired and asked , they said , Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing .
then the men of the city said unto Joash , Bring out THY son , that he may die : because he hath cast down the altar of Baal , and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it .
then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pitched in the valley of Jezreel .
but the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and Abi @-@ ezer was gathered after him .
and he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto Asher , and unto Zebulun , and unto Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
behold , I will put a Fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the Fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
and it was so : for he rose up early on the morrow , and thrust the Fleece together , and wringed the dew out of the Fleece , a bowl full of water .
and God did so that night : for it was dry upon the Fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
then Jerubbaal , who is Gideon , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pitched beside the well of Harod : so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them , by the hill of Moreh , in the valley .
and the Lord said unto Gideon , The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands , lest Israel vaunt themselves against me , saying , Mine own hand hath saved me .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gilead . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
so he brought down the people unto the water : and the Lord said unto Gideon , Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue , as a dog lappeth , him shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink .
and the number of them that lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , were three hundred men : but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water .
and the Lord said unto Gideon , By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you , and deliver the Midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
and it came to pass the same night , that the Lord said unto him , arise , get thee down unto the host ; for I have delivered it into thine hand .
but if thou fear to go down , go thou with Phurah THY servant down to the host :
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and his fellow answered and said , This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , a man of Israel : for into his hand hath God delivered Midian , and all the host .
and it was so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream , and the interpretation thereof , that he worshipped , and returned into the host of Israel , and said , arise ; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
when I blow with a trumpet , I and all that are with me , then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and say , The sword of the Lord , and of Gideon .
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp : and all the host ran , and cried , and fled .
and the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the Lord set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Beth @-@ shittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abel @-@ meholah , unto Tabbath .
and the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after the Midianites .
and the men of Ephraim said unto him , Why hast thou served us thus , that thou calledst us not , when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites ? and they did chide with him sharply .
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb : and what was I able to do in comparison of you ? then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
and Gideon came to Jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing them .
and he said unto the men of Succoth , Give , I pray you , loaves of bread unto the people that follow me ; for they be faint , and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian .
and the princes of Succoth said , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
and he went up thence to Penuel , and spake unto them likewise : and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him .
and he spake also unto the men of Penuel , saying , When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower .
now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
and Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and smote the host : for the host was secure .
and when Zebah and Zalmunna fled , he pursued after them , and took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and discomfited all the host .
and Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up ,
and caught a young man of the men of Succoth , and inquired of him : and he described unto him the princes of Succoth , and the elders thereof , even threescore and seventeen men .
and he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
and he beat down the tower of Penuel , and slew the men of the city .
then the men of Israel said unto Gideon , Rule thou over us , both thou , and THY son , and THY son 's son also : for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian .
and Gideon said unto them , I would desire a request of you , that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey . ( for they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites . )
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten : for he had many wives .
and Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abi @-@ ezrites .
and it came to pass , as soon as Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a whoring after Baalim , and made Baal @-@ berith their god .
and the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , namely , Gideon , according to all the Goodness which he had shewed unto Israel .
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal @-@ berith , wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
and he went unto his father 's house at Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
and all the men of Shechem gathered together , and all the house of Millo , and went , and made Abimelech king , by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem .
and when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , Hearken unto me , ye men of Shechem , that God may hearken unto you .
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive tree , reign thou over us .
but the olive tree said unto them , Should I leave my fatness , wherewith by me they honour God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
and the vine said unto them , Should I leave my wine , which cheereth God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
( for my father fought for you , and adventured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian :
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of Shechem , because he is your brother ; )
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice ye in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the men of Shechem , and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem , and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech .
and Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and dwelt there , for fear of Abimelech his brother .
then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem ; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech :
and the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
and Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren , and went over to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and Cursed Abimelech .
and would to God this people were under my hand ! then would I remove Abimelech . and he said to Abimelech , Increase thine army , and come out .
and when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , his anger was kindled .
and he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily , saying , behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem ; and , behold , they fortify the city against thee .
now therefore up by night , thou and the people that is with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , thou shalt rise early , and set upon the city : and , behold , when he and the people that is with him come out against thee , then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion .
and Abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies .
and Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and Abimelech rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and Abimelech chased him , and he fled before him , and many were overthrown and wounded , even unto the entering of the gate .
and Abimelech dwelt at Arumah : and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren , that they should not dwell in Shechem .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smote them .
and Abimelech , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
and Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people that was therein , and beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
and when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith .
and it was told Abimelech , that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and followed Abimelech , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and gat them up to the top of the tower .
and Abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech 's head , and all to brake his skull .
and when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man unto his place .
thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech , which he did unto his father , in slaying his seventy brethren :
and all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
and after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah , the son of Dodo , a man of Issachar ; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim .
and he judged Israel twenty and three years , and died , and was buried in Shamir .
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts , and they had thirty cities , which are called Havoth @-@ jair unto this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim , and Ashtaroth , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Zidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines , and forsook the Lord , and served not him .
and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines , and into the hands of the children of Ammon .
moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; so that Israel was sore distressed .
and the Lord said unto the children of Israel , did not I deliver you from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
the Zidonians also , and the Amalekites , and the Maonites , did oppress you ; and ye cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen ; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation .
and the children of Israel said unto the Lord , We have sinned : do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee ; deliver us only , we pray thee , this day .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the Lord : and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then the children of Ammon were gathered together , and encamped in Gilead . and the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in Mizpeh .
and the people and princes of Gilead said one to another , What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour , and he was the son of an harlot : and Gilead begat Jephthah .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the children of Ammon made war against Israel .
and it was so , that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob :
and they said unto Jephthah , Come , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of Ammon .
and Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , did not ye hate me , and expel me out of my father 's house ? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , Therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
and Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon , and the Lord deliver them before me , shall I be your head ?
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , The Lord be witness between us , if we do not so according to THY words .
then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them : and Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh .
and Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon :
and said unto him , Thus saith Jephthah , Israel took not away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon :
but when Israel came up from Egypt , and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea , and came to Kadesh ;
and Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon ; and Israel said unto him , Let us pass , we pray thee , through THY land into my place .
but Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and pitched in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
and the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smote them : so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
and they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites , from Arnon even unto Jabbok , and from the wilderness even unto Jordan .
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh THY god giveth thee to possess ? so whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us , them will we possess .
and now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns , and in Aroer and her towns , and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon , three hundred years ? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time ?
Wherefore I have not sinned against thee , but thou doest me wrong to war against me : the Lord the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon .
Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him .
then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said , If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands ,
then it shall be , that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , shall surely be the Lord 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering .
so Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them ; and the Lord delivered them into his hands .
and Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .
and he said , Go . and he sent her away for two months : and she went with her companions , and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains .
and the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together , and went northward , and said unto Jephthah , Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon , and didst not call us to go with thee ? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire .
and Jephthah said unto them , I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon ; and when I called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the Lord delivered them into my hand : wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
and Jephthah judged Israel six years . then died Jephthah the Gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead .
and he had thirty sons , and thirty daughters , whom he sent abroad , and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons . and he judged Israel seven years .
then died Ibzan , and was buried at Bethlehem .
and Elon the Zebulonite died , and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun .
and he had forty sons and thirty nephews , that rode on threescore and ten ass colts : and he judged Israel eight years .
and Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of the Amalekites .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years .
and there was a certain man of Zorah , of the family of the Danites , whose name was Manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman , and said unto her , behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceive , and bear a son .
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no rasor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
then the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came unto me , and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God , very terrible : but I asked him not whence he was , neither told he me his name :
then Manoah intreated the Lord , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
and God hearkened to the voice of Manoah ; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field : but Manoah her husband was not with her .
and the woman made haste , and ran , and shewed her husband , and said unto him , behold , the man hath appeared unto me , that came unto me the other day .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
and Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord , I pray thee , let us detain thee , until we shall have made ready a kid for thee .
and the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah , Though thou detain me , I will not eat of THY bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the Lord . for Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord .
so Manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord : and the angel did wondrously ; and Manoah and his wife looked on .
for it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar . and Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
but the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife . then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord .
and Samson went down to Timnath , and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord , that he sought an occasion against the Philistines : for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel .
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnath , and came to the vineyards of Timnath : and , behold , a young lion roared against him .
and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and he went down , and talked with the woman ; and she pleased Samson well .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion .
so his father went down unto the woman : and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
and it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
and he said unto them , Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . and they could not in three days expound the riddle .
and her father said , I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to THY companion : is not her younger sister fairer than she ? take her , I pray thee , instead of her .
and Samson said concerning them , Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines , though I do them a displeasure .
and Samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took firebrands , and turned tail to tail , and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks , and also the standing corn , with the vineyards and olives .
and Samson said unto them , Though ye have done this , yet will I be avenged of you , and after that I will cease .
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam .
then the Philistines went up , and pitched in Judah , and spread themselves in Lehi .
and they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines . and Samson said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place Ramath @-@ lehi .
and he was sore athirst , and called on the Lord , and said , Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of THY servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
and Samson said unto her , If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and he said unto her , If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
and she said , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson . and he awoke out of his sleep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he wist not that the Lord was departed from him .
but the Philistines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grind in the prison house .
Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
and it came to pass , when their hearts were merry , that they said , Call for Samson , that he may make us sport . and they called for Samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand , suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth , that I may lean upon them .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that beheld while Samson made sport .
and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a Graven image and a molten image : and they were in the house of Micah .
and the man Micah had an house of gods , and made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
in those days there was no king in Israel , but every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah , who was a Levite , and he sojourned there .
and the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah , as he journeyed .
and Micah said unto him , Whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah , and I go to sojourn where I may find a place .
and the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons .
and Micah consecrated the Levite ; and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
in those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel .
and they said unto him , Ask counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
and the priest said unto them , Go in peace : before the Lord is your way wherein ye go .
and they said , arise , that we may go up against them : for we have seen the land , and , behold , it is very good : and are ye still ? be not slothful to go , and to enter to possess the land .
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for God hath given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth .
and there went from thence of the family of the Danites , out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war .
and they went up , and pitched in Kirjath @-@ jearim , in Judah : wherefore they called that place Mahaneh @-@ Dan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kirjath @-@ jearim .
and they passed thence unto mount Ephraim , and came unto the house of Micah .
and they turned thitherward , and came to the house of the young man the Levite , even unto the house of Micah , and saluted him .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of Dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
and these went into Micah 's house , and fetched the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image . then said the priest unto them , What do ye ?
and the priest 's heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the Graven image , and went in the midst of the people .
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them .
and when they were a good way from the house of Micah , the men that were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
and they cried unto the children of Dan . and they turned their faces , and said unto Micah , What aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ?
and he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?
and the children of Dan said unto him , Let not THY voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee , and thou lose THY life , with the lives of THY household .
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
and they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the Graven image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in Israel , that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah .
and his father in law , the damsel 's father , retained him ; and he abode with him three days : so they did eat and drink , and lodged there .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel 's father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel 's father had said unto the man , Be content , I pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
and when the man rose up to depart , his father in law urged him : therefore he lodged there again .
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart : and the damsel 's father said , Comfort thine heart , I pray thee . and they tarried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
and when they were by Jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
and he said unto his servant , Come , and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night , in Gibeah , or in Ramah .
and they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah , which belongeth to Benjamin .
and they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in Gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , Whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for THY handmaid , and for the young man which is with THY servants : there is no want of any thing .
so he brought him into his house , and gave provender unto the asses : and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
and her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and he said unto her , Up , and let us be going . but none answered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and gat him unto his place .
and when he was come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , together with her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the coasts of Israel .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the Congregation was gathered together as one man , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , with the land of Gilead , unto the Lord in Mizpeh .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh . ) Then said the children of Israel , Tell us , how was this wickedness ?
and the Levite , the husband of the woman that was slain , answered and said , I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
and the men of Gibeah rose against me , and beset the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have slain me : and my concubine have they forced , that she is dead .
and I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel : for they have committed lewdness and Folly in Israel .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of Belial , which are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . but the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel :
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded ; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth , and not miss .
and the children of Israel arose , and went up to the house of God , and asked counsel of God , and said , Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? and the Lord said , Judah shall go up first .
and the children of Israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against Gibeah .
and the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
and the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again Eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of God , and wept , and sat there before the Lord , and fasted that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at other times .
and there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was sore : but they knew not that evil was near them .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah .
and the liers in wait hasted , and rushed upon Gibeah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the Benjamites looked behind them , and , behold , the flame of the city ascended up to heaven .
and when the men of Israel turned again , the men of Benjamin were amazed : for they saw that evil was come upon them .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about , and chased them , and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising .
so that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valour .
but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon , and abode in the rock Rimmon four months .
and the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smote them with the edge of the sword , as well the men of every city , as the beast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh , saying , There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife .
and the people came to the house of God , and abode there till even before God , and lifted up their voices , and wept sore ;
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
and the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
and they said , What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord ? and , behold , there came none to the camp from Jabesh @-@ gilead to the assembly .
for the people were numbered , and , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead there .
and this is the thing that ye shall do , Ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
and the whole Congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon , and to call peaceably unto them .
and the people repented them for Benjamin , because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
and they said , There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin .
then they said , behold , there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
in those days there was no king in Israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and Elimelech Naomi 's husband died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
and they took them wives of the women of Moab ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the other Ruth : and they dwelled there about ten years .
and Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them ; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband .
then she arose with her daughters in law , that she might return from the country of Moab : for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah .
and Naomi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the Lord deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the Lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
and Naomi said , Turn again , my daughters : why will ye go with me ? are there yet any more sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
turn again , my daughters , go your way ; for I am too old to have an husband . if I should say , I have hope , if I should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
and they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and Orpah kissed her mother in law ; but Ruth clave unto her .
and she said , behold , THY sister in law is gone back unto her people , and unto her gods : return thou after THY sister in law .
where thou diest , will I die , and there will I be buried : the Lord do so to me , and more also , if ought but death part thee and me .
when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , then she left speaking unto her .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . and it came to pass , when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Naomi ?
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and Naomi had a kinsman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of Elimelech ; and his name was Boaz .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem , and said unto the reapers , The Lord be with you . and they answered him , The Lord bless thee .
and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said , It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab :
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
the Lord recompense THY work , and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel , under whose wings thou art come to trust .
and when she was risen up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , Let her glean even among the sheaves , and reproach her not :
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her , and leave them , that she may glean them , and rebuke her not .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law , It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and dwelt with her mother in law .
wash thyself therefore , and anoint thee , and put THY raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the floor : but make not thyself known unto the man , until he shall have done eating and drinking .
and she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law bade her .
and it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himself : and , behold , a woman lay at his feet .
and now , my daughter , fear not ; I will do to thee all that thou requirest : for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman .
and now it is true that I am THY near kinsman : howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , Who art thou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
and she said , These six measures of barley gave he me ; for he said to me , Go not empty unto THY mother in law .
then said she , sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finished the thing this day .
and he said unto the kinsman , Naomi , that is come again out of the country of Moab , selleth a parcel of land , which was our brother Elimelech 's :
and Boaz said unto the elders , and unto all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and all that was Chilion 's and Mahlon 's , of the hand of Naomi .
and let THY house be like the house of Pharez , whom Tamar bare unto Judah , of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman .
so Boaz took Ruth , and she was his wife : and when he went in unto her , the Lord gave her conception , and she bare a son .
and the women said unto Naomi , blessed be the Lord , which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman , that his name may be famous in Israel .
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of THY life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for THY daughter in law , which loveth thee , which is better to thee than seven sons , hath born him .
and Naomi took the child , and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse unto it .
and the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Naomi ; and they called his name Obed : he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
and Obed begat Jesse , and Jesse begat David .
now there was a certain man of Ramathaim @-@ zophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephrathite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah : and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
and when the time was that Elkanah offered , he gave to Peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion ; for he loved Hannah : but the Lord had shut up her womb .
and her adversary also provoked her sore , for to make her fret , because the Lord had shut up her womb .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the Lord , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk . now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord .
and she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed unto the Lord , and wept sore .
and it came to pass , as she continued praying before the Lord , that Eli marked her mouth .
now Hannah , she spake in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard : therefore Eli thought she had been drunken .
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto .
and she said , Let thine handmaid find grace in THY sight . so the woman went her way , and did eat , and her countenance was no more sad .
and they rose up in the morning early , and worshipped before the Lord , and returned , and came to their house to Ramah : and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife ; and the Lord remembered her .
Wherefore it came to pass , when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bare a son , and called his name Samuel , saying , Because I have asked him of the Lord .
and the man Elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
but Hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be weaned , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the Lord , and there abide for ever .
and when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh : and the child was young .
and they slew a bullock , and brought the child to Eli .
and she said , Oh my lord , as THY soul liveth , my lord , I am the woman that stood by thee here , praying unto the Lord .
for this child I prayed ; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him :
and Hannah prayed , and said , My heart rejoiceth in the Lord , mine Horn is exalted in the Lord : my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies ; because I rejoice in THY salvation .
talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for the Lord is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
the bows of the mighty men are broken , and they that stumbled are girded with strength .
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hungry ceased : so that the barren hath born seven ; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
the Lord killeth , and maketh alive : he bringeth down to the grave , and bringeth up .
he will keep the feet of his saints , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heaven shall he Thunder upon them : the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto his king , and exalt the Horn of his anointed .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself . so they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither .
Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord : for men abhorred the offering of the Lord .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
and the Lord visited Hannah , so that she conceived , and bare three sons and two daughters . and the child Samuel grew before the Lord .
now Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
Nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the Lord 's people to transgress .
and the child Samuel grew on , and was in favour both with the Lord , and also with men .
and there came a man of God unto Eli , and said unto him , Thus saith the Lord , did I plainly appear unto the house of THY father , when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of THY father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon THY two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli . and the word of the Lord was precious in those days ; there was no open vision .
and it came to pass at that time , when Eli was laid down in his place , and his eyes began to wax dim , that he could not see ;
and ERE the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord , where the Ark of God was , and Samuel was laid down to sleep ;
now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him .
and the Lord called Samuel again the third time . and he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me . and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child .
therefore Eli said unto Samuel , Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speak , Lord ; for THY servant heareth . so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
and the Lord said to Samuel , behold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
in that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
for I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not .
and Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the Lord . and Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision .
and Samuel grew , and the Lord was with him , and did let none of his words fall to the ground .
and all Israel from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord .
and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh : for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord .
and the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
so the people sent to Shiloh , that they might bring from thence the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of hosts , which dwelleth between the cherubims : and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God .
and when the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
and when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews ? and they understood that the Ark of the Lord was come into the camp .
and the Philistines were afraid , for they said , God is come into the camp . and they said , Woe unto us ! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore .
Woe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
and the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
and the Ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were slain .
and there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army , and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent , and with earth upon his head .
now Eli was ninety and eight years old ; and his eyes were dim , that he could not see .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , Fear not ; for thou hast born a son . but she answered not , neither did she regard it .
when the Philistines took the Ark of God , they brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
and when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the Ark of the Lord . and they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any that come into Dagon 's house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day .
and when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , The Ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us : for his hand is sore upon us , and upon Dagon our god .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smote the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emerods in their secret parts .
and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods : and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
and the Ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months .
and the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , What shall we do to the Ark of the Lord ? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place .
Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts , as the Egyptians and Pharoah hardened their hearts ? when he had wrought wonderfully among them , did they not let the people go , and they departed ?
now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there hath come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring their calves home from them :
and the men did so ; and took two milch kine , and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home :
and they laid the Ark of the Lord upon the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods .
and the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth @-@ shemesh , and went along the highway , lowing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth @-@ shemesh .
and they of Beth @-@ shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ark , and rejoiced to see it .
and the cart came into the field of Joshua , a Beth @-@ shemite , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they clave the wood of the cart , and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord .
and the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord , and the coffer that was with it , wherein the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of Beth @-@ shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord .
and when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
and these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the Lord ; for Ashdod one , for Gaza one , for Askelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
and the men of Beth @-@ shemesh said , Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God ? and to whom shall he go up from us ?
and the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim came , and fetched up the Ark of the Lord , and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill , and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of the Lord .
and it came to pass , while the Ark abode in Kirjath @-@ jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord .
and they gathered together to Mizpeh , and drew water , and poured it out before the Lord , and fasted on that day , and said there , We have sinned against the Lord . and Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
and Samuel took a sucking lamb , and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord : and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel ; and the Lord heard him .
and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel : but the Lord thundered with a great Thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were smitten before Israel .
and the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh , and pursued the Philistines , and smote them , until they came under Beth @-@ car .
so the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
and he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel , and Gilgal , and Mizpeh , and judged Israel in all those places .
and his return was to Ramah ; for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel ; and there he built an altar unto the Lord .
and it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
now the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abiah : they were judges in Beer @-@ sheba .
and the Lord said unto Samuel , Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
now therefore hearken unto their voice : howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them , and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries , and to be cooks , and to be Bakers .
and he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
that we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles .
and Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
and he had a son , whose name was Saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he : from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
and the asses of Kish Saul 's father were lost . and Kish said to Saul his son , Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
and when they were come to the land of Zuph , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
( Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he spake , Come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer . )
then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go . so they went unto the city where the man of God was .
and as they went up the hill to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said unto them , Is the seer here ?
and they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make haste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came , saying ,
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , where the seer 's house is .
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not THY mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all THY father 's house ?
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
and Samuel said unto the cook , Bring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , Set it by thee .
and when they were come down from the high place into the city , Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house .
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said , Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
and they will salute thee , and give thee two loaves of bread ; which thou shalt receive of their hands .
and the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
and let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
and it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
and when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of Kish ? is Saul also among the prophets ?
and when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
and Saul said unto his uncle , He told us plainly that the asses were found . but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof Samuel spake , he told him not .
and when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near , the tribe of Benjamin was taken .
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Matri was taken , and Saul the son of Kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
and they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the Lord . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and Saul also went home to Gibeah ; and there went with him a band of men , whose hearts God had touched .
then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul , and told the tidings in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and wept .
and , behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field ; and Saul said , What aileth the people that they weep ? and they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh .
and when he numbered them in Bezek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jabesh said , To morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you .
and Samuel said unto all Israel , behold , I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me , and have made a king over you .
and he said unto them , The Lord is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . and they answered , He is witness .
and Samuel said unto the people , It is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and to your fathers .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
and when they forgat the Lord their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
and they cried unto the Lord , and said , We have sinned , because we have forsaken the Lord , and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
and when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , ye said unto me , Nay ; but a king shall reign over us : when the Lord your God was your king .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the Lord hath set a king over you .
if ye will fear the Lord , and serve him , and obey his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God :
but if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
so Samuel called unto the Lord ; and the Lord sent Thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel .
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which cannot profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people .
moreover as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you : but I will teach you the good and the right way :
Saul reigned one year ; and when he had reigned two years over Israel ,
and Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it . and Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , Let the Hebrews hear .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude : and they came up , and pitched in Michmash , eastward from Beth @-@ aven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead . as for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
and he tarried seven days , according to the set time that Samuel had appointed : but Samuel came not to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
therefore said I , The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal , and I have not made supplication unto the Lord : I forced myself therefore , and offered a burnt offering .
and Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord THY God , which he commanded thee : for now would the Lord have established THY kingdom upon Israel for ever .
but now THY kingdom shall not continue : the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart , and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people , because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee .
and Samuel arose , and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin . and Saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
and Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , abode in Gibeah of Benjamin : but the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah , unto the land of Shual :
now there was no Smith found throughout all the land of Israel : for the Philistines said , Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears :
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines , to sharpen every man his share , and his coulter , and his axe , and his mattock .
yet they had a file for the mattocks , and for the coulters , and for the forks , and for the axes , and to sharpen the goads .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
now it came to pass upon a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
and Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
and Ahiah , the son of Ahitub , I @-@ chabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the Lord 's priest in Shiloh , wearing an ephod . and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
and between the passages , by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines ' garrison , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
the forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash , and the other southward over against Gibeah .
if they say thus unto us , Tarry until we come to you ; then we will stand still in our place , and will not go up unto them .
but if they say thus , Come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines : and the Philistines said , behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked ; and , behold , the multitude melted away , and they went on beating down one another .
then said Saul unto the people that were with him , Number now , and see who is gone from us . and when they had numbered , behold , Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there .
and it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased : and Saul said unto the priest , Withdraw thine hand .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and dipped it in an honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then said Jonathan , My father hath troubled the land : see , I pray you , how mine eyes have been enlightened , because I tasted a little of this honey .
how much more , if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ?
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and Saul built an altar unto the Lord : the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord .
for , as the Lord liveth , which saveth Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . but there was not a man among all the people that answered him .
then Saul went up from following the Philistines : and the Philistines went to their own place .
so Saul took the kingdom over Israel , and fought against all his enemies on every side , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines : and whithersoever he turned himself , he vexed them .
and he gathered an host , and smote the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Ishui , and Melchi @-@ shua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
and Kish was the father of Saul ; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
and there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , he took him unto him .
Samuel also said unto Saul , The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord .
thus saith the Lord of hosts , I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the way , when he came up from Egypt .
and Saul came to a city of Amalek , and laid wait in the valley .
and Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur , that is over against Egypt .
and he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel , saying ,
it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hath not performed my commandments . and it grieved Samuel ; and he cried unto the Lord all night .
and when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Saul came to Carmel , and , behold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to Gilgal .
and Samuel came to Saul : and Saul said unto him , blessed be thou of the Lord : I have performed the commandment of the Lord .
and Samuel said , When thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel ?
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord , but didst fly upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of the Lord ?
and Saul said unto Samuel , Yea , I have obeyed the voice of the Lord , and have gone the way which the Lord sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the Lord .
and Samuel said unto Saul , I will not return with thee : for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel .
and as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
and Samuel said unto him , The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day , and hath given it to a neighbour of thine , that is better than thou .
then he said , I have sinned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the Lord THY God .
and Samuel said , As THY sword hath made women childless , so shall THY mother be childless among women . and Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal .
then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
then Samuel took the Horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
and Saul said unto his servants , Provide me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
and Jesse took an ass laden with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a kid , and sent them by David his son unto Saul .
and Saul sent to Jesse , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Shochoh , which belongeth to Judah , and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah , in Ephes @-@ dammim .
and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
and he had greaves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
and the staff of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah , whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul .
and the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and next unto him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel , were in the valley of Elah , fighting with the Philistines .
for Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array , army against army .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the armies of the Philistines , and spake according to the same words : and David heard them .
and all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sore afraid .
and the people answered him after this manner , saying , So shall it be done to the man that killeth him .
and he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
and when the words were heard which David spake , they rehearsed them before Saul : and he sent for him .
and Saul said to David , Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
THY servant slew both the lion and the bear : and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God .
David said moreover , The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the Lord be with thee .
and Saul armed David with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the Brook , and put them in a shepherd 's bag which he had , even in a scrip ; and his sling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Philistine .
and the Philistine came on and drew near unto David ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
and when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
and the Philistine said unto David , Am I a dog , that thou comest to me with staves ? and the Philistine Cursed David by his gods .
and the Philistine said to David , Come to me , and I will give THY flesh unto the fowls of the air , and to the beasts of the field .
and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle is the Lord 's , and he will give you into our hands .
and it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came and drew nigh to meet David , that David hasted , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they spoiled their tents .
and as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul , that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David , and Jonathan loved him as his own soul .
and Saul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father 's house .
and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
and Saul cast the javelin ; for he said , I will smite David even to the wall with it . and David avoided out of his presence twice .
and Saul was afraid of David , because the Lord was with him , and was departed from Saul .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and David behaved himself wisely in all his ways ; and the Lord was with him .
Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely , he was afraid of him .
and David said unto Saul , Who am I ? and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son in law to the king ?
but it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul 's daughter should have been given to David , that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife .
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commune with David secretly , and say , behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and Saul 's servants spake those words in the ears of David . and David said , Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ?
and the servants of Saul told him , saying , On this manner spake David .
and when his servants told David these words , it pleased David well to be the king 's son in law : and the days were not expired .
and Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David , and that Michal Saul 's daughter loved him .
then the princes of the Philistines went forth : and it came to pass , after they went forth , that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul ; so that his name was much set by .
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
and Jonathan called David , and Jonathan shewed him all those things . and Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence , as in times past .
and there was war again : and David went out , and fought with the Philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter ; and they fled from him .
and the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul , as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand : and David played with his hand .
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul also sent messengers unto David 's house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning : and Michal David 's wife told him , saying , If thou save not THY life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slain .
so Michal let David down through a window : and he went , and fled , and escaped .
and Michal took an image , and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster , and covered it with a cloth .
and Saul sent the messengers again to see David , saying , Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may slay him .
and when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster .
so David fled , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . and he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth .
and it was told Saul , saying , behold , David is at Naioth in Ramah .
and when it was told Saul , he sent other messengers , and they prophesied likewise . and Saul sent messengers again the third time , and they prophesied also .
and he went thither to Naioth in Ramah : and the Spirit of God was upon him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth in Ramah .
if THY father at all miss me , then say , David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city : for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
if he say thus , It is well ; THY servant shall have peace : but if he be very wroth , then be sure that evil is determined by him .
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with THY servant ; for thou hast brought THY servant into a Covenant of the Lord with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in me iniquity , slay me thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring me to THY father ?
and Jonathan said , Far be it from thee : for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee , then would not I tell it thee ?
and thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the Lord , that I die not :
but also thou shalt not cut off THY kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
so Jonathan made a Covenant with the house of David , saying , Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David 's enemies .
and Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
and when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel .
and I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof , as though I shot at a mark .
but if I say thus unto the young man , behold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go THY way : for the Lord hath sent thee away .
and as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of , behold , the Lord be between thee and me for ever .
so David hid himself in the field : and when the new moon was come , the king sat him down to eat meat .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be established , nor THY kingdom . Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me , for he shall surely die .
and Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him : whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David .
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
and he said unto his lad , Run , find out now the arrows which I shoot . and as the lad ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
and Jonathan cried after the lad , Make speed , haste , stay not . and Jonathan 's lad gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
but the lad knew not any thing : only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
and as soon as the lad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until David exceeded .
then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest : and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David , and said unto him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and the priest answered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hallowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg , an Edomite , the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul .
and David arose , and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
and the servants of Achish said unto him , Is not this David the king of the land ? did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
David therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave Adullam : and when his brethren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down thither to him .
and every one that was in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was discontented , gathered themselves unto him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
and the prophet Gad said unto David , abide not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of Judah . then David departed , and came into the forest of Hareth .
when Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men that were with him , ( now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah , having his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ; )
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , Hear now , ye Benjamites ; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds ;
then answered Doeg the Edomite , which was set over the servants of Saul , and said , I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests that were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
and Nob , the city of the priests , smote he with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
and one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped , and fled after David .
abide thou with me , fear not : for he that seeketh my life seeketh THY life : but with me thou shalt be in safeguard .
so David and his men went to Keilah , and fought with the Philistines , and brought away their cattle , and smote them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
and it came to pass , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
and it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah . and Saul said , God hath delivered him into mine hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that hath gates and bars .
and Saul called all the people together to war , to go down to Keilah , to besiege David and his men .
then said David , O Lord God of Israel , THY servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
then David and his men , which were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went whithersoever they could go . and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah ; and he forbare to go forth .
and David abode in the wilderness in strong holds , and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph . and Saul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
and David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life : and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood .
and he said unto him , Fear not : for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over Israel , and I shall be next unto thee ; and that also Saul my father knoweth .
and they two made a Covenant before the Lord : and David abode in the wood , and Jonathan went to his house .
then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of Jeshimon ?
now therefore , O king , come down according to all the desire of THY soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king 's hand .
go , I pray you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his haunt is , and who hath seen him there : for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly .
and they arose , and went to Ziph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of Jeshimon .
Saul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : wherefore he came down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of Maon . and when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .
and Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them .
but there came a messenger unto Saul , saying , haste thee , and come ; for the Philistines have invaded the land .
and David went up from thence , and dwelt in strong holds at En @-@ gedi .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , behold , David is in the wilderness of En @-@ gedi .
then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats .
and he came to the sheepcotes by the way , where was a cave ; and Saul went in to cover his feet : and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
and it came to pass afterward , that David 's heart smote him , because he had cut off Saul 's skirt .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . but Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
David also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , My lord the king . and when Saul looked behind him , David stooped with his face to the earth , and bowed himself .
the Lord judge between me and thee , and the Lord avenge me of thee : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
after whom is the king of Israel come out ? after whom dost thou pursue ? after a dead dog , after a flea .
the Lord therefore be judge , and judge between me and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver me out of thine hand .
and it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul , that Saul said , Is this THY voice , my son David ? and Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
for if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day .
and now , behold , I know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand .
swear now therefore unto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and Samuel died ; and all the Israelites were gathered together , and lamented him , and buried him in his house at Ramah . and David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
and there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was Shearing his sheep in Carmel .
now the name of the man was Nabal ; and the name of his wife Abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of Caleb .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said unto the young men , Get you up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name :
and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity , Peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be unto all that thou hast .
and now I have heard that thou hast shearers : now THY shepherds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing unto them , all the while they were in Carmel .
and when David 's young men came , they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men , whom I know not whence they be ?
so David 's young men turned their way , and went again , and came and told him all those sayings .
but the men were very good unto us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conversant with them , when we were in the fields :
they were a wall unto us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
and it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
so and more also do God unto the enemies of David , if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
and when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
and fell at his feet , and said , Upon me , my lord , upon me let this iniquity be : and let thine handmaid , I pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the words of thine handmaid .
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord , and evil hath not been found in thee all THY days .
yet a man is risen to pursue thee , and to seek THY soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord THY God ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
and it shall come to pass , when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee , and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel ;
that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offence of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causeless , or that my lord hath avenged himself : but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid .
and blessed be THY advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said unto her , Go up in peace to thine house ; see , I have hearkened to THY voice , and have accepted THY person .
and Abigail came to Nabal ; and , behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken : wherefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and it came to pass about ten days after , that the Lord smote Nabal , that he died .
and when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel , they spake unto her , saying , David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife .
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
and the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah , saying , Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon ?
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
and Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah , which is before Jeshimon , by the way . but David abode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David therefore sent out spies , and understood that Saul was come in very deed .
and David arose , and came to the place where Saul had pitched : and David beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his host : and Saul lay in the trench , and the people pitched round about him .
so David and Abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the trench , and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster : but Abner and the people lay round about him .
David said furthermore , As the Lord liveth , the Lord shall smite him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall descend into battle , and perish .
the Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's anointed : but , I pray thee , take thou now the spear that is at his bolster , and the cruse of water , and let us go .
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill afar off ; a great space being between them :
and he said , Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in mine hand ?
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains .
and David answered and said , behold the king 's spear ! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
the Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness : for the Lord delivered thee into my hand to day , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's anointed .
and , behold , as THY life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
and David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
and David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
and it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath : and he sought no more again for him .
and the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months .
and David smote the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparel , and returned , and came to Achish .
and Achish said , Whither have ye made a road to day ? and David said , Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites .
and it came to pass in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . and Achish said unto David , Know thou assuredly , that thou shalt go out with me to battle , thou and THY men .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . and Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
and the Philistines gathered themselves together , and came and pitched in Shunem : and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they pitched in Gilboa .
and when Saul saw the host of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly trembled .
and when Saul inquired of the Lord , the Lord answered him not , neither by dreams nor by Urim , nor by prophets .
and the woman said unto him , behold , thou knowest what Saul hath done , how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ?
and Saul sware to her by the Lord , saying , As the Lord liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice : and the woman spake to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceived me ? for thou art Saul .
and the Lord hath done to him , as he spake by me : for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and given it to THY neighbour , even to David :
because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord , nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek , therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day .
moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines : and to morrow shalt thou and THY sons be with me : the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines .
then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth , and was sore afraid , because of the words of Samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
and the woman came unto Saul , and saw that he was sore troubled , and said unto him , behold , thine handmaid hath obeyed THY voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hearkened unto THY words which thou spakest unto me .
now therefore , I pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on THY way .
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hearkened unto their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat upon the bed .
and the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hasted , and killed it , and took flour , and kneaded it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof :
and she brought it before Saul , and before his servants ; and they did eat . then they rose up , and went away that night .
now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek : and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel .
and the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands : but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
and Achish answered and said to David , I know that thou art good in my sight , as an angel of God : notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said , He shall not go up with us to the battle .
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with THY master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
so David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . and the Philistines went up to Jezreel .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day , that the Amalekites had invaded the south , and Ziklag , and smitten Ziklag , and burned it with fire ;
and had taken the women captives , that were therein : they slew not any , either great or small , but carried them away , and went on their way .
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
and David 's two wives were taken captives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
and David was greatly distressed ; for the people spake of stoning him , because the soul of all the people was grieved , every man for his sons and for his daughters : but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God .
and they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins : and when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him : for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
we made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites , and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah , and upon the south of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire .
and David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon camels , and fled .
and there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil , nor any thing that they had taken to them : David recovered all .
then said David , Ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the Lord hath given us , who hath preserved us , and delivered the company that came against us into our hand .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and it was so from that day forward , that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day .
and when David came to Ziklag , he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah , even to his friends , saying , behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord ;
and to them which were in Rachal , and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites ,
and to them which were in Hormah , and to them which were in Chor @-@ ashan , and to them which were in Athach ,
and to them which were in Hebron , and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt .
now the Philistines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
and the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ shua , Saul 's sons .
and the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of the archers .
and when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise upon his sword , and died with him .
so Saul died , and his three sons , and his armourbearer , and all his men , that same day together .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth : and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth @-@ Shan .
and when the inhabitants of Jabesh @-@ gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul ;
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth @-@ Shan , and came to Jabesh , and burnt them there .
now it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , and David had abode two days in Ziklag ;
it came even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent , and earth upon his head : and so it was , when he came to David , that he fell to the earth , and did obeisance .
and David said unto him , How went the matter ? I pray thee , tell me . and he answered , That the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also .
and the young man that told him said , As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa , behold , Saul leaned upon his spear ; and , lo , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
and when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called unto me . and I answered , Here am I.
and he said unto me again , Stand , I pray thee , upon me , and slay me : for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
then David took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the Lord , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son :
( also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jasher . )
from the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of Jonathan turned not back , and the sword of Saul returned not empty .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
Ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! O Jonathan , thou was slain in thine high places .
I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : THY love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
so David went up thither , and his two wives also , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail Nabal 's wife the Carmelite .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
and the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . and they told David , saying , That the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead were they that buried Saul .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ gilead , and said unto them , blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and now the Lord shew kindness and truth unto you : and I also will requite you this kindness , because ye have done this thing .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them .
but Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's host , took Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
Ish @-@ bosheth Saul 's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and reigned two years . but the house of Judah followed David .
and the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
and Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
and Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out , and met together by the pool of Gibeon : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin , which pertained to Ish @-@ bosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and there was a very sore battle that day ; and Abner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
and there were three sons of Zeruiah there , Joab , and Abishai , and Asahel : and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe .
and Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner .
then Abner looked behind him , and said , Art thou Asahel ? and he answered , I am .
and Abner said to him , Turn thee aside to THY right hand or to THY left , and lay thee hold on one of the young men , and take thee his armour . but Asahel would not turn aside from following of him .
and Abner said again to Asahel , Turn thee aside from following me : wherefore should I smite thee to the ground ? how then should I hold up my face to Joab THY brother ?
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah , that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon .
and the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
and Joab said , As God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
and Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
and Joab returned from following Abner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men and Asahel .
but the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin , and of Abner 's men , so that three hundred and threescore men died .
and they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : but David waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker .
and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
and the sixth , Ithream , by Eglah David 's wife . these were born to David in Hebron .
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
and Saul had a concubine , whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah : and Ish @-@ bosheth said to Abner , Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father 's concubine ?
and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim . then said Abner unto him , Go , return . and he returned .
and Abner had communication with the elders of Israel , saying , Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you :
now then do it : for the Lord hath spoken of David , saying , By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies .
and Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin : and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
so Abner came to David to Hebron , and twenty men with him . and David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast .
when Joab and all the host that was with him were come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Joab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ? behold , Abner came unto thee ; why is it that thou hast sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know THY going out and THY coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
and when Joab was come out from David , he sent messengers after Abner , which brought him again from the well of Sirah : but David knew it not .
and afterward when David heard it , he said , I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner :
so Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner , because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle .
and they buried Abner in Hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
THY hands were not bound , nor THY feet put into fetters : as a man falleth before wicked men , so fellest thou . and all the people wept again over him .
and all the people took notice of it , and it pleased them : as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people .
for all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner .
and I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me : the Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness .
and when Saul 's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron , his hands were feeble , and all the Israelites were troubled .
and the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish @-@ bosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron , and spake , saying , behold , we are THY bone and THY flesh .
also in time past , when Saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord said to thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be a captain over Israel .
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord : and they anointed David king over Israel .
David was thirty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years .
in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months : and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah .
nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion : the same is the city of David .
and David went on , and grew great , and the Lord God of hosts was with him .
and David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
and David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem , after he was come from Hebron : and there were yet sons and daughters born to David .
and these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem ; Shammua , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon ,
but when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , all the Philistines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
and David inquired of the Lord , saying , shall I go up to the Philistines ? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the Lord said unto David , Go up : for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
and the Philistines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
and when David inquired of the Lord , he said , Thou shalt not go up ; but fetch a compass behind them , and come upon them over against the mulberry trees .
and let it be , when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself : for then shall the Lord go out before thee , to smite the host of the Philistines .
and they set the Ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
and when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the Ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the Ark of God .
and David was displeased , because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah : and he called the name of the place Perez @-@ uzzah to this day .
so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and the Ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite three months : and the Lord blessed Obed @-@ edom , and all his household .
and it was so , that when they that bare the Ark of the Lord had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
and David danced before the Lord with all his might ; and David was girded with a linen ephod .
so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she despised him in her heart .
and they brought in the Ark of the Lord , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
and as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multitude of Israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine . so all the people departed every one to his house .
and I will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
and it came to pass , when the king sat in his house , and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies ;
and it came to pass that night , that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan , saying ,
whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel :
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of THY sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and when THY days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with THY fathers , I will set up THY seed after thee , which shall proceed out of THY bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
but my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
and thine house and THY kingdom shall be established for ever before thee : THY throne shall be established for ever .
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David .
then went king David in , and sat before the Lord , and he said , Who am I , O Lord God ? and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
and this was yet a small thing in THY sight , O Lord God ; but thou hast spoken also of THY servant 's house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , O Lord God ?
for THY word 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all these great things , to make THY servant know them .
Wherefore thou art great , O Lord God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for thou hast confirmed to thyself THY people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever : and thou , Lord , art become their God .
and now , O Lord God , the word that thou hast spoken concerning THY servant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast said .
and let THY name be magnified for ever , saying , The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel : and let the house of THY servant David be established before thee .
for thou , O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to THY servant , saying , I will build thee an house : therefore hath THY servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
and now , O Lord God , thou art that God , and THY words be true , and thou hast promised this Goodness unto THY servant :
and after this it came to pass , that David smote the Philistines , and subdued them : and David took Metheg @-@ ammah out of the hand of the Philistines .
and he smote Moab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Moabites became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
David smote also Hadadezer , the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates .
and David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : and David houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for an hundred chariots .
and when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah , David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus : and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought gifts . and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
and David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
and from Betah , and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , king David took exceeding much brass .
and David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt , being Eighteen thousand men .
and he put garrisons in Edom ; throughout all Edom put he garrisons , and all they of Edom became David 's servants . and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
and David reigned over all Israel ; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people .
and Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Seraiah was the scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and David 's sons were chief rulers .
and the king said unto him , Where is he ? and Ziba said unto the king , behold , he is in the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , in Lo @-@ Debar .
then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , from Lo @-@ Debar .
then the king called to Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said unto him , I have given unto THY master 's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house .
then said Ziba unto the king , According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant , so shall THY servant do . as for Mephibosheth , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
and Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Micha . and all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
so Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem : for he did eat continually at the king 's table ; and was lame on both his feet .
and it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his stead .
Wherefore Hanun took David 's servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the Syrians of Zoba , and of Rehob , and Ish @-@ tob , and Maacah , were by themselves in the field .
when Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians :
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the Lord do that which seemeth him good .
and Joab drew nigh , and the people that were with him , unto the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city . so Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel , they gathered themselves together .
and Hadarezer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Helam . and the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and it came to pass in an eveningtide , that David arose from off his bed , and walked upon the roof of the king 's house : and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and David sent and inquired after the woman . and one said , Is not this Bath @-@ sheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Uriah the Hittite ?
and David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her uncleanness : and she returned unto her house .
and when Uriah was come unto him , David demanded of him how Joab did , and how the people did , and how the war prospered .
and David said to Uriah , Go down to THY house , and wash THY feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
but Uriah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
and when they had told David , saying , Uriah went not down unto his house , David said unto Uriah , Camest thou not from THY journey ? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house ?
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by the hand of Uriah .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die .
and it came to pass , when Joab observed the city , that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Joab : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and Uriah the Hittite died also .
and charged the messenger , saying , When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king ,
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
and the messenger said unto David , surely the men prevailed against us , and came out unto us into the field , and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate .
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon THY servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and THY servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
and when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
and the Lord sent Nathan unto David . and he came unto him , and said unto him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
and David 's anger was greatly kindled against the man ; and he said to Nathan , As the Lord liveth , the man that hath done this thing shall surely die :
and he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity .
and I gave thee THY master 's house , and THY master 's wives into THY bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord , to do evil in his sight ? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be THY wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be THY wife .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take THY wives before thine eyes , and give them unto THY neighbour , and he shall lie with THY wives in the sight of this sun .
and David said unto Nathan , I have sinned against the Lord . and Nathan said unto David , The Lord also hath put away THY sin ; thou shalt not die .
Howbeit , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme , the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die .
and Nathan departed unto his house . and the Lord struck the child that Uriah 's wife bare unto David , and it was very sick .
David therefore besought God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in , and lay all night upon the earth .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
but when David saw that his servants whispered , David perceived that the child was dead : therefore David said unto his servants , Is the child dead ? and they said , He is dead .
then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
and he said , While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept : for I said , Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me , that the child may live ?
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it : lest I take the city , and it be called after my name .
and David gathered all the people together , and went to Rabbah , and fought against it , and took it .
and he took their king 's crown from off his head , the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones : and it was set on David 's head . and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
and it came to pass after this , that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tamar ; and Amnon the son of David loved her .
and Amnon was so vexed , that he fell sick for his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her .
but Amnon had a friend , whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David 's brother : and Jonadab was a very subtil man .
so Amnon lay down , and made himself sick : and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said unto the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
so Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he was laid down . and she took flour , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and did bake the cakes .
and she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Amnon said , Have out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and Amnon said unto Tamar , Bring the meat into the chamber , that I may eat of thine hand . and Tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother .
and when she had brought them unto him to eat , he took hold of her , and said unto her , Come lie with me , my sister .
and I , whither shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice : but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her .
then he called his servant that ministered unto him , and said , Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on crying .
but when king David heard of all these things , he was very wroth .
and Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad : for Absalom hated Amnon , because he had forced his sister Tamar .
and it came to pass after two full years , that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal @-@ hazor , which is beside Ephraim : and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
and Absalom came to the king , and said , behold now , THY servant hath sheepshearers ; let the king , I beseech thee , and his servants go with THY servant .
and the king said to Absalom , Nay , my son , let us not all now go , lest we be chargeable unto thee . and he pressed him : howbeit he would not go , but blessed him .
but Absalom pressed him , that he let Amnon and all the king 's sons go with him .
and the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
then the king arose , and tare his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Amnon only is dead .
but Absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and Jonadab said unto the king , behold , the king 's sons come : as THY servant said , so it is .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept : and the king also and all his servants wept very sore .
but Absalom fled , and went to Talmai , the son of Ammihud , king of Geshur . and David mourned for his son every day .
and the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom : for he was comforted concerning Amnon , seeing he was dead .
and come to the king , and speak on this manner unto him . so Joab put the words in her mouth .
and when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , Help , O king .
and THY handmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
and the woman of Tekoah said unto the king , My lord , O king , the iniquity be on me , and on my father 's house : and the king and his throne be guiltless .
now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and THY handmaid said , I will now speak unto the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid .
for the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then thine handmaid said , The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the Lord THY God will be with thee .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath THY servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
and Joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Joab said , To day THY servant knoweth that I have found grace in THY sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
so Joab arose and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
and the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . so Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king 's face .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year 's end that he polled it : because the hair was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king 's weight .
and unto Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a fair countenance .
so Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem , and saw not the king 's face .
therefore Absalom sent for Joab , to have sent him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
then Joab arose , and came to Absalom unto his house , and said unto him , Wherefore have THY servants set my field on fire ?
so Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
and it came to pass after this , that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses , and fifty men to run before him .
and it was so , that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him .
and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
and it came to pass after forty years , that Absalom said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vow , which I have vowed unto the Lord , in Hebron .
and with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem , that were called ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew not any thing .
and there came a messenger to David , saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom .
and the king 's servants said unto the king , behold , THY servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
and the king went forth , and all his household after him . and the king left ten women , which were concubines , to keep the house .
and the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tarried in a place that was far off .
and all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men which came after him from Gath , passed on before the king .
then said the king to Ittai the Gittite , Wherefore goest thou also with us ? return to THY place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile .
and David said to Ittai , Go and pass over . and Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him .
and all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the Brook Kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
and lo Zadok also , and all the Levites were with him , bearing the Ark of the Covenant of God : and they set down the Ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and the king said unto Zadok , Carry back the Ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord , he will bring me again , and shew me both it , and his habitation :
but if he thus say , I have no delight in thee ; behold , here am I , let him do to me as seemeth good unto him .
see , I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness , until there come word from you to certify me .
and David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped God , behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
and hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's son , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
then said the king to Ziba , behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth . and Ziba said , I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in THY sight , my lord , O king .
and when king David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and Cursed still as he came .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
it may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction , and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shimei went along on the hill 's side over against him , and Cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
and the king , and all the people that were with him , came weary , and refreshed themselves there .
and it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , was come unto Absalom , that Hushai said unto Absalom , God save the king , God save the king .
and Hushai said unto Absalom , Nay ; but whom the Lord , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
and again , whom should I serve ? should I not serve in the presence of his son ? as I have served in THY father 's presence , so will I be in THY presence .
so they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house ; and Absalom went in unto his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
and the counsel of Ahithophel , which he counselled in those days , was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God : so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will smite the king only :
and I will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
and when Hushai was come to Absalom , Absalom spake unto him , saying , Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner : shall we do after his saying ? if not ; speak thou .
for , said Hushai , thou knowest THY father and his men , that they be mighty men , and they be chafed in their minds , as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field : and THY father is a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
and he also that is valiant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel knoweth that THY father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are valiant men .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
moreover , if he be gotten into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone found there .
and Absalom and all the men of Israel said , The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . for the Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom .
then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I counselled .
and the woman took and spread a covering over the well 's mouth , and spread ground corn thereon ; and the thing was not known .
then David arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over Jordan : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan .
and when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose , and gat him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
then David came to Mahanaim . and Absalom passed over Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
and Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab : which Amasa was a man 's son , whose name was Ithra an Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah Joab 's mother .
and David numbered the people that were with him , and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them .
and the king said unto them , What seemeth you best I will do . and the king stood by the gate side , and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands .
and the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
so the people went out into the field against Israel : and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim ;
where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David , and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men .
for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country : and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured .
and Joab said unto the man that told him , And , behold , thou sawest him , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground ? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver , and a girdle .
otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life : for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me .
and ten young men that bare Joab 's armour compassed about and smote Absalom , and slew him .
and they took Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok , Let me now run , and bear the king tidings , how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
and the watchman cried , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth . and he came Apace , and drew near .
and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people : for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son .
and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city , as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
and Joab came into the house to the king , and said , Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all THY servants , which this day have saved THY life , and the lives of THY sons and of THY daughters , and the lives of THY wives , and the lives of THY concubines ;
and Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back ?
Ye are my brethren , ye are my bones and my flesh : wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king ?
and he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah , even as the heart of one man ; so that they sent this word unto the king , Return thou , and all THY servants .
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
and Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite , which was of Bahurim , hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
for THY servant doth know that I have sinned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
but Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said , shall not Shimei be put to death for this , because he Cursed the Lord 's anointed ?
therefore the king said unto Shimei , Thou shalt not die . and the king sware unto him .
and Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king , and had neither dressed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace .
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , Wherefore wentest not thou with me , Mephibosheth ?
and he hath slandered THY servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God : do therefore what is good in thine eyes .
and Mephibosheth said unto the king , Yea , let him take all , forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house .
and Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan .
now Barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
THY servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king : and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward ?
and the king answered , Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
then the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him : and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
so every man of Israel went up from after David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri : but the men of Judah clave unto their king , from Jordan even to Jerusalem .
so Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah : but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
and there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
and one of Joab 's men stood by him , and said , He that favoureth Joab , and he that is for David , let him go after Joab .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
and he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel , and to Beth @-@ maachah , and all the Berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then cried a wise woman out of the city , Hear , hear ; say , I pray you , unto Joab , Come near hither , that I may speak with thee .
then she spake , saying , They were wont to speak in old time , saying , They shall surely ask counsel at Abel : and so they ended the matter .
now Joab was over all the host of Israel : and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites :
and Sheva was scribe : and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests :
Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites , What shall I do for you ? and wherewith shall I make the Atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord ?
but the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of the Lord 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she bare unto Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite :
and it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son ; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged .
and the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah , in the sepulchre of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . and after that God was intreated for the land .
moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Philistines : and David waxed faint .
and it came to pass after this , that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob : then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph , which was of the sons of the giant .
and there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines , where Elhanan the son of Jaare @-@ oregim , a Bethlehemite , slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver 's beam .
and there was yet a battle in Gath , where was a man of great stature , that had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
these four were born to the giant in Gath , and fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
the God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the Horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
I will call on the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
when the waves of death compassed me , the floods of ungodly men made me afraid ;
in my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried to my God : and he did hear my voice out of his temple , and my cry did enter into his ears .
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down ; and darkness was under his feet .
and he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : and he was seen upon the wings of the wind .
and he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
he sent from above , he took me ; he drew me out of many waters ;
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
they prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the Lord was my stay .
he brought me forth also into a large place : he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
for all his judgments were before me : and as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
I was also upright before him , and have kept myself from mine iniquity .
therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness ; according to my cleanness in his eye sight .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful , and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright .
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury .
and the afflicted people thou wilt save : but thine eyes are upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring them down .
for thou art my lamp , O Lord : and the Lord will lighten my darkness .
for by thee I have run through a troop : by my God have I leaped over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all them that trust in him .
for who is God , save the Lord ? and who is a rock , save our God ?
God is my strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my feet like hinds ' feet : and setteth me upon my high places .
he teacheth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
Thou hast also given me the shield of THY salvation : and THY gentleness hath made me great .
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me ; so that my feet did not slip .
I have pursued mine enemies , and destroyed them ; and turned not again until I had consumed them .
and I have consumed them , and wounded them , that they could not arise : yea , they are fallen under my feet .
for thou hast girded me with strength to battle : them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me .
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
they looked , but there was none to save ; even unto the Lord , but he answered them not .
then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth , I did stamp them as the mire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people , thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen : a people which I knew not shall serve me .
Strangers shall submit themselves unto me : as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto me .
the Lord liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation .
it is God that avengeth me , and that bringeth down the people under me ,
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O Lord , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto THY name .
he is the tower of salvation for his king : and sheweth mercy to his anointed , unto David , and to his seed for evermore .
now these be the last words of David . David the son of Jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the God of Jacob , and the sweet psalmist of Israel , said ,
the Spirit of the Lord spake by me , and his word was in my tongue .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spake to me , He that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds ; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain .
but the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away , because they cannot be taken with hands :
but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place .
these be the names of the mighty men whom David had : the Tachmonite that sat in the seat , chief among the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite : he lift up his spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
but he stood in the midst of the ground , and defended it , and slew the Philistines : and the Lord wrought a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam : and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim .
and David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate !
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the Lord .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
was he not most honourable of three ? therefore he was their captain : howbeit he attained not unto the first three .
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of Kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of Moab : he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he slew an Egyptian , a goodly man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .
he was more honourable than the thirty , but he attained not to the first three . and David set him over his guard .
Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin ,
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai , the son of the Maachathite , Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite ,
for the king said to Joab the captain of the host , which was with him , Go now through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , and number ye the people , that I may know the number of the people .
notwithstanding the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the host . and Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
and came to the strong hold of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hibites , and of the Canaanites : and they went out to the south of Judah , even to Beer @-@ sheba .
so when they had gone through all the land , they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
and Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
and David said unto Gad , I am in a great strait : let us fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for his mercies are great : and let me not fall into the hand of man .
so the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba seventy thousand men .
and Gad came that day to David , and said unto him , Go up , rear an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite .
and David , according to the saying of Gad , went up as the Lord commanded .
and Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
and Araunah said unto David , Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood .
and David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . so the Lord was intreated for the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he gat no heat .
Wherefore his servants said unto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in THY bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
and the damsel was very fair , and cherished the king , and ministered to him : but the king knew her not .
then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
and he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest : and they following Adonijah helped him .
but Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
now therefore come , let me , I pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of THY son Solomon .
behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , I also will come in after thee , and confirm THY words .
and Bath @-@ sheba went in unto the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king .
and she said unto him , My lord , thou swarest by the Lord THY God unto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon THY son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and now , behold , Adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not :
and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon THY servant hath he not called .
and thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders .
and , lo , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet also came in .
and they told the king , saying , behold Nathan the prophet . and when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
and Nathan said , My lord , O king , hast thou said , Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ?
but me , even me THY servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and THY servant Solomon , hath he not called .
even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel , saying , Assuredly Solomon THY son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
and king David said , Call me Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada . and they came before the king .
the king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon :
and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel : and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , God save king Solomon .
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
as the Lord hath been with my lord the king , even so be he with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David .
so Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
and Zadok the priest took an Horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon . and they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah , Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king .
and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule :
and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon : and they are come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that ye have heard .
and moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than THY name , and make his throne greater than THY throne . and the king bowed himself upon the bed .
and also thus said the king , blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid , and rose up , and went every man his way .
and Adonijah feared because of Solomon , and arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
and Solomon said , If he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die .
now the days of David drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
but shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those that eat at THY table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom THY brother .
now therefore hold him not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father ; and his kingdom was established greatly .
and he said , Speak , I pray thee , unto Solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee nay , ) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife .
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not nay . and the king said unto her , Ask on , my mother : for I will not say thee nay .
and king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
so Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
then tidings came to Joab : for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he turned not after Absalom . and Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
and it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
so Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell upon him , and slew him : and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
and the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host : and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the Brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : THY blood shall be upon thine own head .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath . and they told Shimei , saying , behold , THY servants be in Gath .
and Shimei arose , and saddled his ass , and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants : and Shimei went , and brought his servants from Gath .
and it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and was come again .
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord , and the commandment that I have charged thee with ?
the king said moreover to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to David my father : therefore the Lord shall return THY wickedness upon thine own head ;
so the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; which went out , and fell upon him , that he died . and the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
and the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar .
and now , O Lord my God , thou hast made THY servant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
and THY servant is in the midst of THY people which thou hast chosen , a great people , that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude .
and the speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all THY days .
and if thou wilt walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as THY father David did walk , then I will lengthen THY days .
and Solomon awoke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
then came there two women , that were harlots , unto the king , and stood before him .
and the one woman said , O my lord , I and this woman dwell in one house ; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
and when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
then said the king , The one saith , This is my son that liveth , and THY son is the dead : and the other saith , Nay ; but THY son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and these were the princes which he had ; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest ,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host : and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests :
and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers : and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
and Ahishar was over the household : and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute .
the son of Dekar , in Makaz , and in Shaalbim , and Beth @-@ shemesh , and Elon @-@ Beth @-@ hanan :
the son of Hesed , in Aruboth ; to him pertained Sochoh , and all the land of Hepher :
the son of Abinadab , in all the region of Dor ; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife :
Baana the son of Ahilud ; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth @-@ shean , which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel , from Beth @-@ shean to Abel @-@ meholah , even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam :
the son of Geber , in Ramoth @-@ gilead ; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; to him also pertained the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars :
Ahimaaz was in Naphtali ; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife :
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
Judah and Israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking , and making merry .
and Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines , and unto the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
ten fat oxen , and twenty oxen out of the pastures , and an hundred sheep , beside harts , and roebucks , and fallowdeer , and fatted fowl .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from Tiphsah even to Azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , all the days of Solomon .
and those officers provided victual for king Solomon , and for all that came unto king Solomon 's table , every man in his month : they lacked nothing .
and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
and Solomon 's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
for he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Chalcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol : and his fame was in all nations round about .
and he spake three thousand Proverbs : and his songs were a thousand and five .
and he spake of trees , from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he spake also of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
and Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
and Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for : and I will do all THY desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil : thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year .
and the Lord gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him : and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a league together .
and king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
and he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home : and Adoniram was over the levy .
beside the chief of Solomon 's officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
and Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders did hew them , and the stonesquarers : so they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel , in the month Zif , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the Lord .
and the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house .
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about :
the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar .
concerning this house which thou art in building , if thou wilt walk in my statutes , and execute my judgments , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will I perform my word with thee , which I spake unto David THY father :
and I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will not forsake my people Israel .
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the cieling : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir .
and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
and the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
so Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
and he set the cherubims within the inner house : and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree : the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall .
the two doors also were of olive tree ; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold upon the cherubims , and upon the palm trees .
and the two doors were of fir tree : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid , in the month Zif :
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams , that lay on forty five pillars , fifteen in a row .
and there were windows in three rows , and light was against light in three ranks .
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this porch .
and the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cubits , and stones of eight cubits .
and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones , and a row of cedar beams , both for the inner court of the house of the Lord , and for the porch of the house .
for he cast two pillars of brass , of Eighteen cubits high apiece : and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of Lily work in the porch , four cubits .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and he called the name thereof Boaz .
and upon the top of the pillars was Lily work : so was the work of the pillars finished .
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it , ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about : the knops were cast in two rows , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and it was an hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies : it contained two thousand baths .
and he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
and the work of the bases was on this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the ledges :
and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubims : and upon the ledges there was a base above : and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work .
and every base had four brasen wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had undersetters : under the laver were undersetters molten , at the side of every addition .
and under the borders were four wheels ; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit .
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axletrees , and their naves , and their felloes , and their spokes , were all molten .
and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base : and the undersetters were of the very base itself .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
after this manner he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size .
then made he ten lavers of brass : one laver contained forty baths : and every laver was four cubits : and upon every one of the ten bases one laver .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the basons . so Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lord :
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ;
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars ;
and the ten bases , and ten lavers on the bases ;
and the pots , and the shovels , and the basons : and all these vessels , which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright brass .
in the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan .
and Solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because they were exceeding many : neither was the weight of the brass found out .
and Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was ,
and the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs of gold ,
and the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
so was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto king Solomon in Jerusalem , that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Zion .
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim , which is the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark of the Lord , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
and king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the Ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims .
for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubims covered the Ark and the staves thereof above .
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
there was nothing in the Ark save the two tables of stone , which Moses put there at Horeb , when the Lord made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of the Lord ,
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud : for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
I have surely built thee an house to dwell in , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
and the king turned his face about , and blessed all the Congregation of Israel : ( and all the Congregation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of Israel , which spake with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
and it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and the Lord said unto David my father , whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name , thou didst well that it was in thine heart .
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but THY son that shall come forth out of THY loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
and the Lord hath performed his word that he spake , and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and I have set there a place for the Ark , wherein is the Covenant of the Lord , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
who hast kept with THY servant David my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let THY word , I pray thee , be verified , which thou spakest unto THY servant David my father .
but will God indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house that I have builded ?
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which THY servant prayeth before thee to day :
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which thou hast said , My name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which THY servant shall make toward this place .
and hearken thou to the supplication of THY servant , and of THY people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven THY dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
if any man trespass against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge THY servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
when THY people Israel be smitten down before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess THY name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of THY people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers .
when heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess THY name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflictest them :
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of THY servants , and of THY people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon THY land , which thou hast given to THY people for an inheritance .
if there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blasting , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpiller ; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities ; whatsoever plague , whatsoever sickness there be ;
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man , or by all THY people Israel , which shall know every man the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
then hear thou in heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ; )
that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of THY people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for THY name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of THY great name , and of THY strong hand , and of THY stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
if THY people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for THY name :
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives , saying , We have sinned , and have done perversely , we have committed wickedness ;
and so return unto thee with all their heart , and with all their soul , in the land of their enemies , which led them away captive , and pray unto thee toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , the city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name :
then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven THY dwelling place , and maintain their cause ,
and forgive THY people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them :
for they be THY people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of THY servant , and unto the supplication of THY people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
and it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord , he arose from before the altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
and he stood , and blessed all the Congregation of Israel with a loud voice , saying ,
blessed be the Lord , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
the Lord our God be with us , as he was with our fathers : let him not leave us , nor forsake us :
that he may incline our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
and let these my words , wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord , be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night , that he maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people Israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God , and that there is none else .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
and Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the Lord , two and twenty thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
that the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time , as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon .
and if thou wilt walk before me , as David THY father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded thee , and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments :
then I will establish the throne of THY kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David THY father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods , and worship them :
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hallowed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ,
( now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
and Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
for Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and Solomon built Gezer , and Beth @-@ horon the nether ,
and all the cities of store that Solomon had , and cities for his chariots , and cities for his horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
and all the people that were left of the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy , upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
these were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work .
but Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Millo .
and king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion @-@ geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of Edom .
and Hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and they came to Ophir , and fetched from thence gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king Solomon .
and when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord , she came to prove him with hard questions .
and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
and Solomon told her all her questions : there was not any thing hid from the king , which he told her not .
and she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of THY acts and of THY wisdom .
Howbeit I believed not the words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the half was not told me : THY wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard .
happy are THY men , happy are these THY servants , which stand continually before thee , and that hear THY wisdom .
and the navy also of Hiram , that brought gold from Ophir , brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees , and precious stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold .
beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country .
moreover the king made a great throne of Ivory , and overlaid it with the best gold .
the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram : once in three years came the navy of Tharshish , bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
and all the earth sought to Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and garments , and armour , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale , for abundance .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
and a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
but king Solomon loved many strange women , together with the daughter of Pharaoh , women of the Moabites , Ammonites , Edomites , Zidonians , and Hittites ;
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as was the heart of David his father .
for Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
and Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord , and went not fully after the Lord , as did David his father .
then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh , the abomination of Moab , in the hill that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech , the abomination of the children of Ammon .
Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon , Forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my Covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to THY servant .
notwithstanding in THY days I will not do it for David THY father 's sake : but I will rend it out of the hand of THY son .
Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to THY son for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon , Hadad the Edomite : he was of the king 's seed in Edom .
for it came to pass , when David was in Edom , and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain , after he had smitten every male in Edom ;
( for six months did Joab remain there with all Israel , until he had cut off every male in Edom : )
that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt ; Hadad being yet a little child .
and they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran : and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
and Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
and the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son , whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh 's house : and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's household among the sons of Pharaoh .
and when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and God stirred him up another adversary , Rezon the son of Eliadah , which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah :
and he gathered men unto him , and became captain over a band , when David slew them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and dwelt therein , and reigned in Damascus .
and he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , beside the mischief that Hadad did : and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
and Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephrathite of Zereda , Solomon 's servant , whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Millo , and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father .
and the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious , he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
and it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him , and rent it in twelve pieces :
and he said to Jeroboam , Take thee ten pieces : for thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
( but he shall have one tribe for my servant David 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel : )
but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it unto thee , even ten tribes .
and unto his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
and I will take thee , and thou shalt reign according to all that THY soul desireth , and shalt be king over Israel .
Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam . and Jeroboam arose , and fled into Egypt , unto Shishak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
and Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ; )
that they sent and called him . and Jeroboam and all the Congregation of Israel came , and spake unto Rehoboam , saying ,
THY father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make thou the grievous service of THY father , and his heavy yoke which he put upon us , lighter , and we will serve thee .
and king Rehoboam consulted with the old men , that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , How do ye advise that I may answer this people ?
and they spake unto him , saying , If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be THY servants for ever .
but he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the yoke which THY father did put upon us lighter ?
and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it lighter unto us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loins .
and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke , I will add to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with Scorpions .
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying , which the Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again , that they sent and called him unto the Congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
speak unto Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord , even unto Rehoboam king of Judah , and they shall kill me , and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah .
and he set the one in Bethel , and the other put he in Dan .
and this thing became a sin : for the people went to worship before the one , even unto Dan .
and he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of Levi .
and , behold , there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel : and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense .
the altar also was rent , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
and the man of God said unto the king , If thou wilt give me half thine house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place :
for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord , saying , eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
and he said , I may not return with thee , nor go in with thee : neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place :
for it was said to me by the word of the Lord , Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest .
so he went back with him , and did eat bread in his house , and drank water .
and it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back :
and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah , saying , Thus saith the Lord , Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord , and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord THY God commanded thee ,
but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to thee , eat no bread , and drink no water ; THY carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of THY fathers .
and it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
and he laid his carcase in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , Alas , my brother !
and it came to pass , after he had buried him , that he spake to his sons , saying , When I am dead , then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried ; lay my bones beside his bones :
for the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria , shall surely come to pass .
and this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
and take with thee ten loaves , and cracknels , and a cruse of honey , and go to him : he shall tell thee what shall become of the child .
and Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . but Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
go , tell Jeroboam , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel ,
and rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind THY back :
him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the Lord hath spoken it .
arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when THY feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
and he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
and Jeroboam 's wife arose , and departed , and came to Tirzah : and when she came to the threshold of the door , the child died ;
and they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet .
and the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
and the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years : and he slept with this fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his stead .
and Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
and there were also sodomites in the land : and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem :
and he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
and king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and it was so , when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard bare them , and brought them back into the guard chamber .
now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and his mother 's name was Naamah an Ammonitess . and Abijam his son reigned in his stead .
three years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem :
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
now the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? and there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
and Abijam slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in the city of David : and ASA his son reigned in his stead .
and forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
and ASA did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , as did David his father .
and also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and ASA destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the Brook Kidron .
but the high places were not removed : nevertheless ASA 's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the Lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
and Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
so Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king ASA , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
and it came to pass , when Baasha heard thereof , that he left off building of Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah .
then king ASA made a proclamation throughout all Judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha had builded ; and king ASA built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
and Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of ASA king of Judah , and reigned over Israel two years .
and he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
and Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines ; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon .
even in the third year of ASA king of Judah did Baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead .
because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger .
now the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the third year of ASA king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah , twenty and four years .
and he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
then the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha , saying ,
Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust , and made thee prince over my people Israel ; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam , and hast made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
behold , I will take away the posterity of Baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make THY house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat .
now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
so Baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in Tirzah : and Elah his son reigned in his stead .
in the twenty and sixth year of ASA king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah , two years .
and his servant Zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him , as he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah .
and Zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of ASA king of Judah , and reigned in his stead .
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he slew all the house of Baasha : he left him not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of his kinsfolks , nor of his friends .
now the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the twenty and seventh year of ASA king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah . and the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which belonged to the Philistines .
and the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : wherefore all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
and Omri went up from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
and it came to pass , when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king 's house , and burnt the king 's house over him with fire , and died ,
for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
but the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath : so Tibni died , and Omri reigned .
for he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin , to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
so Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria : and Ahab his son reigned in his stead .
and in the thirty and eighth year of ASA king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel : and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years .
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshipped him .
and he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he had built in Samaria .
and Ahab made a grove ; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him .
get thee hence , and turn thee eastward , and hide thyself by the Brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
and it shall be , that thou shalt drink of the Brook ; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there .
so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord : for he went and dwelt by the Brook Cherith , that is before Jordan .
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the Brook .
and it came to pass after a while , that the Brook dried up , because there had been no rain in the land .
and the word of the Lord came unto him , saying ,
and as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thine hand .
and Elijah said unto her , Fear not ; go and do as thou hast said : but make me thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto me , and after make for thee and for THY son .
for thus saith the Lord God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth .
and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Elijah .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
and he said unto her , Give me THY son . and he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft , where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
and he cried unto the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn , by slaying her son ?
and he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried unto the Lord , and said , O Lord my God , I pray thee , let this child 's soul come into him again .
and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
and Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , THY son liveth .
and the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the Lord in THY mouth is truth .
and it came to pass after many days , that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year , saying , Go , shew thyself unto Ahab ; and I will send rain upon the earth .
and Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab . and there was a sore famine in Samaria .
and Ahab called Obadiah , which was the governor of his house . ( now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly :
for it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it : Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
and as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art thou that my lord Elijah ?
was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord , how I hid an hundred men of the Lord 's prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel .
then said Elijah unto the people , I , even I only , remain a prophet of the Lord ; but Baal 's prophets are four hundred and fifty men .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
and they cried aloud , and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets , till the blood gushed out upon them .
and it came to pass , when midday was past , and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and Elijah said unto all the people , Come near unto me . and all the people came near unto him . and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down .
and Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , unto whom the word of the Lord came , saying , Israel shall be THY name :
and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord : and he made a trench about the altar , as great as would contain two measures of seed .
and he put the wood in order , and cut the bullock in pieces , and laid him on the wood , and said , fill four barrels with water , and pour it on the burnt sacrifice , and on the wood .
and the water ran round about the altar ; and he filled the trench also with water .
then the fire of the Lord fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
and when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , The Lord , he is the God ; the Lord , he is the God .
and Elijah said unto them , Take the prophets of Baal ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon , and slew them there .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . and Ahab rode , and went to Jezreel .
and the hand of the Lord was on Elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel .
and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done , and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword .
and when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beer @-@ sheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there .
and he looked , and , behold , there was a cake baken on the coals , and a cruse of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and the angel of the Lord came again the second time , and touched him , and said , arise and eat ; because the journey is too great for thee .
and he arose , and did eat and drink , and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God .
and he came thither unto a cave , and lodged there ; and , behold , the word of the Lord came to him , and he said unto him , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entering in of the cave . and , behold , there came a voice unto him , and said , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
and it shall come to pass , that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal , and every mouth which hath not kissed him .
and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and chariots : and he went up and besieged Samaria , and warred against it .
and he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city , and said unto him , Thus saith Ben @-@ hadad ,
and the messengers came again , and said , Thus speaketh Ben @-@ hadad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Thou shalt deliver me THY silver , and THY gold , and THY wives , and THY children ;
yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of THY servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two : and after them he numbered all the people , even all the children of Israel , being seven thousand .
and they went out at noon . but Ben @-@ hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him .
and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben @-@ hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , There are men come out of Samaria .
and he said , Whether they be come out for peace , take them alive ; or whether they be come out for war , take them alive .
so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
and they slew every one his man : and the Syrians fled ; and Israel pursued them : and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen .
and the king of Israel went out , and smote the horses and chariots , and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter .
and the servants of the king of Syria said unto him , Their gods are gods of the hills ; therefore they were stronger than we ; but let us fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
and do this thing , Take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their rooms :
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that Ben @-@ hadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
and they pitched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day .
but the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left . and Ben @-@ hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner chamber .
and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the Lord , Smite me , I pray thee . and the man refused to smite him .
so the prophet departed , and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himself with ashes upon his face .
and as THY servant was busy here and there , he was gone . and the king of Israel said unto him , So shall THY judgment be ; thyself hast decided it .
and he hasted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets .
and the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased , and came to Samaria .
and Jezebel his wife said unto him , Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let thine heart be merry : I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite .
so she wrote letters in Ahab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with Naboth .
and set two men , sons of Belial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , Thou didst blaspheme God and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
they proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite , to take possession of it .
arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , which is in Samaria : behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , whither he is gone down to possess it .
behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away THY posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat .
but there was none like unto Ahab , which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord , whom Jezebel his wife stirred up .
and he did very abominably in following idols , according to all things as did the Amorites , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
and it came to pass , when Ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
and it came to pass in the third year , that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
and he said unto Jehoshaphat , Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth @-@ gilead ? and Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , I am as thou art , my people as THY people , my horses as THY horses .
and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , inquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and he said , Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne , and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
and the Lord said , Who shall persuade Ahab , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ gilead ? and one said on this manner , and another said on that manner .
now therefore , behold , the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these THY prophets , and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee .
but Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near , and smote Micaiah on the cheek , and said , Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee ?
and Micaiah said , behold , thou shalt see in that day , when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself .
and the king of Israel said , Take Micaiah , and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
and say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace .
but the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots , saying , Fight neither with small nor great , save only with the king of Israel .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , surely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Jehoshaphat cried out .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot , Turn thine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
so the king died , and was brought to Samaria ; and they buried the king in Samaria .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake .
now the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the Ivory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and Jehoshaphat the son of ASA began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and he walked in all the ways of ASA his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might that he shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and the remnant of the sodomites , which remained in the days of his father ASA , he took out of the land .
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold : but they went not ; for the ships were broken at Ezion @-@ geber .
and Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned two years over Israel .
and he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin :
for he served Baal , and worshipped him , and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite , arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say unto them , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inquire of Baal @-@ zebub the god of Ekron ?
now therefore thus saith the Lord , Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up , but shalt surely die . and Elijah departed .
and he said unto them , What manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty . and he went up to him : and , behold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he spake unto him , Thou man of God , the king hath said , Come down .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties : therefore let my life now be precious in THY sight .
and the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah , Go down with him : be not afraid of him . and he arose , and went down with him unto the king .
so he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken . and Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; because he had no son .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and it came to pass , when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind , that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal .
and Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither , so that they two went over on dry ground .
and he said , Thou hast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , behold , there appeared a chariot of fire , and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
and Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and smote the waters , and said , Where is the Lord God of Elijah ? and when he also had smitten the waters , they parted hither and thither : and Elisha went over .
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and when they came again to him , ( for he tarried at Jericho , ) he said unto them , did I not say unto you , Go not ?
and the men of the city said unto Elisha , behold , I pray thee , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord seeth : but the water is naught , and the ground barren .
and he went forth unto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Thus saith the Lord , I have healed these waters ; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land .
so the waters were healed unto this day , according to the saying of Elisha which he spake .
and he went up from thence unto Bethel : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mocked him , and said unto him , Go up , thou bald head ; go up , thou bald head .
and he turned back , and looked on them , and Cursed them in the name of the Lord . and there came forth two she bears out of the wood , and tare forty and two children of them .
now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and reigned twelve years .
and he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made .
nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster , and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs , and an hundred thousand rams , with the wool .
but it came to pass , when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
and Elisha said , As the Lord of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
but now bring me a minstrel . and it came to pass , when the minstrel played , that the hand of the Lord came upon him .
for thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord : he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand .
and ye shall smite every fenced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and it came to pass in the morning , when the meat offering was offered , that , behold , there came water by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
and when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on armour , and upward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward smiting the Moabites , even in their country .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead , and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall . and there was great indignation against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
then he said , Go , borrow thee vessels abroad of all THY neighbours , even empty vessels ; borrow not a few .
and when thou art come in , thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon THY sons , and shalt pour out into all those vessels , and thou shalt set aside that which is full .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and it fell on a day , that he came thither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her , according to the time of life .
and when the child was grown , it fell on a day , that he went out to his father to the reapers .
and when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , he sat on her knees till noon , and then died .
and she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut the door upon him , and went out .
and she called unto her husband , and said , Send me , I pray thee , one of the young men , and one of the asses , that I may run to the man of God , and come again .
then she saddled an ass , and said to her servant , Drive , and go forward ; Slack not THY riding for me , except I bid thee .
so she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel . and it came to pass , when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to Gehazi his servant , behold , yonder is that Shunammite :
and the mother of the child said , As the Lord liveth , and as THY soul liveth , I will not leave thee . and he arose , and followed her .
and when Elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the Lord .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and Elisha came again to Gilgal : and there was a dearth in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets .
and one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage : for they knew them not .
so they poured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out , and said , O thou man of God , there is death in the pot . and they could not eat thereof .
but he said , Then bring meal . and he cast it into the pot ; and he said , pour out for the people , that they may eat . and there was no harm in the pot .
now Naaman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria : he was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
and the Syrians had gone out by companies , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
and one went in , and told his lord , saying , Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy .
and it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent THY clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
so Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
and Elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and THY flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
are not Abana and Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? May I not wash in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
and the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha , behold now , the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us .
let us go , we pray thee , unto Jordan , and take thence every man a beam , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell . and he answered , Go ye .
but as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water : and he cried , and said , Alas , master ! for it was borrowed .
then the king of Syria warred against Israel , and took counsel with his servants , saying , In such and such a place shall be my camp .
and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel , saying , beware that thou pass not such a place ; for thither the Syrians are come down .
and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of , and saved himself there , not once nor twice .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and he said , Go and spy where he is , that I may send and fetch him . and it was told him , saying , behold , he is in Dothan .
therefore sent he thither horses , and chariots , and a great host : and they came by night , and compassed the city about .
and when they came down to him , Elisha prayed unto the Lord , and said , Smite this people , I pray thee , with blindness . and he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
and it came to pass , when they were come into Samaria , that Elisha said , Lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the Lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
and the king of Israel said unto Elisha , when he saw them , My father , shall I smite them ? shall I smite them ?
and it came to pass after this , that Ben @-@ hadad king of Syria gathered all his host , and went up , and besieged Samaria .
and there was a great famine in Samaria : and , behold , they besieged it , until an ass 's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a cab of dove 's Dung for five pieces of silver .
and as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall , there cried a woman unto him , saying , Help , my lord , O king .
and the king said unto her , What aileth thee ? and she answered , This woman said unto me , Give THY son , that we may eat him to day , and we will eat my son to morrow .
so we boiled my son , and did eat him : and I said unto her on the next day , Give THY son , that we may eat him : and she hath hid her son .
and it came to pass , when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his clothes ; and he passed by upon the wall , and the people looked , and , behold , he had sackcloth within upon his flesh .
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and he called the porters ; and they told it to the king 's house within .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the people went out , and spoiled the tents of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of the Lord .
and so it fell out unto him : for the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
and the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done .
and Elisha came to Damascus ; and Ben @-@ hadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hither .
and the king said unto Hazael , Take a present in thine hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of the Lord by him , saying , shall I recover of this disease ?
and it came to pass on the morrow , that he took a thick cloth , and dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Hazael reigned in his stead .
and in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign .
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab : for the daughter of Ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant 's sake , as he promised him to give him alway a light , and to his children .
in his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and made a king over themselves .
so Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him : and he rose by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots : and the people fled into their tents .
yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . then Libnah revolted at the same time .
and the rest of the acts of Joram , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
in the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign .
two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab : for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab .
and he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth @-@ gilead ; and the Syrians wounded Joram .
and Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , Gird up THY loins , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to Ramoth @-@ gilead :
and when thou comest thither , look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
then take the box of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , Thus saith the Lord , I have anointed thee king over Israel . then open the door , and flee , and tarry not .
so the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to Ramoth @-@ gilead .
and he arose , and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel .
and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab THY master , that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel .
for the whole house of Ahab shall perish : and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel :
and I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah :
and the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her . and he opened the door , and fled .
then they hasted , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trumpets , saying , Jehu is king .
so Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram . ( now Joram had kept Ramoth @-@ gilead , he and all Israel , because of Hazael king of Syria .
and the watchman told , saying , He came even unto them , and cometh not again : and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he driveth furiously .
and Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
and his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem , and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David .
and in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah .
and when Jehu was come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs .
and he said , throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
and when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , Go , see now this Cursed woman , and bury her : for she is a king 's daughter .
and they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as Dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel ; so that they shall not say , This is Jezebel .
and Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria . and Jehu wrote letters , and sent to Samaria , unto the rulers of Jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up Ahab 's children , saying ,
now as soon as this letter cometh to you , seeing your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fenced city also , and armour ;
look even out the best and meetest of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slew seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent him them to Jezreel .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Ye be righteous : behold , I conspired against my master , and slew him : but who slew all these ?
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord , which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab : for the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah .
so Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel , and all his great men , and his kinsfolks , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
and he arose and departed , and came to Samaria . and as he was at the Shearing house in the way ,
and when he came to Samaria , he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the Lord , which he spake to Elijah .
and Jehu sent through all Israel : and all the worshippers of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
and they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal , and burned them .
and they brake down the image of Baal , and brake down the house of Baal , and made it a draught house unto this day .
Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , Jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
but Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , which made Israel to sin .
now the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and Jehu slept with his fathers : and they buried him in Samaria . and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead .
and when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal .
and he was with her hid in the house of the Lord six years . and Athaliah did reign over the land .
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king .
and ye shall compass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that cometh within the ranges , let him be slain : and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in .
and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that should go out on the sabbath , and came to Jehoiada the priest .
and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David 's spears and shields , that were in the temple of the Lord .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temple of the Lord .
but Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said unto them , Have her forth without the ranges : and him that followeth her kill with the sword . for the priest had said , Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king 's house : and there was she slain .
and Jehoiada made a Covenant between the Lord and the king and the people that they should be the Lord 's people ; between the king also and the people .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Baal , and brake it down ; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . and the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord .
and he took the rulers over hundreds , and the captains , and the guard , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king 's house . and he sat on the throne of the kings .
and all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was in quiet : and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king 's house .
let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found .
but it was so , that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people , neither to repair the breaches of the house .
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the oversight of the house of the Lord : and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders , that wrought upon the house of the Lord ,
and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord :
but they gave that to the workmen , and repaired therewith the house of the Lord .
moreover they reckoned not with the men , into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen : for they dealt faithfully .
the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the Lord : it was the priests ' .
then Hazael king of Syria went up , and fought against Gath , and took it : and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem .
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and his servants arose , and made a conspiracy , and slew Joash in the house of Millo , which goeth down to Silla .
for Jozachar the son of Shimeath , and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , smote him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
in the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned seventeen years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @-@ hadad the son of Hazael , all their days .
( and the Lord gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel sin , but walked therein : and there remained the grove also in Samaria . )
neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria : and Joash his son reigned in his stead .
in the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned sixteen years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord ; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
and the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and Joash slept with his fathers ; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne : and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died . and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof .
and he said to the king of Israel , Put thine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and Elisha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and Elisha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
and it came to pass , as they were burying a man , that , behold , they spied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha : and when the man was let down , and touched the bones of Elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
so Hazael king of Syria died ; and Ben @-@ hadad his son reigned in his stead .
in the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , yet not like David his father : he did according to all things as Joash his father did .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places .
and it came to pass , as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand , that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father .
then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash , the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us look one another in the face .
but Amaziah would not hear . therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth @-@ shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and Judah was put to the worse before Israel ; and they fled every man to their tents .
and Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
and Jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem : and he fled to Lachish ; but they sent after him to Lachish , and slew him there .
and they brought him on horses : and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David .
and all the people of Judah took Azariah , which was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
in the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria , and reigned forty and one years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
for the Lord saw the affliction of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any helper for Israel .
and the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven : but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered Damascus , and Hamath , which belonged to Judah , for Israel , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah had done ;
save that the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places .
and the Lord smote the king , so that he was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house . and Jotham the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
and the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
so Azariah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him , and smote him before the people , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Zachariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
this was the word of the Lord which he spake unto Jehu , saying , Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah ; and he reigned a full month in Samaria .
for Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah , and came to Samaria , and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
and the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel , and reigned ten years in Samaria .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and Pul the king of Assyria came against the land : and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
and the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
in the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned two years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria , and reigned twenty years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
in the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , and took Ijon , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and Jonoah , and Kedesh , and Hazor , and Gilead , and Galilee , all the land of Naphtali , and carried them captive to Assyria .
and Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah .
and the rest of the acts of Pekah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
in the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord : he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
Howbeit the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places . he built the higher gate of the house of the Lord .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
in those days the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah .
and Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
in the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign .
twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yea , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel .
and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
at that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drave the Jews from Elath : and the Syrians came to Elath , and dwelt there unto this day .
so Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath @-@ pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am THY servant and THY son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria .
and the king of Assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to Kir , and slew Rezin .
and Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus : so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus .
and when the king was come from Damascus , the king saw the altar : and the king approached to the altar , and offered thereon .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
and he brought also the brasen altar , which was before the Lord , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the laver from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it , and put it upon a pavement of stones .
now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria ; and Hoshea became his servant , and gave him presents .
then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land , and went up to Samaria , and besieged it three years .
in the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
and walked in the statutes of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the Lord their God , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger :
for they served idols , whereof the Lord had said unto them , Ye shall not do this thing .
notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the Lord their God .
and they left all the commandments of the Lord their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God , but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made .
and the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord , and made them sin a great sin .
for the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they departed not from them ;
until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the prophets . so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day .
and the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Ava , and from Hamath , and from Sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel : and they possessed Samaria , and dwelt in the cities thereof .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
then the king of Assyria commanded , saying , Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land .
then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
and the men of Babylon made Succoth @-@ benoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima ,
so they feared the Lord , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared the Lord , and served their own gods , after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence .
with whom the Lord had made a Covenant , and charged them saying , Ye shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them :
but the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
and the statutes , and the ordinances , and the law , and the commandment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
and the Covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget ; neither shall ye fear other gods .
but the Lord your God ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies .
so these nations feared the Lord , and served their Graven images , both their children , and their children 's children : as did their fathers , so do they unto this day .
now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Abi , the daughter of Zachariah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father did .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the groves , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan .
he trusted in the Lord God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor any that were before him .
for he clave to the Lord , and departed not from following him , but kept his commandments , which the Lord commanded Moses .
and the Lord was with him ; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth : and he rebelled against the king of Assyria , and served him not .
he smote the Philistines , even unto Gaza , and the borders thereof , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel , that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria , and besieged it .
and at the end of three years they took it : even in the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
and the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria , and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes :
because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God , but transgressed his Covenant , and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded , and would not hear them , nor do them .
now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah , and took them .
and Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of Assyria .
and the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab @-@ shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem . and they went up and came to Jerusalem . and when they were come up , they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool , which is in the highway of the fuller 's field .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
and Rab @-@ shakeh said unto them , Speak ye now to Hezekiah , Thus saith the great king , the king of Assyria , What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
Thou sayest , ( but they are but vain words , ) I have counsel and strength for the war . now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised Reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it : so is Pharoah king of Egypt unto all that trust on him .
now therefore , I pray thee , give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria , and I will deliver thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rab @-@ shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spake , saying , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria :
thus saith the king , Let not Hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand :
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath , and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rab @-@ shakeh .
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eliakim , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
and they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
so Rab @-@ shakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
and when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , behold , he is come out to fight against thee : he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly : and shalt thou be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed ; as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar ?
where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivah ?
and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
and Hezekiah prayed before the Lord , and said , O Lord God of Israel , which dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
Lord , bow down thine ear , and hear : open , Lord , thine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent him to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , I beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places .
Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
but I know THY abode , and THY going out , and THY coming in , and THY rage against me .
because THY rage against me and THY tumult is come up into mine ears , therefore I will put my hook in THY nose , and my bridle in THY lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the Lord .
for I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and it came to pass that night , that the angel of the Lord went out , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and Esar @-@ haddon his son reigned in his stead .
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto the Lord , saying ,
I beseech thee , O Lord , remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in THY sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
and it came to pass , afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the Lord came to him , saying ,
and I will add unto THY days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and Hezekiah said unto Isaiah , What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day ?
and Isaiah said , This sign shalt thou have of the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forth ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
and Hezekiah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
and Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord : and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward , by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz .
at that time Berodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah : for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
and he said , What have they seen in thine house ? and Hezekiah answered , All the things that are in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah , Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken . and he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
and the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a conduit , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hephzi @-@ bah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for Baal , and made a grove , as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord said , In Jerusalem will I put my name .
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
and I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza : and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his father Manasseh did .
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshipped them :
and he forsook the Lord God of his fathers , and walked not in the way of the Lord .
and the servants of Amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his own house .
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza : and Josiah his son reigned in his stead .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jedidah , the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the Lord , saying ,
go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt faithfully .
and Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
and Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the Lord .
and Shaphan the scribe shewed the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book . and Shaphan read it before the king .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clothes .
and the king commanded Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Michaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asahiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
so Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asahiah , went unto Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ; ) and they communed with her .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
but to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , As touching the words which thou hast heard ;
behold therefore , I will gather thee unto THY fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into THY grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
and he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord , without Jerusalem , unto the Brook Kidron , and burned it at the Brook Kidron , and stamped it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people .
and he brake down the houses of the sodomites , that were by the house of the Lord , where the women wove hangings for the grove .
nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem , but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren .
and he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down , and brake them down from thence , and cast the dust of them into the Brook Kidron .
and he brake in pieces the images , and cut down the groves , and filled their places with the bones of men .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger , Josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars , and burned men 's bones upon them , and returned to Jerusalem .
and the king commanded all the people , saying , keep the passover unto the Lord your God , as it is written in the book of this Covenant .
surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
and like unto him was there no king before him , that turned to the Lord with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own sepulchre . and the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
and Pharaoh @-@ nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father , and turned his name to Jehoiakim , and took Jehoahaz away : and he came to Egypt , and died there .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zebudah , the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
and the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Moabites , and bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt .
Jehoiachin was Eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem three months . and his mother 's name was Nehushta , the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father had done .
at that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city , and his servants did besiege it .
and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord , as the Lord had said .
and the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father 's brother king in his stead , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
and the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho : and all his army were scattered from him .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
and they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ adan , captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , unto Jerusalem :
and he burnt the house of the Lord , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jerusalem , and every great man 's house burnt he with fire .
and all the army of the Chaldees , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carry away .
but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , did the Chaldees break in pieces , and carried the brass of them to Babylon .
and the pots , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and the firepans , and the bowls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
the two pillars , one sea , and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord ; the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door :
and Nebuzar @-@ adan captain of the guard took these , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah :
and the king of Babylon smote them , and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath . so Judah was carried away out of their land .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , ruler .
and when all the captains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethahiah , and Johanan the son of Careah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
and Gedaliah sware to them , and to their men , and said unto them , Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon ; and it shall be well with you .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah .
and all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chaldees .
and he spake kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon ;
and changed his prison garments : and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life .
and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .

so all Israel were reckoned by genealogies ; and , behold , they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah , who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression .
now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were , the Israelites , the priests , Levites , and the Nethinims .
and in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin , and of the children of Ephraim , and Manasseh ;
Uthai the son of Ammihud , the son of Omri , the son of Imri , the son of Bani , of the children of Pharez the son of Judah .

and Bakbakkar , Heresh , and Galal , and Mattaniah the son of Micah , the son of Zichri , the son of Asaph ;
and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of ASA , the son of Elkanah , that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites .
and the porters were , Shallum , and Akkub , and Talmon , and Ahiman , and their brethren : Shallum was the chief ;
who hitherto waited in the king 's gate eastward : they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi .
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past , and the Lord was with him .
and Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was Porter of the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation .
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office .
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the Lord , namely , the house of the tabernacle , by wards .
and their brethren , which were in their villages , were to come after seven days from time to time with them .
for these Levites , the four chief porters , were in their set office , and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God .
and they lodged round about the house of God , because the charge was upon them , and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them .
and certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels , that they should bring them in and out by tale .
some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanctuary , and the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
and some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices .
and Mattithiah , one of the Levites , who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite , had the set office over the things that were made in the pans .
and other of their brethren , of the sons of the Kohathites , were over the shewbread , to prepare it every sabbath .
and these are the singers , chief of the fathers of the Levites , who remaining in the chambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night .
and in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon , Jehiel , whose wife 's name was Maachah :
and Ner begat Kish ; and Kish begat Saul ; and Saul begat Jonathan , and Malchi @-@ shua , and Abinadab , and Esh @-@ baal .
and the son of Jonathan was Merib @-@ baal : and Merib @-@ baal begat Micah .

and Moza begat Binea ; and Rephaiah his son , Eleasah his son , Azel his son .
now the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
and the Philistines followed hard after Saul , and after his sons ; and the Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchi @-@ shua , the sons of Saul .
and the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers hit him , and he was wounded of the archers .
and when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise on the sword , and died .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities , and fled : and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
and when they had stripped him , they took his head , and his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to carry tidings unto their idols , and to the people .
they arose , all the valiant men , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel : and the Lord THY God said unto thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron ; and David made a Covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord ; and they anointed David king over Israel , according to the word of the Lord by Samuel .
and David and all Israel went to Jerusalem , which is Jebus ; where the Jebusites were , the inhabitants of the land .
and the inhabitants of Jebus said to David , Thou shalt not come hither . nevertheless David took the castle of Zion , which is the city of David .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel .
and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighties .
he was with David at pas @-@ dammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where was a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines .
and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel , and delivered it , and slew the Philistines ; and the Lord saved them by a great deliverance .
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
and David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , that is at the gate !
and the three brake through the host of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the Lord ,
and Abishai the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honourable than the two ; for he was their captain : howbeit he attained not to the first three .
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done many acts ; he slew two lionlike men of Moab : also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day .
behold , he was honourable among the thirty , but attained not to the first three : and David set him over his guard .
also the valiant men of the armies were , Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem ,
Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah , that pertained to the children of Benjamin , Benaiah the Pirathonite ,
the sons of Hashem the Gizonite , Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite ,
Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Berothite , the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah ,
Jediael the son of Shimri , and Joha his brother , the Tizite ,
Eliel the Mahavite , and Jeribai , and Joshaviah , the sons of Elnaam , and Ithmah the Moabite ,
now these are they that came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow , even of Saul 's brethren of Benjamin .
the chief was Ahiezer , then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite ; and Jeziel , and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth ; and Berachah , and Jehu the Antothite ,
and Ismaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Josabad the Gederathite ,
these were of the sons of Gad , captains of the host : one of the least was over an hundred , and the greatest over a thousand .
these are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had overflown all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
as he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh .
and they helped David against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host .
for at that time day by day there came to David to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of God .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to the word of the Lord .
the children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valour for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred .
and Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites , and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ;
and Zadok , a young man mighty of valour , and of his father 's house twenty and two captains .
and of the children of Benjamin , the kindred of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul .
and of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred , mighty men of valour , famous throughout the house of their fathers .
and of the half tribe of Manasseh Eighteen thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make David king .
and of the children of Issachar , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
of Zebulun , such as went forth to battle , expert in war , with all instruments of war , fifty thousand , which could keep rank : they were not of double heart .
and of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred .
and of Asher , such as went forth to battle , expert in war , forty thousand .
and on the other side of Jordan , of the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and of the half tribe of Manasseh , with all manner of instruments of war for the battle , an hundred and twenty thousand .
and there they were with David three days , eating and drinking : for their brethren had prepared for them .
and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds , and with every leader .
and let us bring again the Ark of our God to us : for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul .
and all the Congregation said that they would do so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
so David gathered all Israel together , from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hamath , to bring the Ark of God from Kirjath @-@ jearim .
and they carried the Ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab : and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart .
and David and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing , and with harps , and with psalteries , and with timbrels , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
and when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the Ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza , and he smote him , because he put his hand to the Ark : and there he died before God .
and David was displeased , because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzza : wherefore that place is called Perez @-@ uzza to this day .
so David brought not the Ark home to himself to the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ edom the Gittite .
and the Ark of God remained with the family of Obed @-@ edom in his house three months . and the Lord blessed the house of Obed @-@ edom , and all that he had .
now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and timber of cedars , with masons and carpenters , to build him an house .
and David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel , for his kingdom was lifted up on high , because of his people Israel .
now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem ; Shammua , and Shobab , Nathan , and Solomon ,
and when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David . and David heard of it , and went out against them .
and the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
and David inquired of God , saying , shall I go up against the Philistines ? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the Lord said unto him , Go up ; for I will deliver them into thine hand .
and when they had left their gods there , David gave a commandment , and they were burned with fire .
therefore David inquired again of God ; and God said unto him , Go not up after them ; turn away from them , and come upon them over against the mulberry trees .
and it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines .
David therefore did as God commanded him : and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer .
and the fame of David went out into all lands ; and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations .
and David made him houses in the city of David , and prepared a place for the Ark of God , and pitched for it a tent .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Lord unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
of the sons of Kohath ; Uriel the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Merari ; Asaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred and twenty :
of the sons of Gershom ; Joel the chief , and his brethren an hundred and thirty :
of the sons of Elizaphan ; Shemaiah the chief , and his brethren two hundred :
of the sons of Hebron ; Eliel the chief , and his brethren fourscore :
of the sons of Uzziel ; Amminadab the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twelve .
and David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , and Joel , Shemaiah , and Eliel , and Amminadab ,
and said unto them , Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites : sanctify yourselves , both ye and your brethren , that ye may bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it .
for because ye did it not at the first , the Lord our God made a breach upon us , for that we sought him not after the due order .
so the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel .
and the children of the Levites bare the Ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon , as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord .
and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ;
so the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass ;
and Zechariah , and Aziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , and Eliab , and Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with psalteries on Alamoth ;
and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obed @-@ edom , and Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps on the Sheminith to excel .
and Shebaniah , and Jehoshaphat , and Nethaneel , and Amasai , and Zechariah , and Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , did blow with the trumpets before the Ark of God : and Obed @-@ edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the Ark .
so David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obed @-@ edom with joy .
and it came to pass , when God helped the Levites that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord , that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams .
and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Levites that bare the Ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ephod of linen .
thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , making a noise with psalteries and harps .
and it came to pass , as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
so they brought the Ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God .
and when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord .
and he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
and he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark of the Lord , and to record , and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel :
Asaph the chief , and next to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah , and Obed @-@ edom : and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps ; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals ;
then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren .
give thanks unto the Lord , call upon his name , make known his deeds among the people .
sing unto him , sing psalms unto him , talk ye of all his wondrous works .
glory ye in his holy name : let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord .
he is the Lord our God ; his judgments are in all the earth .
and hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting Covenant ,
and when they went from nation to nation , and from one kingdom to another people ;
declare his glory among the heathen ; his marvellous works among all nations .
for great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised : he also is to be feared above all gods .
for all the gods of the people are idols : but the Lord made the heavens .
give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come before him : worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness .
fear before him , all the earth : the world also shall be stable , that it be not moved .
let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof : let the fields rejoice , and all that is therein .
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord , because he cometh to judge the earth .
and say ye , Save us , O God of our salvation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the heathen , that we may give thanks to THY holy name , and glory in THY praise .
so he left there before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord Asaph and his brethren , to minister before the Ark continually , as every day 's work required :
and Zadok the priest , and his brethren the priests , before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he commanded Israel ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the Lord , because his mercy endureth for ever ;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . and the sons of Jeduthun were porters .
and all the people departed every man to his house : and David returned to bless his house .
and it came to pass the same night , that the word of God came to Nathan , saying ,
for I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another .
now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , even from following the sheep , that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel :
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when THY days be expired that thou must go to be with THY fathers , that I will raise up THY seed after thee , which shall be of THY sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee :
but I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever : and his throne shall be established for evermore .
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak unto David .
and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God ; for thou hast also spoken of THY servant 's house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O Lord God .
O Lord , for THY servant 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
O Lord , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
therefore now , Lord , let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning THY servant and concerning his house be established for ever , and do as thou hast said .
for thou , O my God , hast told THY servant that thou wilt build him an house : therefore THY servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee .
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of THY servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , O Lord , and it shall be blessed for ever .
now after this it came to pass , that David smote the Philistines , and subdued them , and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines .
and David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath , as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates .
and David took from him a thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : David also houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them an hundred chariots .
and when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah , David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men .
then David put garrisons in Syria @-@ Damascus ; and the Syrians became David 's servants , and brought gifts . thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
and David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
likewise from Tibhath , and from Chun , cities of Hadarezer , brought David very much brass , wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah ;
them also king David dedicated unto the Lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from Edom , and from Moab , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from Amalek .
moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt Eighteen thousand .
and he put garrisons in Edom ; and all the Edomites became David 's servants . thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went .
so David reigned over all Israel , and executed judgment and justice among all his people .
and Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , recorder .
and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethiten of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Shavsha was scribe ;
now it came to pass after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his stead .
and the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother , and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will help thee .
and when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then Joab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
and David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set upon David 's head : and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city .
and it came to pass after this , that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines ; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were subdued .
and there was war again with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , whose spear staff was like a weaver 's beam .
and yet again there was war at Gath , where was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each foot : and he also was the son of the giant .
these were born unto the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword .
but Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them : for the king 's word was abominable to Joab .
and David said unto God , I have sinned greatly , because I have done this thing : but now , I beseech thee , do away the iniquity of THY servant ; for I have done very foolishly .
and the Lord spake unto Gad , David 's seer , saying ,
and David said unto Gad , I am in a great strait : let me fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for very great are his mercies : but let me not fall into the hand of man .
then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spake in the name of the Lord .
and Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons with him hid themselves . now Ornan was threshing wheat .
and as David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
and David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the Lord ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
and the Lord commanded the angel ; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof .
at that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
for the tabernacle of the Lord , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , were at that season in the high place at Gibeon .
but David could not go before it to inquire of God : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord .
then David said , This is the house of the Lord God , and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel .
and David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the joinings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God :
but the word of the Lord came to me , saying , Thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great wars : thou shalt not build an house unto my name , because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight .
he shall build an house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever .
now , my son , the Lord be with thee ; and prosper thou , and build the house of the Lord THY God , as he hath said of thee .
only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning Israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord THY God .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
now , behold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance : timber also and stone have I prepared ; and thou mayest add thereto .
moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work .
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . arise therefore , and be doing , and the Lord be with thee .
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying ,
so when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
of which , twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the Lord ; and six thousand were officers and judges :
moreover four thousand were porters ; and four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which I made , said David , to praise therewith .
and David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi , namely , Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
and the sons of Shimei were , Jahath , Zina , and Jeush , and Beriah . these four were the sons of Shimei .
and Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second : but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father 's house .
the sons of Amram ; Aaron and Moses : and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons for ever , to burn incense before the Lord , to minister unto him , and to bless in his name for ever .
now concerning Moses the man of God , his sons were named of the tribe of Levi .
and the sons of Eliezer were , Rehabiah the chief . and Eliezer had none other sons ; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many .
the sons of Merari ; Mahli , and Mushi . the sons of Mahli ; Eleazar , and Kish .
and Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters : and their brethren the sons of Kish took them .
these were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers ; even the chief of the fathers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and upward .
and also unto the Levites ; they shall no more carry the tabernacle , nor any vessels of it for the service thereof .
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts , and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the work of the service of the house of God ;
now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron ; Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
but Nadab and Abihu died before their father , and had no children : therefore Elezar and Ithamar executed the priest 's office .
and David distributed them , both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar , and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , according to their offices in their service .
and there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers , and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers .
thus were they divided by lot , one sort with another ; for the governors of the sanctuary , and governors of the house of God , were of the sons of Eleazar , and of the sons of Ithamar .
now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib , the second to Jedaiah ,
these were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the Lord , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him .
concerning Rehabiah : of the sons of Rehabiah , the first was Isshiah .
of the Izharites ; Shelomoth : of the sons of Shelomoth ; Jahath .
the brother of Michah was Isshiah : of the sons of Isshiah ; Zechariah .
the sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi : the sons of Jaaziah ; Beno .
the sons of Merari by Jaaziah ; Beno , and Shoham , and Zaccur , and Ibri .
the sons also of Mushi ; Mahli , and Eder , and Jerimoth . these were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers .
moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen according to their service was :
of the sons of Asaph ; Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asarelah , the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph , which prophesied according to the order of the king .
of Heman : the sons of Heman ; Bukkiah , Mattaniah , Uzziel , Shebuel , and Jerimoth , Hananiah , Hanani , Eliathah , Giddalti , and Romamti @-@ ezer , Joshbekashah , Mallothi , Hothir , and Mahazioth :
all these were the sons of Heman the king 's seer in the words of God , to lift up the Horn . and God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the Lord , with cymbals , psalteries , and harps , for the service of the house of God , according to the king 's order to Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
the third to Zaccur , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fourth to Izri , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fifth to Nethaniah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the sixth to Bukkiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the seventh to Jesharelah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the eighth to Jeshaiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the ninth to Mattaniah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the tenth to Shimei , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the eleventh to Azareel , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the twelfth to Hashabiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the thirteenth to Shubael , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fourteenth to Mattithiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fifteenth to Jeremoth , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the sixteenth to Hananiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the seventeenth to Joshbekashah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the eighteenth to Hanani , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the nineteenth to Mallothi , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the twentieth to Eliathah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the one and twentieth to Hothir , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the two and twentieth to Giddalti , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the three and twentieth to Mahazioth , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the four and twentieth to Romamti @-@ ezer , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve .
concerning the divisions of the porters : of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of kore , of the sons of Asaph .
moreover the sons of Obed @-@ edom were , Shemaiah the firstborn , Jehozabad the second , Joah the third , and Sacar the fourth , and Nethaneel the fifth ,
also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour .
also Hosah , of the children of Merari , had sons ; Simri the chief , ( for though he was not the firstborn , yet his father made him the chief ; )
among these were the divisions of the porters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the Lord .
and they cast lots , as well the small as the great , according to the house of their fathers , for every gate .
and the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah . then for Zechariah his son , a wise counseller , they cast lots ; and his lot came out northward .
these are the divisions of the porters among the sons of kore , and among the sons of Merari .
and of the Levites , Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
as concerning the sons of Laadan ; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan , chief fathers , even of Laadan the Gershonite , were Jehieli .
the sons of Jehieli ; Zetham , and Joel his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the Lord .
and Shebuel the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , was ruler of the treasures .
which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the Lord .
and all that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated ; and whosoever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shelomith , and of his brethren .
among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief , even among the Hebronites , according to the generations of his fathers . in the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for , and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead .
over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month .
and over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite , and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler : in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , a chief priest : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
this is that Benaiah , who was mighty among the thirty , and above the thirty : and in his course was Ammizabad his son .
the fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab , and Zebadiah his son after him : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the sixth captain for the sixth month was IRA the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .

the ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite , of the Benjamites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite , of the Zarhites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
furthermore over the tribes of Israel : the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri : of the Simeonites , Shephatiah the son of Maachah :
of Judah , Elihu , one of the brethren of David : of Issachar , Omri the son of Michael :

of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead , Iddo the son of Zechariah : of Benjamin , Jaasiel the son of Abner :
but David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens .
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David .
and over the king 's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah :
and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub :
and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite : over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite :
and over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baal @-@ hanan the Gederite : and over the cellars of oil was Joash :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai :
over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite : and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite :
and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite . all these were the rulers of the substance which was king David 's .
also Jonathan David 's uncle was a counseller , a wise man , and a scribe : and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king 's sons :
and Ahithophel was the king 's counseller : and Hushai the Archite was the king 's companion :
and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar : and the general of the king 's army was Joab .
but God said unto me , Thou shalt not build an house for my name , because thou hast been a man of war , and hast shed blood .
and of all my sons , ( for the Lord hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel .
and he said unto me , Solomon THY son , he shall build my house and my courts : for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever , if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments , as at this day .
take heed now ; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the chambers round about , of the treasuries of the house of God , and of the treasuries of the dedicated things :
also for the courses of the priests and the Levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every candlestick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the candlesticks of silver by weight , both for the candlestick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every candlestick .
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
also pure gold for the fleshhooks , and the bowls , and the cups : and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason ; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver :
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims , that spread out their wings , and covered the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord .
furthermore David the king said unto all the Congregation , Solomon my son , whom alone God hath chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the Lord God .
moreover , because I have set my affection to the house of my God , I have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which I have given to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house ,
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to overlay the walls of the houses withal :
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers . and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord ?
then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers of the king 's work , offered willingly ,
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass Eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite .
then the people rejoiced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy .
Thine , O Lord , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O Lord , and thou art exalted as head above all .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine own have we given thee .
for we are strangers before thee , and sojourners , as were all our fathers : our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is none abiding .
O Lord our God , all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand , and is all thine own .
O Lord God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of THY people , and prepare their heart unto thee :
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep THY commandments , THY testimonies , and THY statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and David said to all the Congregation , Now bless the Lord your God . and all the Congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the Lord , and the king .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord , on the morrow after that day , even a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him .
and all the princes , and the mighty men , and all the sons likewise of king David , submitted themselves unto Solomon the king .
and the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
and the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
and he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honour : and Solomon his son reigned in his stead .
now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Samuel the seer , and in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the book of Gad the seer ,
and Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and the Lord his God was with him , and magnified him exceedingly .
then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the Congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the Congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness .
but the Ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath @-@ jearim to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the brasen altar , that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the Congregation sought unto it .
and Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord , which was at the tabernacle of the Congregation , and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it .
now , O Lord God , let THY promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
give me now wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people : for who can judge this THY people , that is so great ?
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the Congregation , and reigned over Israel .
and the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king 's merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
and they fetched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
and Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the Lord , and an house for his kingdom .
and Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens , and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them .
and Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre , saying , As thou didst deal with David my father , and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein , even so deal with me .
send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon : for I know that THY servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon ; and , behold , my servants shall be with THY servants ,
and , behold , I will give to THY servants , the hewers that cut timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil .
then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , Because the Lord hath loved his people , he hath made thee king over them .
and now I have sent a cunning man , endued with understanding , of Huram my father 's ,
now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work .
then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah , where the Lord appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
and the porch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the height was an hundred and twenty : and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty : and the gold was gold of Parvaim .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the posts , and the walls thereof , and the doors thereof , with gold ; and graved cherubims on the walls .
and he made the most holy house , the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits : and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold .
and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work , and overlaid them with gold .
and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long : one wing of the one cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cubits also , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
and he reared up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
moreover he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits the length thereof , and twenty cubits the breadth thereof , and ten cubits the height thereof .
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid the doors of them with brass .
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end , over against the south .
and Huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basons . and Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
to wit , the two pillars , and the pommels , and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars ;
and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths ; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath , to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars .
he made also bases , and lavers made he upon the bases ;
the pots also , and the shovels , and the fleshhooks , and all their instruments , did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the Lord of bright brass .
in the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah .
thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance : for the weight of the brass could not be found out .
and Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also , and the tables whereon the shewbread was set ;
moreover the candlesticks with their lamps , that they should burn after the manner before the oracle , of pure gold ;
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished : and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of God .
then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel , unto Jerusalem , to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David , which is Zion .
Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
and they brought up the Ark , and the tabernacle of the Congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , these did the priests and the Levites bring up .
also king Solomon , and all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the Ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims :
for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark , and the cherubims covered the Ark and the staves thereof above .
and they drew out the staves of the Ark , that the ends of the staves were seen from the Ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is unto this day .
there was nothing in the Ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb , when the Lord made a Covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course :
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God .
and the king turned his face , and blessed the whole Congregation of Israel : and all the Congregation of Israel stood .
and he said , blessed be the Lord God of Israel , who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David , saying ,
now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
but the Lord said to David my father , Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house ; but THY son which shall come forth out of THY loins , he shall build the house for my name .
the Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken : for I am risen up in the room of David my father , and am set on the throne of Israel , as the Lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel .
and in it have I put the Ark , wherein is the Covenant of the Lord , that he made with the children of Israel .
and he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the Congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands :
and said , O Lord God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keepest Covenant , and shewest mercy unto THY servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
Thou which hast kept with THY servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with THY mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
now then , O Lord God of Israel , let THY word be verified , which thou hast spoken unto THY servant David .
but will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
have respect therefore to the prayer of THY servant , and to his supplication , O Lord my God , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which THY servant prayeth before thee :
that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put THY name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which THY servant prayeth toward this place .
Hearken therefore unto the supplications of THY servant , and of THY people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from THY dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
if a man sin against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house ;
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge THY servants , by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head ; and by justifying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
and if THY people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee ; and shall return and confess THY name , and pray and make supplication before thee in this house ;
then hear thou from the heavens , and forgive the sin of THY people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers .
when the heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; yet if they pray toward this place , and confess THY name , and turn from their sin , when thou dost afflict them ;
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of THY servants , and of THY people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon THY land , which thou hast given unto THY people for an inheritance .
if there be dearth in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blasting , or mildew , locusts , or caterpillers ; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land ; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be :
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man , or of all THY people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
then hear thou from heaven THY dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
that they may fear thee , to walk in THY ways , so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of THY people Israel , but is come from a far country for THY great name 's sake , and THY mighty hand , and THY stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
if THY people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for THY name ;
then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man which sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them over before their enemies , and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near ;
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive , and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity , saying , We have sinned , we have done amiss , and have dealt wickedly ;
if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , whither they have carried them captives , and pray toward their land , which thou gavest unto their fathers , and toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house which I have built for THY name :
then hear thou from the heavens , even from THY dwelling place , their prayer and their supplications , and maintain their cause , and forgive THY people which have sinned against thee .
now , my God , let , I beseech thee , thine eyes be open , and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
now therefore arise , O Lord God , into THY resting place , thou , and the Ark of THY strength : let THY priests , O Lord God , be clothed with salvation , and let THY saints rejoice in Goodness .
O Lord God , turn not away the face of thine anointed : remember the mercies of David THY servant .
now when Solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of the Lord filled the house .
and the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great Congregation , from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt .
and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the Goodness that the Lord had shewed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard THY prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if I shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if I command the locusts to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
if my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
for now have I chosen and sanctified this house , that my name may be there for ever : and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David THY father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
then will I stablish the throne of THY kingdom , according as I have covenanted with David THY father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel .
but if ye turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , wherein Solomon had built the house of the Lord , and his own house ,
that the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
and he built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the store cities , which he built in Hamath .
also he built Beth @-@ horon the upper , and Beth @-@ horon the nether , fenced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Baalath , and all the store cities that Solomon had , and all the chariot cities , and the cities of the horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and throughout all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
and these were the chief of king Solomon 's officers , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord , which he had built before the porch ,
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and until it was finished . so the house of the Lord was perfected .
then went Solomon to Ezion @-@ geber , and to Eloth , at the sea side in the land of Edom .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of THY wisdom :
Howbeit I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of THY wisdom was not told me : for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
happy are THY men , and happy are these THY servants , which stand continually before thee , and hear THY wisdom .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon .
and the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , which brought gold from Ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold ;
and king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target .
and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield . and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
moreover the king made a great throne of Ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two lions standing by the stays :
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
for the king 's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram : every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold , and silver , Ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines , and to the border of Egypt .
and the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance .
and they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
and Solomon slept with his fathers , and he was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
and it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
and they sent and called him . so Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam , saying ,
THY father made our yoke grievous : now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of THY father , and his heavy yoke that he put upon us , and we will serve thee .
and king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people ?
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , ease somewhat the yoke that THY father did put upon us ?
and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him , saying , Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee , saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , but make thou it somewhat lighter for us ; thus shalt thou say unto them , My little finger shall be thicker than my father 's loins .
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with Scorpions .
so Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day , as the king bade , saying , Come again to me on the third day .
so the king hearkened not unto the people : for the cause was of God , that the Lord might perform his word , which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
but as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
and when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam .
and he fortified the strong holds , and put captains in them , and store of victual , and of oil and wine .
and the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the Lord :
and he ordained him priests for the high places , and for the devils , and for the calves which he had made .
and after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers .
so they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
and Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife , and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse ;
and Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took Eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters . )
and Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
and he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin , unto every fenced city : and he gave them victual in abundance . and he desired many wives .
and it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the Lord , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the Lord ,
with twelve hundred chariots , and threescore thousand horsemen : and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt ; the Lubims , the Sukkiims , and the Ethiopians .
and he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah , and came to Jerusalem .
so Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king 's house .
and when the king entered into the house of the Lord , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
and when he humbled himself , the wrath of the Lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether : and also in Judah things went well .
and he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord .
now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet , and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ? and there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
he reigned three years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . and there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
and Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim , which is in mount Ephraim , and said , Hear me , thou Jeroboam , and all Israel ;
ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a Covenant of salt ?
yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
and there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Belial , and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted , and could not withstand them .
but as for us , the Lord is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests , which minister unto the Lord , are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites wait upon their business :
and , behold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
but Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them : so they were before Judah , and the ambushment was behind them .
and when Judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the Lord , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
then the men of Judah gave a shout : and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass , that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
and Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers .
and Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him , Bethel with the towns thereof , and Jeshnah with the towns thereof , and Ephrain with the towns thereof .
and the rest of the acts of Abijah , and his ways , and his sayings , are written in the story of the prophet Iddo .
so Abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and ASA his son reigned in his stead . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
and ASA did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God :
for he took away the altars of the strange gods , and the high places , and brake down the images , and cut down the groves :
and commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
and there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots ; and came unto Mareshah .
and ASA and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar : and the Ethiopians were overthrown , that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
and they smote all the cities round about Gerar ; for the fear of the Lord came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
they smote also the tents of cattle , and carried away sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to Jerusalem .
now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands be weak : for your work shall be rewarded .
so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of ASA .
and they offered unto the Lord the same time , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep .
and they entered into a Covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ;
that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
and they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
and all Judah rejoiced at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the Lord gave them rest round about .
and also concerning Maachah the mother of ASA the king , he removed her from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove : and ASA cut down her idol , and stamped it , and burnt it at the Brook Kidron .
but the high places were not taken away out of Israel : nevertheless the heart of ASA was perfect all his days .
and he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of ASA Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to ASA king of Judah .
then ASA brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben @-@ hadad king of Syria , that dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
and Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king ASA , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ maim , and all the store cities of Naphtali .
and it came to pass , when Baasha heard it , that he left off building of Ramah , and let his work cease .
then ASA the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha was building ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
and at that time Hanani the seer came to ASA king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the Lord THY God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand .
were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host , with very many chariots and horsemen ? yet , because thou didst rely on the Lord , he delivered them into thine hand .
for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . herein thou hast done foolishly : therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars .
then ASA was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and ASA oppressed some of the people the same time .
and , behold , the acts of ASA , first and last , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and ASA in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physicians .
and ASA slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign .
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which ASA his father had taken .
and the Lord was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not unto Baalim ;
but sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
therefore the Lord stablished the kingdom in his hand ; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents ; and he had riches and honour in abundance .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes , even to Ben @-@ hail , and to Obadiah , and to Zechariah , and to Nethaneel , and to Michaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah .
and with them he sent Levites , even Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehonathan , and Adonijah , and Tobijah , and Tob @-@ adonijah , Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , priests .
and they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of the Lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught the people .
and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah , so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and tribute silver ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats .
and Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly ; and he built in Judah castles , and cities of store .
and he had much business in the cities of Judah : and the men of war , mighty men of valour , were in Jerusalem .
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers : of Judah , the captains of thousands ; Adnah the chief , and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand .
and next to him was Jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand .
and next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself unto the Lord ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour .
and of Benjamin ; Eliada a mighty man of valour , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand .
and next him was Jehozabad , and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war .
these waited on the king , beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah .
and after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . and Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that he had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth @-@ gilead .
and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , inquire , I pray thee , at the word of the Lord to day .
and the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth @-@ gilead , and prosper : for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
again he said , Therefore hear the word of the Lord ; I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
and the Lord said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ramoth @-@ gilead ? and one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
now therefore , behold , the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these THY prophets , and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee .
then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and smote Micaiah upon the cheek , and said , Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee ?
and Micaiah said , behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself .
then the king of Israel said , Take ye Micaiah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
and say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on THY robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him , saying , Fight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of Israel .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the Lord helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
for it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek God .
and Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem : and he went out again through the people from Beer @-@ sheba to mount Ephraim , and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers .
and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah , city by city ,
and said to the judges , Take heed what ye do : for ye judge not for man , but for the Lord , who is with you in the judgment .
Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you ; take heed and do it : for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God , nor respect of persons , nor taking of gifts .
moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites , and of the priests , and of the chief of the fathers of Israel , for the judgment of the Lord , and for controversies , when they returned to Jerusalem .
and he charged them , saying , Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
it came to pass after this also , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them other beside the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
then there came some that told Jehoshaphat , saying , There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ; and , behold , they be Hazazon @-@ Tamar , which is En @-@ gedi .
and Jehoshaphat feared , and set himself to seek the Lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah .
and Judah gathered themselves together , to ask help of the Lord : even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord .
and Jehoshaphat stood in the Congregation of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of the Lord , before the new court ,
art not thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before THY people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham THY friend for ever ?
and they dwelt therein , and have built thee a sanctuary therein for THY name , saying ,
behold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of THY possession , which thou hast given us to inherit .
O our God , wilt thou not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us ; neither know we what to do : but our eyes are upon thee .
and all Judah stood before the Lord , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the Congregation ;
to morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the cliff of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the Brook , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord , worshipping the Lord .
and the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the children of the Korhites , stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high .
and when they began to sing and to praise , the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which were come against Judah ; and they were smitten .
for the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .
and when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah ; for there they blessed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel .
and Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
and he walked in the way of ASA his father , and departed not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish : and they made the ships in Ezion @-@ geber .
now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
and he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat , Azariah , and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
and their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fenced cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram ; because he was the firstborn .
now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father , he strengthened himself , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and divers also of the princes of Israel .
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
Howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of David , because of the Covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
in his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah , and made themselves a king .
then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots .
so the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . the same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand ; because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah thereto .
and there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet , saying , Thus saith the Lord God of David THY father , Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat THY father , nor in the ways of ASA king of Judah ,
behold , with a great plague will the Lord smite THY people , and THY children , and THY wives , and all THY goods :
moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians , that were near the Ethiopians :
and they came up into Judah , and brake into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , save Jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
and after all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease .
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . Howbeit they buried him in the city of David , but not in the sepulchres of the kings .
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
he also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab : for his mother was his counseller to do wickedly .
Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab : for they were his counsellers after the death of his father to his destruction .
he walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth @-@ gilead : and the Syrians smote Joram .
and he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . and Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel , because he was sick .
and the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram : for when he was come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi , whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab .
and it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them .
but when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah .
and in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into Covenant with him .
and they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they came to Jerusalem .
and all the Congregation made a Covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , behold , the king 's son shall reign , as the Lord hath said of the sons of David .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of the doors ;
and a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
but let none come into the house of the Lord , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
and the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he cometh in , and when he goeth out .
so the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go out on the sabbath : for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses .
moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king David 's , which were in the house of God .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the Lord :
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there .
and Jehoiada made a Covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the Lord 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord , that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in .
and he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
and all the people of the land rejoiced : and the city was quiet , after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword .
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Zibiah of Beer @-@ sheba .
and Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
and it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord .
for the sons of Athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim .
and at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the Lord .
and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
and the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord .
so the workmen wrought , and the work was perfected by them , and they set the house of God in his state , and strengthened it .
but Jehoiada waxed old , and was full of days when he died ; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
and they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king hearkened unto them .
and they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers , and served groves and idols : and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the Lord ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
and they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord .
thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . and when he died , he said , The Lord look upon it , and require it .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of Syria came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus .
and these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , but not with a perfect heart .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the Lord is not with Israel , to wit , with all the children of Ephraim .
but if thou wilt go , do it , be strong for the battle : God shall make thee fall before the enemy : for God hath power to help , and to cast down .
then Amaziah separated them , to wit , the army that was come to him out of Ephraim , to go home again : wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in great anger .
and Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the chidren of Seir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
now it came to pass , after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense unto them .
Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ?
then Amaziah king of Judah took advice , and sent to Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us see one another in the face .
Thou sayest , Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
but Amaziah would not hear ; for it came of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought after the gods of Edom .
so Joash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Beth @-@ shemesh , which belongeth to Judah .
and Judah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
and Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth @-@ shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed @-@ edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the Lord they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish : but they sent to Lachish after him , and slew him there .
and they brought him upon horses , and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah .
then all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah .
sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah did .
and he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosper .
and he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and brake down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod , and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
and God helped him against the Philistines , and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur @-@ baal , and the Mehunims .
and the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields , and spears , and helmets , and habergeons , and bows , and slings to cast stones .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he transgressed against the Lord his God , and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
and Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourscore priests of the Lord , that were valiant men :
and Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , did Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , write .
so Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a leper : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jerushah , the daughter of Zadok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Uzziah did : howbeit he entered not into the temple of the Lord . and the people did yet corruptly .
he built the high gate of the house of the Lord , and on the wall of Ophel he built much .
moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
and Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father :
for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel , and made also molten images for Baalim .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all valiant men ; because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers .
and Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah that was next to the king .
and the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the Lord your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the captives again , which ye have taken captive of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you .
then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the Congregation .
for Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria : but he helped him not .
and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord : this is that king Ahaz .
and Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
and in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods , and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers .
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and repaired them .
and he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them together into the east street ,
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel .
for , lo , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
now it is in mine heart to make a Covenant with the Lord God of Israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us .
my sons , be not now negligent : for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him , to serve him , and that ye should minister unto him , and burn incense .
then the Levites arose , Mahath the son of Amasai , and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the Kohathites : and of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi , and Azariah the son of Jehalelel : and of the Gershonites ; Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah :
and they gathered their brethren , and sanctified themselves , and came , according to the commandment of the king , by the words of the Lord , to cleanse the house of the Lord .
and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . and the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad into the Brook Kidron .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord : so they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days ; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
then they went in to Hezekiah the king , and said , We have cleansed all the house of the Lord , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread table , with all the vessels thereof .
moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the Lord .
then Hezekiah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the Lord .
so they killed the bullocks , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar : likewise , when they had killed the rams , they sprinkled the blood upon the altar : they killed also the lambs , and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar .
and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the Congregation ; and they laid their hands upon them :
and the Levites stood with the instruments of David , and the priests with the trumpets .
and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
and all the Congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded : and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
and when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves , and worshipped .
moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . and they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshipped .
and the number of the burnt offerings , which the Congregation brought , was threescore and ten bullocks , an hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord .
and also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of the Lord was set in order .
and Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the Congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
and be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers , who therefore gave them up to desolation , as ye see .
now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the Lord , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the Lord your God , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the Lord .
and there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great Congregation .
and they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the Brook Kidron .
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
for there were many in the Congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the Lord .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
for Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the Congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the Congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
and all the Congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the Congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
so there was great joy in Jerusalem : for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem .
then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people : and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place , even unto heaven .
he appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the Lord .
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord .
and concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord their God , and laid them by heaps .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
and when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they blessed the Lord , and his people Israel .
then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord ; and they prepared them ,
and thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah , and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the Lord our God to help us , and to fight our battles . and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
after this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem , ( but he himself laid siege against Lachish , and all his power with him , ) unto Hezekiah king of Judah , and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem , saying ,
Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and they spake against the God of Jerusalem , as against the gods of the people of the earth , which were the work of the hands of man .
and for this cause Hezekiah the king , and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz , prayed and cried to heaven .
thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all other , and guided them on every side .
and many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem , and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah : so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth .
in those days Hezekiah was sick to the death , and prayed unto the Lord : and he spake unto him , and he gave him a sign .
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
and Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant jewels ;
storehouses also for the increase of corn , and wine , and oil ; and stalls for all manner of beasts , and cotes for flocks .
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . and Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his Goodness , behold , they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
and Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem :
but did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , like unto the abominations of the heathen , whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for Baalim , and made groves , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
also he built altars in the house of the Lord , whereof the Lord had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom : also he observed times , and used enchantments , and used witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with wizards : he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger .
so Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err , and to do worse than the heathen , whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel .
and the Lord spake to Manasseh , and to his people : but they would not hearken .
Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
and when he was in affliction , he besought the Lord his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
and prayed unto him : and he was intreated of him , and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God .
and he took away the strange gods , and the idol out of the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
and he repaired the altar of the Lord , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel .
now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer unto his God , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned two years in Jerusalem .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
and humbled not himself before the Lord , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but Amon trespassed more and more .
and his servants conspired against him , and slew him in his own house .
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and so did he in the cities of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and Simeon , even unto Naphtali , with their mattocks round about .
and when he had broken down the altars and the groves , and had beaten the Graven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the Lord his God .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house :
even to the artificers and builders gave they it , to buy hewn stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed .
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses .
and Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . and Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan .
and Shaphan carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to THY servants , they do it .
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and to the hand of the workmen .
then Shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book . and Shaphan read it before the king .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he rent his clothes .
and the king commanded Hilkiah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
and Hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college : ) and they spake to her to that effect .
thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
and as for the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of the Lord , so shall ye say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard ;
and he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the Covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem : and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
and he set the priests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord ,
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Levites .
so kill the passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses .
and Josiah gave to the people , of the flock , lambs and kids , all for the passover offerings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullocks : these were of the king 's substance .
Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethaneel , his brethren , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , chief of the Levites , gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle , and five hundred oxen .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the Lord , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the oxen .
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
so all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day , to keep the passover , and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord , according to the commandment of king Josiah .
after all this , when Josiah had prepared the temple , Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates : and Josiah went out against him .
his servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had ; and they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers . and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
and Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in Israel : and , behold , they are written in the lamentations .
now the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his Goodness , according to that which was written in the law of the Lord ,
and his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and made him king in his father 's stead in Jerusalem .
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months in Jerusalem .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God .
against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to Babylon .
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord .
and when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God , and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord .
and he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel .
moreover all the chief of the priests , and the people , transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen ; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem .
and the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up betimes , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
but they mocked the messengers of God , and despised his words , and misused his prophets , until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people , till there was no remedy .
and all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes ; all these he brought to Babylon .
and they burnt the house of God , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof .
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled , the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
thus saith Cyrus king of Persia , The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
who is there among you of all his people ? his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of the Lord God of Israel , ( he is the God , ) which is in Jerusalem .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity , of those which had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon , and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah , every one unto his city ;
the children of Parosh , two thousand an hundred seventy and two .
the children of Shephatiah , three hundred seventy and two .
the children of Arah , seven hundred seventy and five .
the children of Pahath @-@ moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand eight hundred and twelve .

the children of Azgad , a thousand two hundred twenty and two .
the children of Adonikam , six hundred sixty and six .
the children of Bigvai , two thousand fifty and six .
the children of Adin , four hundred fifty and four .
the children of Ater of Hezekiah , ninety and eight .
the children of Bezai , three hundred twenty and three .
the children of Jorah , an hundred and twelve .
the children of Hashum , two hundred twenty and three .
the children of Gibbar , ninety and five .
the children of Azmaveth , forty and two .
the children of Kirjath @-@ arim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred and forty and three .
the children of Ramah and Geba , six hundred twenty and one .
the men of Michmas , an hundred twenty and two .
the children of Magbish , an hundred fifty and six .
the children of the other Elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
the children of Lod , Hadid , and Ono , seven hundred twenty and five .
the children of Jericho , three hundred forty and five .
the children of Senaah , three thousand and six hundred and thirty .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
the children of Immer , a thousand fifty and two .
the children of Pashur , a thousand two hundred forty and seven .
the children of Harim , a thousand and seventeen .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy and four .
the singers : the children of Asaph , an hundred twenty and eight .
the children of the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
the Nethinims : the children of Ziha , the children of Hasupha , the children of Tabbaoth ,
the children of Keros , the children of Siaha , the children of Padon ,
the children of Lebanah , the children of Hagabah , the children of Akkub ,
the children of Hagab , the children of Shalmai , the children of Hanan ,
the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar , the children of Reaiah ,
the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda , the children of Gazzam ,
the children of Uzza , the children of Paseah , the children of Besai ,
the children of Asnah , the children of Mehunim , the children of Nephusim ,
the children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur ,
the children of Bazluth , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha ,
the children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Thamah ,
the children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Peruda ,
the children of Jaalah , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Ami .
all the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred ninety and two .
and these were they which went up from Tel @-@ melah , Tel @-@ harsa , Cherub , Addan , and Immer : but they could not shew their father 's house , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
and of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name :
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim .
the whole Congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
and they set the altar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
they kept also the feast of tabernacles , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the custom , as the duty of every day required ;
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering , both of the new moons , and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated , and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord .
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord . but the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid .
then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , together , to set forward the workmen in the house of God : the sons of Henadad , with their sons and their brethren the Levites .
but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people : for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard afar off .
now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ,
and hired counsellers against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
and in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
and in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of their companions , unto Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue , and interpreted in the Syrian tongue .
then wrote Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions ; the Dinaites , the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Susanchites , the Dehavites , and the Elamites ,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over , and set in the cities of Samaria , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Artaxerxes the king ; Thy servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be builded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ;
then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor , and to Shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria , and unto the rest beyond the river , Peace , and at such a time .
and I commanded , and search hath been made , and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein .
there have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem , which have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tribute , and custom , was paid unto them .
give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease , and that this city be not builded , until another commandment shall be given from me .
take heed now that ye fail not to do this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
now when the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem . so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
then said we unto them after this manner , What are the names of the men that make this building ?
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar @-@ boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto Darius the king :
they sent a letter unto him , wherein was written thus ; unto Darius the king , all peace .
we asked their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem , and brought them into the temple of Babylon , those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered unto one , whose name was Sheshbazzar , whom he had made governor ;
and said unto him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be builded in his place .
then came the same Sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem : and since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
then Darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rolls , where the treasures were laid up in Babylon .
and there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sons .
then Tatnai , governor on this side the river , Shethar @-@ boznai , and their companions , according to that which Darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king .
and the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy ,
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
and they set the priests in their divisions , and the Levites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
for the priests and the Levites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
and the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the Lord God of Israel , did eat ,
and there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , unto Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king .
and he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord , and of his statutes to Israel .
Artaxerxes , king of kings , unto Ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the God of heaven , perfect peace , and at such a time .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king , and of his seven counsellers , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of THY God which is in thine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the God of Israel , whose habitation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks , rams , lambs , with their meat offerings and their drink offerings , and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee , and to THY brethren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your God .
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of THY God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of THY God , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
unto an hundred talents of silver , and to an hundred measures of wheat , and to an hundred baths of wine , and to an hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing how much .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we certify you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , singers , porters , Nethinims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
and whosoever will not do the law of THY God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
blessed be the Lord God of our fathers , which hath put such a thing as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem :
these are now the chief of their fathers , and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon , in the reign of Artaxerxes the king .
of the sons of Phinehas ; Gershom : of the sons of Ithamar ; Daniel : of the sons of David ; Hattush .
of the sons of Shechaniah , of the sons of Pharosh ; Zechariah : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
of the sons of Pahath @-@ moab ; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah , and with him two hundred males .
of the sons of Shechaniah ; the son of Jahaziel , and with him three hundred males .
of the sons also of Adin ; Ebed the son of Jonathan , and with him fifty males .
and of the sons of Elam ; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah , and with him seventy males .
and of the sons of Shephatiah ; Zebadiah the son of Michael , and with him fourscore males .
of the sons of Joab ; Obadiah the son of Jehiel , and with him two hundred and Eighteen males .
and of the sons of Shelomith ; the son of Josiphiah , and with him an hundred and threescore males .
and of the sons of Bebai ; Zechariah the son of Bebai , and with him twenty and eight males .
and of the sons of Azgad ; Johanan the son of Hakkatan , and with him an hundred and ten males .
and of the last sons of Adonikam , whose names are these , Eliphelet , Jeiel , and Shemaiah , and with them threescore males .
of the sons also of Bigvai ; Uthai , and Zabbud , and with them seventy males .
and I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava ; and there abode we in tents three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi .
then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
and Hashabiah , and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari , his brethren and their sons , twenty ;
also of the Nethinims , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinims : all of them were expressed by name .
then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests , Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them ,
and weighed unto them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his counsellers , and his lords , and all Israel there present , had offered :
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels an hundred talents , and of gold an hundred talents ;
and I said unto them , Ye are holy unto the Lord ; the vessels are holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord God of your fathers .
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the Lord .
so took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
by number and by weight of every one : and all the weight was written at that time .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of the transgression of those that had been carried away ; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God .
and said , O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens .
and Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
then arose Ezra , and made the chief priests , the Levites , and all Israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . and they sware .
and they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
and that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the Congregation of those that had been carried away .
now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
then all the Congregation answered and said with a loud voice , As thou hast said , so must we do .
only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter : and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them .
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass .
and of the sons of Immer ; Hanani , and Zebadiah .
and of the sons of Harim ; Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
and of the sons of Pashur ; Elioenai , Maaseiah , Ishmael , Nethaneel , Jozabad , and Elasah .
also of the Levites ; Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah , ( the same is Kelita , ) Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Parosh ; Ramiah , and Jeziah , and Malchiah , and Miamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
and of the sons of Elam ; Mattaniah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , and Abdi , and Jeremoth , and Eliah .
and of the sons of Zattu ; Elioenai , Eliashib , Mattaniah , and Jeremoth , and Zabad , and Aziza .
of the sons also of Bebai ; Jehohanan , Hananiah , Zabbai , and Athlai .
and of the sons of Bani ; Meshullam , Malluch , and Adaiah , Jashub , and Sheal , and Ramoth .
and of the sons of Pahath @-@ moab ; Adna , and Chelal , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattaniah , Bezaleel , and Binnui , and Manasseh .
all these had taken strange wives : and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
the words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . and it came to pass in the month Chisleu , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the palace ,
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and they said unto me , The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach : the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire .
and it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and wept , and mourned certain days , and fasted , and prayed before the God of heaven ,
and said , I beseech thee , O Lord God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
we have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou commandedst THY servant Moses .
remember , I beseech thee , the word that thou commandedst THY servant Moses , saying , If ye transgress , I will scatter you abroad among the nations :
but if ye turn unto me , and keep my commandments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven , yet will I gather them from thence , and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
now these are THY servants and THY people , whom thou hast redeemed by THY great power , and by THY strong hand .
and it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine , and gave it unto the king . now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence .
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till I come into Judah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
and I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem : neither was there any beast with me , save the beast that I rode upon .
then I went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
then went I up in the night by the Brook , and viewed the wall , and turned back , and entered by the gate of the valley , and so returned .
and the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
but when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they laughed us to scorn , and despised us , and said , What is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they builded the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it , unto the tower of Hananeel .
and next unto him builded the men of Jericho . and next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri .
but the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build , who also laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . and next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . and next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
and next unto them the Tekoites repaired ; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord .
moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon , and of Mizpah , unto the throne of the governor on this side the river .
next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , of the goldsmiths . next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries , and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall .
and next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem .
and next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph , even over against his house . and next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah .
Malchijah the son of Harim , and Hashub the son of Pahath @-@ moab , repaired the other piece , and the tower of the furnaces .
and next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , he and his daughters .
the valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the Dung gate .
but the Dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Beth @-@ haccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
after him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of the half part of Beth @-@ zur , unto the place over against the sepulchres of David , and to the pool that was made , and unto the house of the mighty .
and next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall .
after him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece , from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
after him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .
after him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece , from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall , even unto the corner .
Palal the son of Uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel , unto the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that lieth out .
after them the Tekoites repaired another piece , over against the great tower that lieth out , even unto the wall of Ophel .
after them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house . after him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah , the keeper of the east gate .
after him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah , and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph , another piece . after him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber .
and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall , he was wroth , and took great indignation , and mocked the Jews .
now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , Even that which they build , if a Fox go up , he shall even break down their stone wall .
and cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
so built we the wall ; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof : for the people had a mind to work .
but it came to pass , that when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and the Arabians , and the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites , heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth ,
nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
and our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the work to cease .
and it came to pass , that when the Jews which dwelt by them came , they said unto us ten times , From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the habergeons ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
they which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet , resort ye thither unto us : our God shall fight for us .
so we laboured in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared .
likewise at the same time said I unto the people , Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labour on the day .
so neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving that every one put them off for washing .
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews .
for there were that said , We , our sons , and our daughters , are many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live .
some also there were that said , We have mortgaged our lands , vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn , because of the dearth .
also I said , It is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies ?
I likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might exact of them money and corn : I pray you , let us leave off this usury .
Yea , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
think upon me , my God , for good , according to all that I have done for this people .
that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono . but they thought to do me mischief .
and I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work , so that I cannot come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave it , and come down to you ?
yet they sent unto me four times after this sort ; and I answered them after the same manner .
then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ;
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Judah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
then I sent unto him , saying , There are no such things done as thou sayest , but thou feignest them out of thine own heart .
and I said , Should such a man as I flee ? and who is there , that , being as I am , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul , in fifty and two days .
moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came unto them .
for there were many in Judah sworn unto him , because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
that I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
now the city was large and great : but the people were few therein , and the houses were not builded .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the captivity , of those that had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah , every one unto his city ;
who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
the children of Parosh , two thousand an hundred seventy and two .
the children of Shephatiah , three hundred seventy and two .
the children of Arah , six hundred fifty and two .
the children of Pahath @-@ moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand and eight hundred and Eighteen .
the children of Elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
the children of Zattu , eight hundred forty and five .

the children of Bebai , six hundred twenty and eight .
the children of Azgad , two thousand three hundred twenty and two .
the children of Adonikam , six hundred threescore and seven .
the children of Bigvai , two thousand threescore and seven .
the children of Adin , six hundred fifty and five .
the children of Ater of Hezekiah , ninety and eight .
the children of Hashum , three hundred twenty and eight .
the children of Bezai , three hundred twenty and four .
the children of Hariph , an hundred and twelve .
the men of Bethlehem and Netophah , an hundred fourscore and eight .
the men of Beth @-@ azmaveth , forty and two .
the men of Kirjath @-@ jearim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred forty and three .
the men of Ramah and Geba , six hundred twenty and one .
the children of the other Elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
the children of Jericho , three hundred forty and five .
the children of Lod , Hadid , and Ono , seven hundred twenty and one .
the children of Senaah , three thousand nine hundred and thirty .
the priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
the children of Immer , a thousand fifty and two .
the children of Pashur , a thousand two hundred forty and seven .
the children of Harim , a thousand and seventeen .
the Levites : the children of Jeshua , of Kadmiel , and of the children of Hodevah , seventy and four .
the singers : the children of Asaph , an hundred forty and eight .
the porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , an hundred thirty and eight .
the Nethinims : the children of Ziha , the children of Hashupha , the children of Tabbaoth ,
the children of Keros , the children of Sia , the children of Padon ,
the children of Lebana , the children of Hagaba , the children of Shalmai ,
the children of Hanan , the children of Giddel , the children of Gahar ,
the children of Reaiah , the children of Rezin , the children of Nekoda ,
the children of Gazzam , the children of Uzza , the children of Phaseah ,
the children of Besai , the children of Meunim , the children of Nephishesim ,
the children of Bakbuk , the children of Hakupha , the children of Harhur ,
the children of Bazlith , the children of Mehida , the children of Harsha ,
the children of Barkos , the children of Sisera , the children of Tamah ,
the children of Neziah , the children of Hatipha .
the children of Solomon 's servants : the children of Sotai , the children of Sophereth , the children of Perida ,
the children of Jaala , the children of Darkon , the children of Giddel ,
the children of Shephatiah , the children of Hattil , the children of Pochereth of Zebaim , the children of Amon .
all the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon 's servants , were three hundred ninety and two .
and these were they which went up also from Telmelah , Telharesha , Cherub , Addon , and Immer : but they could not shew their father 's house , nor their seed , whether they were of Israel .
the children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty and two .
and of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai , which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but it was not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
and the Tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim .
the whole Congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
beside their manservants and their maidservants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver .
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand pound of silver , and threescore and seven priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the Nethinims , and all Israel , dwelt in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of Israel were in their cities .
and Ezra the priest brought the law before the Congregation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and Ezra blessed the Lord , the great God . and all the people answered , Amen , Amen , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the ground .
also Jeshua , and Bani , and Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodijah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , Pelaiah , and the Levites , caused the people to understand the law : and the people stood in their place .
so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly , and gave the sense , and caused them to understand the reading .
so the Levites stilled all the people , saying , Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the Levites , unto Ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law .
and they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month :
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
and all the Congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths , and sat under the booths : for since the days of Jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so . and there was very great gladness .
also day by day , from the first day unto the last day , he read in the book of the law of God . and they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according unto the manner .
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackclothes , and earth upon them .
and the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confessed , and worshipped the Lord their God .
then stood up upon the stairs , of the Levites , Jeshua , and Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Chenani , and cried with a loud voice unto the Lord their God .
Thou art the Lord the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ;
and didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heardest their cry by the Red sea ;
and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharoah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them . so didst thou get thee a name , as it is this day .
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai , and spakest with them from heaven , and gavest them right judgments , and true laws , good statutes and commandments :
and madest known unto them THY holy sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and laws , by the hand of Moses THY servant :
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them .
but they and our fathers dealt proudly , and hardened their necks , and hearkened not to THY commandments ,
Yea , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , This is THY God that brought thee up out of Egypt , and had wrought great provocations ;
yet thou in THY manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness : the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew them light , and the way wherein they should go .
Thou gavest also THY good spirit to instruct them , and withheldest not THY manna from their mouth , and gavest them water for their thirst .
Yea , forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness , so that they lacked nothing ; their clothes waxed not old , and their feet swelled not .
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Sihon , and the land of the king of Heshbon , and the land of Og king of Bashan .
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast THY law behind their backs , and slew THY prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
yet many years didst thou forbear them , and testifiedst against them by THY spirit in THY prophets : yet would they not give ear : therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
nevertheless for THY great mercies ' sake thou didst not utterly consume them , nor forsake them ; for thou art a gracious and merciful God .
Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for thou hast done right , but we have done wickedly :
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept THY law , nor hearkened unto THY commandments and THY testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
for they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in THY great Goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
behold , we are servants this day , and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it :
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
now those that sealed were , Nehemiah , the Tirshatha , the son of Hachaliah , and Zidkijah ,
and the Levites : both Jeshua the son of Azaniah , Binnui of the sons of Henadad , Kadmiel ;
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground , and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the Lord :
also the firstborn of our sons , and of our cattle , as it is written in the law , and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks , to bring to the house of our God , unto the priests that minister in the house of our God :
and the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites , when the Levites take tithes : and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
and the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts to dwell in other cities .
and the people blessed all the men , that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem .
and at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah , and of the children of Benjamin . of the children of Judah ; Athaiah the son of Uzziah , the son of Zechariah , the son of Amariah , the son of Shephatiah , the son of Mahalaleel , of the children of Perez ;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch , the son of Col @-@ hozeh , the son of Hazaiah , the son of Adaiah , the son of Joiarib , the son of Zechariah , the son of Shiloni .
all the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men .
and these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jesaiah .
and Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer : and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city .
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , was the ruler of the house of God .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and Adaiah the son of Jeroham , the son of Pelaliah , the son of Amzi , the son of Zechariah , the son of Pashur , the son of Malchiah ,
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and Amashai the son of Azareel , the son of Ahasai , the son of Meshillemoth , the son of Immer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was Zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
also of the Levites : Shemaiah the son of Hashub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Bunni ;
and Shabbethai and Jozabad , of the chief of the Levites , had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God .
all the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four .
and the residue of Israel , of the priests , and the Levites , were in all the cities of Judah , every one in his inheritance .
for it was the king 's commandment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day .
and Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel , of the children of Zerah the son of Judah , was at the king 's hand in all matters concerning the people .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath @-@ arba , and in the villages thereof , and at Dibon , and in the villages thereof , and at Jekabzeel , and in the villages thereof ,
and at Ziklag , and at Mekonah , and in the villages thereof ,
Zanoah , Adullam , and in their villages , at Lachish , and the fields thereof , at Azekah , and in the villages thereof . and they dwelt from Beer @-@ sheba unto the valley of Hinnom .
the children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash , and Aija , and Bethel , and in their villages ,
now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua : Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra ,
Sallu , Amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah . these were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua .
moreover the Levites : Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Sherebiah , Judah , and Mattaniah , which was over the Thanksgiving , he and his brethren .
and in the days of Joiakim were priests , the chief of the fathers : of Seraiah , Meraiah ; of Jeremiah , Hananiah ;
the Levites in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , were recorded chief of the fathers : also the priests , to the reign of Darius the Persian .
the sons of Levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
and the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
these were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest , the scribe .
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem , and from the villages of Netophathi ;
and the priests and the Levites purified themselves , and purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the Dung gate :
and after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah ,
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph :
and his brethren , Shemaiah , and Azarael , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and Ezra the scribe before them .
and at the fountain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even unto the water gate eastward .
and from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God , and I , and the half of the rulers with me :
and Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . and the singers sang loud , with Jezrahiah their overseer .
and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God , and the ward of the purification , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
for in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and Thanksgiving unto God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the Congregation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing .
now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
and before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah :
but in all this time was not I at Jerusalem : for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
and it grieved me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber .
then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
and I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ? and I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
there dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
in those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod , of Ammon , and of Moab :
and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
and I contended with them , and Cursed them , and smote certain of them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , saying , Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons , nor take their daughters unto your sons , or for yourselves .
and one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
remember them , O my God , because they have defiled the priesthood , and the Covenant of the priesthood , and of the Levites .
thus cleansed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites , every one in his business ;
now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , ( this is Ahasuerus which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
and the drinking was according to the law ; none did compel : for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
but the queen Vashti refused to come at the king 's commandment by his chamberlains : therefore was the king very wroth , and his anger burned in him .
then the king said to the wise men , which knew the times , ( for so was the king 's manner toward all that knew law and judgment :
and Memucan answered before the king and the princes , Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
and the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of Memucan :
after these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjamite ;
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred : for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it .
and Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women 's house , to know how Esther did , and what should become of her .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
so Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
and the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then Mordecai sat in the king 's gate .
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people ; as Mordecai had charged her : for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai , like as when she was brought up with him .
in those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
and the thing was known to Mordecai , who told it unto Esther the queen ; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai 's name .
and when Inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
after these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes that were with him .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
then the king 's servants , which were in the king 's gate , said unto Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king 's commandment ?
and when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , then was Haman full of wrath .
and he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even the people of Mordecai .
if it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king 's treasuries .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
and the king said unto Haman , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
the posts went out , being hastened by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given in Shushan the palace . and the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city Shushan was perplexed .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
and came even before the king 's gate : for none might enter into the king 's gate clothed with sackcloth .
and in every province , whithersoever the king 's commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
so Esther 's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
so Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city , which was before the king 's gate .
and Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king 's treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
again Esther spake unto Hatach , and gave him commandment unto Mordecai ;
now it came to pass on the third day , that Esther put on her royal apparel , and stood in the inner court of the king 's house , over against the king 's house : and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
and it was so , when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand . so Esther drew near , and touched the top of the sceptre .
and Esther answered , If it seem good unto the king , let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him .
then the king said , Cause Haman to make haste , that he may do as Esther hath said . so the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
and the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is THY petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is THY request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
nevertheless Haman refrained himself : and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends , and Zeresh his wife .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Haman said moreover , Yea , Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
and the king said , Who is in the court ? now Haman was come into the outward court of the king 's house , to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
and Mordecai came again to the king 's gate . but Haman hasted to his house mourning , and having his head covered .
and while they were yet talking with him , came the king 's chamberlains , and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared .
and the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is THY petition , queen Esther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is THY request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
then Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in THY sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen , Who is he , and where is he , that durst presume in his heart to do so ?
so they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . then was the king 's wrath pacified .
on that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews ' enemy unto Esther the queen . and Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was unto her .
and the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it unto Mordecai . and Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
and Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther . so Esther arose , and stood before the king ,
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , behold , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries :
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out , being hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . and the decree was given at Shushan the palace .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
and all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them .
for Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater .
thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
and Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha ,
on that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king .
then said Esther , If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows .
and the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons .
for the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
but the other Jews that were in the king 's provinces gathered themselves together , and stood for their lives , and had rest from their enemies , and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand , but they laid not their hands on the prey ,
on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
but the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof ; and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , that dwelt in the unwalled towns , made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
and Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , both nigh and far ,
to stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
and the Jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as Mordecai had written unto them ;
because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had devised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast PUR , that is , the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ;
but when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority , to confirm this second letter of Purim .
and he sent the letters unto all the Jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
and the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land , and upon the isles of the sea .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , whereunto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God , and eschewed evil .
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
and his sons went and feasted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them .
and the Lord said unto Satan , Whence comest thou ? then Satan answered the Lord , and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
and the Lord said unto Satan , behold , all that he hath is in THY power ; only upon himself put not forth thine hand . so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord .
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
and the Sabeans fell upon them , and took them away ; yea , they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Thy sons and THY daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
then Job arose , and rent his mantle , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ,
and said , naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thither : the Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord .
again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord .
and the Lord said unto Satan , From whence comest thou ? and Satan answered the Lord , and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
and Satan answered the Lord , and said , Skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life .
so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sat down among the ashes .
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and wept ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven .
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spake a word unto him : for they saw that his grief was very great .
let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived .
let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to raise up their mourning .
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day :
because it shut not up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
why died I not from the womb ? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly ?
why did the knees prevent me ? or why the breasts that I should suck ?
for now should I have lain still and been quiet , I should have slept : then had I been at rest ,
or with princes that had gold , who filled their houses with silver :
there the wicked cease from troubling ; and there the weary be at rest .
there the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
the small and great are there ; and the servant is free from his master .
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ;
which long for death , but it cometh not ; and dig for it more than for hid treasures ;
which rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
for my sighing cometh before I eat , and my roarings are poured out like the waters .
for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me , and that which I was afraid of is come unto me .
if we assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
THY words have upholden him that was falling , and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees .
but now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
is not this THY fear , THY confidence , THY hope , and the uprightness of THY ways ?
remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ?
even as I have seen , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickedness , reap the same .
by the blast of God they perish , and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion 's whelps are scattered abroad .
fear came upon me , and trembling , which made all my bones to shake .
then a spirit passed before my face ; the hair of my flesh stood up :
it stood still , but I could not discern the form thereof : an image was before mine eyes , there was silence , and I heard a voice , saying ,
behold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his angels he charged with Folly :
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
Doth not their excellency which is in them go away ? they die , even without wisdom .
call now , if there be any that will answer thee ; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn ?
for wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one .
his children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ;
who giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth waters upon the fields :
to set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety .
he disappointeth the devices of the crafty , so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise .
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness : and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong .
they meet with darkness in the daytime , and grope in the noonday as in the night .
but he saveth the poor from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
in famine he shall redeem thee from death : and in war from the power of the sword .
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth .
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
and thou shalt know that THY tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit THY habitation , and shalt not sin .
Thou shalt know also that THY seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
Thou shalt come to THY grave in a full age , like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season .
Lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for THY good .
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed , and my calamity laid in the balances together !
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea : therefore my words are swallowed up .
for the arrows of the Almighty are within me , the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit : the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me .
can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
Oh that I might have my request ; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for !
even that it would please God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
then should I yet have comfort ; yea , I would harden myself in sorrow : let him not spare ; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
what is my strength , that I should hope ? and what is mine end , that I should prolong my life ?
is my strength the strength of stones ? or is my flesh of brass ?
is not my help in me ? and is wisdom driven quite from me ?
which are blackish by reason of the ice , and wherein the snow is hid :
what time they wax warm , they vanish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
the paths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing , and perish .
did I say , Bring unto me ? or , Give a reward for me of your substance ?
teach me , and I will hold my tongue : and cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
do ye imagine to reprove words , and the speeches of one that is desperate , which are as wind ?
Yea , ye overwhelm the fatherless , and ye dig a pit for your friend .
return , I pray you , let it not be iniquity ; yea , return again , my righteousness is in it .
is there not an appointed time to man upon earth ? are not his days also like the days of an hireling ?
as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work :
so am I made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and become loathsome .
my days are swifter than a weaver 's shuttle , and are spent without hope .
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away : so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more .
he shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
when I say , My bed shall comfort me , my couch shall ease my complaint ;
then thou scarest me with dreams , and terrifiest me through visions :
what is man , that thou shouldest magnify him ? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him ?
I have sinned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserver of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
how long wilt thou speak these things ? and how long shall the words of THY mouth be like a strong wind ?
if THY children have sinned against him , and he have cast them away for their transgression ;
if thou wert pure and upright ; surely now he would awake for thee , and make the habitation of THY righteousness prosperous .
for inquire , I pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers :
( for we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days upon earth are a shadow : )
shall not they teach thee , and tell thee , and utter words out of their heart ?
whilst it is yet in his greenness , and not cut down , it withereth before any other herb .
whose hope shall be cut off , and whose trust shall be a spider 's web .
he shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand : he shall hold it fast , but it shall not endure .
if he destroy him from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , I have not seen thee .
behold , this is the joy of his way , and out of the earth shall others grow .
behold , God will not cast away a perfect man , neither will he help the evil doers :
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought .
he is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against him , and hath prospered ?
which shaketh the earth out of her place , and the pillars thereof tremble .
which commandeth the sun , and it riseth not ; and sealeth up the stars .
Lo , he goeth by me , and I see him not : he passeth on also , but I perceive him not .
whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not answer , but I would make supplication to my judge .
if I had called , and he had answered me ; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice .
for he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
he will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with bitterness .
if I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ?
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soul : I would despise my life .
if the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
now my days are swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
they are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey .
if I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself :
I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent .
if I wash myself with snow water , and make my hands never so clean ;
yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine own clothes shall abhor me .
for he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , and we should come together in judgment .
let him take his rod away from me , and let not his fear terrify me :
my soul is weary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon myself ; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul .
I will say unto God , Do not condemn me ; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me .
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
that thou inquirest after mine iniquity , and searchest after my sin ?
Thou knowest that I am not wicked ; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand .
remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and wilt thou bring me into dust again ?
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh , and hast fenced me with bones and sinews .
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart : I know that this is with thee .
if I sin , then thou markest me , and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity .
if I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
for it increaseth . Thou huntest me as a fierce lion : and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me .
Thou renewest THY witnesses against me , and increasest thine indignation upon me ; changes and war are against me .
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
I should have been as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
are not my days few ? cease then , and let me alone , that I may take comfort a little ,
before I go whence I shall not return , even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ;
a land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
should THY lies make men hold their peace ? and when thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ?
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom , that they are double to that which is ! know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth .
it is as high as heaven ; what canst thou do ? deeper than hell ; what canst thou know ?
the measure thereof is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
for he knoweth vain men : he seeth wickedness also ; will he not then consider it ?
if iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not wickedness dwell in THY tabernacles .
for then shalt thou lift up THY face without spot ; yea , thou shalt be stedfast , and shalt not fear :
because thou shalt forget THY misery , and remember it as waters that pass away :
and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday ; thou shalt shine forth , thou shalt be as the morning .
and thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ; yea , thou shalt dig about thee , and thou shalt take THY rest in safety .
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail , and they shall not escape , and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost .
but I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you : yea , who knoweth not such things as these ?
I am as one mocked of his neighbour , who calleth upon God , and he answereth him : the just upright man is laughed to scorn .
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee :
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee : and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this ?
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind .
with the ancient is wisdom ; and in length of days understanding .
behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up : also he sendeth them out , and they overturn the earth .
he looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loins with a girdle .
he removeth away the speech of the trusty , and taketh away the understanding of the aged .
he discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
what ye know , the same do I know also : I am not inferior unto you .
but ye are forgers of lies , ye are all physicians of no value .
O that ye would altogether hold your peace ! and it should be your wisdom .
hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips .
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another , do ye so mock him ?
hold your peace , let me alone , that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in mine hand ?
behold now , I have ordered my cause ; I know that I shall be justified .
who is he that will plead with me ? for now , if I hold my tongue , I shall give up the ghost .
withdraw thine hand far from me : and let not THY dread make me afraid .
how many are mine iniquities and sins ? make me to know my transgression and my sin .
for thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
he cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
and dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one , and bringest me into judgment with thee ?
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass ;
turn from him , that he may rest , till he shall accomplish , as an hireling , his day .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock thereof die in the ground ;
but man dieth , and wasteth away : yea , man giveth up the ghost , and where is he ?
so man lieth down , and riseth not : till the heavens be no more , they shall not awake , nor be raised out of their sleep .
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until THY wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
if a man die , shall he live again ? all the days of my appointed time will I wait , till my change come .
Thou shalt call , and I will answer thee : thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands .
for now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
my transgression is sealed up in a bag , and thou sewest up mine iniquity .
and surely the mountain falling cometh to nought , and the rock is removed out of his place .
the waters wear the stones : thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of man .
Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth : thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away .
his sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them .
should he reason with unprofitable talk ? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ?
for THY mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty .
are the consolations of God small with thee ? is there any secret thing with thee ?
why doth thine heart carry thee away ? and what do THY eyes wink at ,
that thou turnest THY spirit against God , and lettest such words go out of THY mouth ?
what is man , that he should be clean ? and he which is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his saints ; yea , the heavens are not clean in his sight .
I will shew thee , hear me ; and that which I have seen I will declare ;
which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hid it :
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
a dreadful sound is in his ears : in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him .
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is waited for of the sword .
he wandereth abroad for bread , saying , Where is it ? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
he runneth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of his bucklers :
because he covereth his face with his fatness , and maketh collops of fat on his flanks .
and he dwelleth in desolate cities , and in houses which no man inhabiteth , which are ready to become heaps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth .
he shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away .
let not him that is deceived trust in vanity : for vanity shall be his recompence .
it shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not be green .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul 's stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
but I would strengthen you with my mouth , and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief .
though I speak , my grief is not asswaged : and though I forbear , what am I eased ?
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
he teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me .
they have gaped upon me with their mouth ; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
God hath delivered me to the ungodly , and turned me over into the hands of the wicked .
I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
his archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
my face is foul with weeping , and my eyelids is the shadow of death ;
also now , behold , my witness is in heaven , and my record is on high .
O that one might plead for a man with God , as a man pleadeth for his neighbour !
when a few years are come , then I shall go the way whence I shall not return .
are there not mockers with me ? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation ?
he that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
he hath made me also a byword of the people ; and aforetime I was as a tabret .
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
upright men shall be astonied at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite .
the righteous also shall hold on his way , and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger .
but as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for I cannot find one wise man among you .
my days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the thoughts of my heart .
if I wait , the grave is mine house : I have made my bed in the darkness .
I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou are my mother , and my sister .
and where is now my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
how long will it be ERE ye make an end of words ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
he teareth himself in his anger : shall the earth be forsaken for thee ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
Yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the spark of his fire shall not shine .
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle , and his candle shall be put out with him .
the steps of his strength shall be straitened , and his own counsel shall cast him down .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
the gin shall take him by the heel , and the robber shall prevail against him .
the snare is laid for him in the ground , and a trap for him in the way .
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall drive him to his feet .
it shall devour the strength of his skin : even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength .
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle , and it shall bring him to the king of terrors .
it shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his : brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation .
his roots shall be dried up beneath , and above shall his branch be cut off .
his remembrance shall perish from the earth , and he shall have no name in the street .
he shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world .
they that come after him shall be astonied at his day , as they that went before were affrighted .
these ten times have ye reproached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
and be it indeed that I have erred , mine error remaineth with myself .
he hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass , and he hath set darkness in my paths .
he hath stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
he hath destroyed me on every side , and I am gone : and mine hope hath he removed like a tree .
he hath also kindled his wrath against me , and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies .
he hath put my brethren far from me , and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me .
they that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight .
I called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; I intreated him with my mouth .
my breath is strange to my wife , though I intreated for the children 's sake of mine own body .
Yea , young children despised me ; I arose , and they spake against me .
all my inward friends abhorred me : and they whom I loved are turned against me .
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth .
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
Oh that my words were now written ! Oh that they were printed in a book !
for I know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth :
and though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God :
whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another ; though my reins be consumed within me .
but ye should say , Why persecute we him , seeing the root of the matter is found in me ?
be ye afraid of the sword : for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword , that ye may know there is a judgment .
I have heard the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer .
that the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment ?
though his excellency mount up to the heavens , and his head reach unto the clouds ;
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night .
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more ; neither shall his place any more behold him .
his children shall seek to please the poor , and his hands shall restore their goods .
his bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
though he spare it , and forsake it not ; but keep it still within his mouth :
yet his meat in his bowels is turned , it is the gall of asps within him .
he hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again : God shall cast them out of his belly .
he shall suck the poison of asps : the viper 's tongue shall slay him .
he shall not see the rivers , the floods , the brooks of honey and butter .
that which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor ; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not ;
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
there shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits : every hand of the wicked shall come upon him .
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
he shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steel shall strike him through .
it is drawn , and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glittering sword cometh out of his gall : terrors are upon him .
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
the heaven shall reveal his iniquity ; and the earth shall rise up against him .
the increase of his house shall depart , and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath .
suffer me that I may speak ; and after that I have spoken , mock on .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
mark me , and be astonished , and lay your hand upon your mouth .
even when I remember I am afraid , and trembling taketh hold on my flesh .
Wherefore do the wicked live , become old , yea , are mighty in power ?
their seed is established in their sight with them , and their offspring before their eyes .
they send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance .
they spend their days in wealth , and in a moment go down to the grave .
Lo , their good is not in their hand : the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
how oft is the candle of the wicked put out ! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them ! God distributeth sorrows in his anger .
his eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty .
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
his breasts are full of milk , and his bones are moistened with marrow .
and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul , and never eateth with pleasure .
they shall lie down alike in the dust , and the worms shall cover them .
for ye say , Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked ?
have ye not asked them that go by the way ? and do ye not know their tokens ,
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath .
who shall declare his way to his face ? and who shall repay him what he hath done ?
yet shall he be brought to the grave , and shall remain in the tomb .
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that thou art righteous ? or is it gain to him that thou makest THY ways perfect ?
will he reprove thee for fear of thee ? will he enter with thee into judgment ?
for thou hast taken a pledge from THY brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
but as for the mighty man , he had the earth ; and the honourable man dwelt in it .
Thou has sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
is not God in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
thick clouds are a covering to him , that he seeth not ; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven .
whereas our substance is not cut down , but the remnant of them the fire consumeth .
acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
receive , I pray thee , the law from his mouth , and lay up his words in thine heart .
if thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from THY tabernacles .
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks .
Yea , the Almighty shall be THY defence , and thou shalt have plenty of silver .
for then shalt thou have THY delight in the Almighty , and shalt lift up THY face unto God .
Thou shalt make THY prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay THY vows .
Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon THY ways .
when men are cast down , then thou shalt say , There is lifting up ; and he shall save the humble person .
Oh that I knew where I might find him ! that I might come even to his seat !
I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would say unto me .
will he plead against me with his great power ? no ; but he would put strength in me .
behold , I go forward , but he is not there ; and backward , but I cannot perceive him :
on the left hand , where he doth work , but I cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot see him :
but he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
my foot hath held his steps , his way have I kept , and not declined .
neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips ; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
but he is in one mind , and who can turn him ? and what his soul desireth , even that he doeth .
for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me : and many such things are with him .
therefore am I troubled at his presence : when I consider , I am afraid of him .
because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he covered the darkness from my face .
some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
they drive away the ass of the fatherless , they take the widow 's ox for a pledge .
they turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
behold , as wild asses in the desert , go they forth to their work ; rising betimes for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children .
they reap every one his corn in the field : and they gather the vintage of the wicked .
they cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no covering in the cold .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
they pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor .
they cause him to go naked without clothing , and they take away the sheaf from the hungry ;
men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out : yet God layeth not Folly to them .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , saying , No eye shall see me : and disguiseth his face .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
the womb shall forget him ; the worm shall feed sweetly on him ; he shall be no more remembered ; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree .
he draweth also the mighty with his power : he riseth up , and no man is sure of life .
though it be given him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet his eyes are upon their ways .
they are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
is there any number of his armies ? and upon whom doth not his light arise ?
how then can man be justified with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
behold even to the moon , and it shineth not ; yea , the stars are not pure in his sight .
how much less man , that is a worm ? and the son of man , which is a worm ?
how hast thou helped him that is without power ? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength ?
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom ? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is ?
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds ; and the cloud is not rent under them .
he holdeth back the face of his throne , and spreadeth his cloud upon it .
he hath compassed the waters with bounds , until the day and night come to an end .
by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens ; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent .
Lo , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is heard of him ? but the Thunder of his power who can understand ?
all the while my breath is in me , and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ;
God forbid that I should justify you : till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me .
my righteousness I hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live .
let mine enemy be as the wicked , and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous .
for what is the hope of the hypocrite , though he hath gained , when God taketh away his soul ?
I will teach you by the hand of God : that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
this is the portion of a wicked man with God , and the heritage of oppressors , which they shall receive of the Almighty .
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
those that remain of him shall be buried in death : and his widows shall not weep .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
Terrors take hold on him as waters , a tempest stealeth him away in the night .
the east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth : and as a storm hurleth him out of his place .
for God shall cast upon him , and not spare : he would fain flee out of his hand .
iron is taken out of the earth , and brass is molten out of the stone .
he setteth an end to darkness , and searcheth out all perfection : the stones of darkness , and the shadow of death .
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
as for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire .
the stones of it are the place of sapphires : and it hath dust of gold .
there is a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture 's eye hath not seen :
the lion 's whelps have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it .
he putteth forth his hand upon the rock ; he overturneth the mountains by the roots .
he bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light .
but where shall wisdom be found ? and where is the place of understanding ?
man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
it cannot be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof .
it cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold .
no mention shall be made of coral , or of pearls : for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
the topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it , neither shall it be valued with pure gold .
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the fowls of the air .
to make the weight for the winds ; and he weigheth the waters by measure .
when he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the Thunder :
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , yea , and searched it out .
Oh that I were as in months past , as in the days when God preserved me ;
when his candle shined upon my head , and when by his light I walked through darkness ;
as I was in the days of my youth , when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle ;
when I washed my steps with butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ;
when I went out to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street !
the young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and stood up .
the nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth .
when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me :
because I delivered the poor that cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him .
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me : and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
I put on righteousness , and it clothed me : my judgment was as a robe and a diadem .
I was eyes to the blind , and feet was I to the lame .
I was a father to the poor : and the cause which I knew not I searched out .
and I brake the jaws of the wicked , and plucked the spoil out of his teeth .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
my glory was fresh in me , and my bow was renewed in my hand .
and they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
if I laughed on them , they believed it not ; and the light of my countenance they cast not down .
I chose out their way , and sat chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourners .
but now they that are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock .
Yea , whereto might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom old age was perished ?
who cut up mallows by the bushes , and juniper roots for their meat .
they were driven forth from among men , ( they cried after them as after a thief ; )
to dwell in the clifts of the valleys , in caves of the earth , and in the rocks .
they were children of fools , yea , children of base men : they were viler than the earth .
they abhor me , they flee far from me , and spare not to spit in my face .
because he hath loosed my cord , and afflicted me , they have also let loose the bridle before me .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me .
Terrors are turned upon me : they pursue my soul as the wind : and my welfare passeth away as a cloud .
and now my soul is poured out upon me ; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me .
my bones are pierced in me in the night season : and my sinews take no rest .
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed : it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat .
he hath cast me into the mire , and I am become like dust and ashes .
I cry unto thee , and thou dost not hear me : I stand up , and thou regardest me not .
Thou art become cruel to me : with THY strong hand thou opposest thyself against me .
Thou liftest me up to the wind ; thou causest me to ride upon it , and dissolvest my substance .
for I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living .
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though they cry in his destruction .
did not I weep for him that was in trouble ? was not my soul grieved for the poor ?
when I looked for good , then evil came unto me : and when I waited for light , there came darkness .
I am a brother to dragons , and a companion to owls .
my skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat .
my harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that weep .
I made a Covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I think upon a maid ?
is not destruction to the wicked ? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity ?
let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know mine integrity .
if my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ;
then let me sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out .
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour 's door ;
then let my wife grind unto another , and let others bow down upon her .
for this is an heinous crime ; yea , it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges .
if I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant , when they contended with me ;
what then shall I do when God riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ?
if I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ;
or have eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof ;
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother 's womb ; )
if his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the Fleece of my sheep ;
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , when I saw my help in the gate :
then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
for destruction from God was a terror to me , and by reason of his highness I could not endure .
if I rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much ;
if I beheld the sun when it shined , or the moon walking in brightness ;
this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge : for I should have denied the God that is above .
if I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him :
neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul .
if the men of my tabernacle said not , Oh that we had of his flesh ! we cannot be satisfied .
the stranger did not lodge in the street : but I opened my doors to the traveller .
surely I would take it upon my shoulder , and bind it as a crown to me .
I would declare unto him the number of my steps ; as a prince would I go near unto him .
if I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life :
then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than God .
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job .
and Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am young , and ye are very old ; wherefore I was afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
but there is a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding .
behold , I waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasons , whilst ye searched out what to say .
Yea , I attended unto you , and , behold , there was none of you that convinced Job , or that answered his words :
when I had waited , ( for they spake not , but stood still , and answered no more ; )
I said , I will answer also my part , I also will shew mine opinion .
behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; it is ready to burst like new bottles .
I will speak , that I may be refreshed : I will open my lips and answer .
let me not , I pray you , accept any man 's person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
for I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
behold , now I have opened my mouth , my tongue hath spoken in my mouth .
my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly .
if thou canst answer me , set THY words in order before me , stand up .
behold , I am according to THY wish in God 's stead : I also am formed out of the clay .
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of THY words , saying ,
I am clean without transgression , I am innocent ; neither is there iniquity in me .
he putteth my feet in the stocks , he marketh all my paths .
why dost thou strive against him ? for he giveth not account of any of his matters .
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ;
then he openeth the ears of men , and sealeth their instruction ,
that he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
he keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong pain :
his flesh is consumed away , that it cannot be seen ; and his bones that were not seen stick out .
Yea , his soul draweth near unto the grave , and his life to the destroyers .
then he is gracious unto him , and saith , Deliver him from going down to the pit : I have found a ransom .
his flesh shall be fresher than a child 's : he shall return to the days of his youth :
he shall pray unto God , and he will be favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will render unto man his righteousness .
he looketh upon men , and if any say , I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ;
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
Lo , all these things worketh God oftentimes with man ,
if thou hast any thing to say , answer me : speak , for I desire to justify thee .
let us choose to us judgment : let us know among ourselves what is good .
therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness ; and from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
for the work of a man shall he render unto him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
if he set his heart upon man , if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath ;
if now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice of my words .
how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor ? for they all are the work of his hands .
in a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be taken away without hand .
for he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with God .
he shall break in pieces mighty men without number , and set others in their stead .
therefore he knoweth their works , and he overturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
when he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
surely it is meet to be said unto God , I have borne chastisement , I will not offend any more :
that which I see not teach thou me : if I have done iniquity , I will do no more .
should it be according to THY mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest .
my desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men .
for thou saidst , What advantage will it be unto thee ? and , What profit shall I have , if I be cleansed from my sin ?
look unto the heavens , and see ; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou .
if thou sinnest , what doest thou against him ? or if THY transgressions be multiplied , what doest thou unto him ?
THY wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ; and THY righteousness may profit the son of man .
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty .
who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth , and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven ?
although thou sayest thou shalt not see him , yet judgment is before him ; therefore trust thou in him .
but now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity :
I will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker .
for truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee .
he preserveth not the life of the wicked : but giveth right to the poor .
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
and if they be bound in fetters , and be holden in cords of affliction ;
then he sheweth them their work , and their transgressions that they have exceeded .
he openeth also their ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on THY table should be full of fatness .
because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee .
will he esteem THY riches ? no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place .
behold , God is great , and we know him not , neither can the number of his years be searched out .
for he maketh small the drops of water : they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof :
also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of his tabernacle ?
with clouds he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt .
at this also my heart trembleth , and is moved out of his place .
hear attentively the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth out of his mouth .
he directeth it under the whole heaven , and his lightning unto the ends of the earth .
after it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of his excellency ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard .
for he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
then the beasts go into dens , and remain in their places .
out of the south cometh the whirlwind : and cold out of the north .
by the breath of God Frost is given : and the breadth of the waters is straitened .
also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud : he scattereth his bright cloud :
and it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
Dost thou know when God disposed them , and caused the light of his cloud to shine ?
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge ?
Hast thou with him spread out the sky , which is strong , and as a molten looking glass ?
shall it be told him that I speak ? if a man speak , surely he shall be swallowed up .
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but the wind passeth , and cleanseth them .
touching the Almighty , we cannot find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
Gird up now THY loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and answer thou me .
where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ? declare , if thou hast understanding .
who hath laid the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? or who hath stretched the line upon it ?
when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
or who shut up the sea with doors , when it brake forth , as if it had issued out of the womb ?
when I made the cloud the garment thereof , and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it ,
and brake up for it my decreed place , and set bars and doors ,
and said , hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall THY proud waves be stayed ?
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
and from the wicked their light is withholden , and the high arm shall be broken .
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea ? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth ?
have the gates of death been opened unto thee ? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof ?
who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters , or a way for the lightning of Thunder ;
to cause it to rain on the earth , where no man is ; on the wilderness , wherein there is no man ;
to satisfy the desolate and waste ground ; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? and the hoary Frost of heaven , who hath gendered it ?
the waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven ? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth ?
Canst thou lift up THY voice to the clouds , that abundance of waters may cover thee ?
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the heart ?
who can number the clouds in wisdom ? or who can stay the bottles of heaven ,
when the dust groweth into hardness , and the clods cleave fast together ?
when they couch in their dens , and abide in the covert to lie in wait ?
who provideth for the raven his food ? when his young ones cry unto God , they wander for lack of meat .
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve ?
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil ? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
they bow themselves , they bring forth their young ones , they cast out their sorrows .
their young ones are in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto them .
who hath sent out the wild ass free ? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass ?
he scorneth the multitude of the city , neither regardeth he the crying of the driver .
the range of the mountains is his pasture , and he searcheth after every green thing .
Wilt thou trust him , because his strength is great ? or wilt thou leave THY labour to him ?
Wilt thou believe him , that he will bring home THY seed , and gather it into THY barn ?
and forgetteth that the foot may crush them , or that the wild beast may break them .
she is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in vain without fear ;
because God hath deprived her of wisdom , neither hath he imparted to her understanding .
what time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his Rider .
he paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength : he goeth on to meet the armed men .
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
he saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the Thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
Doth the eagle mount up at THY command , and make her nest on high ?
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
once have I spoken ; but I will not answer : yea , twice ; but I will proceed no further .
then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
cast abroad the rage of THY wrath : and behold every one that is proud , and abase him .
look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tread down the wicked in their place .
behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
Lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the navel of his belly .
he moveth his tail like a cedar : the sinews of his stones are wrapped together .
his bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron .
he is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
he lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the Reed , and fens .
the shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the Brook compass him about .
behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth .
Canst thou put an hook into his nose ? or bore his jaw through with a Thorn ?
will he make many supplications unto thee ? will he speak soft words unto thee ?
will he make a Covenant with thee ? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever ?
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron ? or his head with fish spears ?
behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
none is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
who hath prevented me , that I should repay him ? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine .
one is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
they are joined one to another , they stick together , that they cannot be sundered .
by his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out .
his breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
in his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy before him .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they cannot be moved .
his heart is as firm as a stone ; yea , as hard as a piece of the nether millstone .
when he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of breakings they purify themselves .
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment .
he maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
I know that thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee .
hear , I beseech thee , and I will speak : I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee .
and it was so , that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job , the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled against thee , and against THY two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job hath .
so Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went , and did according as the Lord commanded them : the Lord also accepted Job .
and the Lord turned the captivity of Job , when he prayed for his friends : also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before .
so the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
after this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
so Job died , being old and full of days .
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
but his delight is in the law of the Lord ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
the ungodly are not so : but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away .
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous .
for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish .
the kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the Lord , and against his anointed , saying ,
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh : the Lord shall have them in derision .
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath , and vex them in his sore displeasure .
ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for THY possession .
Kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
Lord , how are they increased that trouble me ! many are they that rise up against me .
but thou , O Lord , art a shield for me ; my glory , and the lifter up of mine head .
I cried unto the Lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his holy hill . Selah .
I laid me down and slept ; I awaked ; for the Lord sustained me .
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
arise , O Lord ; save me , O my God : for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
hear me when I call , O God of my righteousness : thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress ; have mercy upon me , and hear my prayer .
O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after leasing ? Selah .
but know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself : the Lord will hear when I call unto him .
stand in awe , and sin not : commune with your own heart upon your bed , and be still . Selah .
offer the sacrifices of righteousness , and put your trust in the Lord .
I will both lay me down in peace , and sleep : for thou , Lord , only makest me dwell in safety .
Hearken unto the voice of my cry , my King , and my God : for unto thee will I pray .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
for thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
the foolish shall not stand in THY sight : thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
but as for me , I will come into THY house in the multitude of THY mercy : and in THY fear will I worship toward THY holy temple .
lead me , O Lord , in THY righteousness because of mine enemies ; make THY way straight before my face .
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth ; their inward part is very wickedness ; their throat is an open sepulchre ; they flatter with their tongue .
destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own counsels ; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions ; for they have rebelled against thee .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love THY name be joyful in thee .
for thou , Lord , wilt bless the righteous ; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield .
have mercy upon me , O Lord ; for I am weak : O Lord , heal me ; for my bones are vexed .
I am weary with my groaning ; all the night make I my bed to swim ; I water my couch with my tears .
mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies .
depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity ; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping .
the Lord hath heard my supplication ; the Lord will receive my prayer .
O Lord my God , in thee do I put my trust : save me from all them that persecute me , and deliver me :
O Lord my God , if I have done this ; if there be iniquity in my hands ;
if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let him tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust . Selah .
arise , O Lord , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
so shall the Congregation of the people compass thee about : for their sakes therefore return thou on high .
the Lord shall judge the people : judge me , O Lord , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end ; but establish the just : for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins .
if he turn not , he will whet his sword ; he hath bent his bow , and made it ready .
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors .
he made a pit , and digged it , and is fallen into the ditch which he made .
his mischief shall return upon his own head , and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate .
out of the mouth of Babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies , that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger .
when I consider THY heavens , the work of THY fingers , the moon and the stars , which thou hast ordained ;
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of THY hands ; thou hast put all things under his feet :
all sheep and oxen , yea , and the beasts of the field ;
the fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas .
I will praise thee , O Lord , with my whole heart ; I will shew forth all THY marvellous works .
I will be glad and rejoice in thee : I will sing praise to THY name , O thou most High .
when mine enemies are turned back , they shall fall and perish at THY presence .
Thou hast rebuked the heathen , thou hast destroyed the wicked , thou hast put out their name for ever and ever .
O thou enemy , destructions are come to a perpetual end : and thou hast destroyed cities ; their memorial is perished with them .
and he shall judge the world in righteousness , he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness .
the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed , a refuge in times of trouble .
and they that know THY name will put their trust in thee : for thou , Lord , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
sing praises to the Lord , which dwelleth in Zion : declare among the people his doings .
when he maketh Inquisition for blood , he remembereth them : he forgetteth not the cry of the humble .
have mercy upon me , O Lord ; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me , thou that liftest me up from the gates of death :
that I may shew forth all THY praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion : I will rejoice in THY salvation .
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken .
the Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . Higgaion . Selah .
the wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God .
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten : the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever .
arise , O Lord ; let not man prevail : let the heathen be judged in THY sight .
put them in fear , O Lord : that the nations may know themselves to be but men . Selah .
why standest thou afar off , O Lord ? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble ?
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined .
his ways are always grievous ; THY judgments are far above out of his sight : as for all his enemies , he puffeth at them .
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doth he murder the innocent : his eyes are privily set against the poor .
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
he croucheth , and humbleth himself , that the poor may fall by his strong ones .
Thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with THY hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man : seek out his wickedness till thou find none .
the Lord is King for ever and ever : the heathen are perished out of his land .
Lord , thou hast heard the desire of the humble : thou wilt prepare their heart , thou wilt cause thine ear to hear :
in the Lord put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , flee as a bird to your mountain ?
for , lo , the wicked bend their bow , they make ready their arrow upon the string , that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart .
the Lord is in his holy temple , the Lord 's throne is in heaven : his eyes behold , his eyelids try , the children of men .
the Lord trieth the righteous : but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth .
upon the wicked he shall rain snares , fire and brimstone , and an horrible tempest : this shall be the portion of their cup .
help , Lord ; for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithful fail from among the children of men .
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak .
the Lord shall cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that speaketh proud things :
for the oppression of the poor , for the sighing of the needy , now will I arise , saith the Lord ; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him .
the words of the Lord are pure words : as silver tried in a furnace of earth , purified seven times .
how long shall I take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart daily ? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me ?
consider and hear me , O Lord my God : lighten mine eyes , lest I sleep the sleep of death ;
but I have trusted in THY mercy ; my heart shall rejoice in THY salvation .
the fool hath said in his heart , There is no God . they are corrupt , they have done abominable works , there is none that doeth good .
the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , and seek God .
they are all gone aside , they are all together become filthy : there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread , and call not upon the Lord .
there were they in great fear : for God is in the generation of the righteous .
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion ! when the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people , Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
he that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in his heart .
he that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned ; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord . he that sweareth to his own hurt , and changeth not .
he that putteth not out his money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent . he that doeth these things shall never be moved .
but to the saints that are in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom is all my delight .
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god : their drink offerings of blood will I not offer , nor take up their names into my lips .
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea , I have a goodly heritage .
I will bless the Lord , who hath given me counsel : my reins also instruct me in the night seasons .
I have set the Lord always before me : because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved .
therefore my heart is glad , and my glory rejoiceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
Thou wilt shew me the path of life : in THY presence is fulness of joy ; at THY right hand there are pleasures for evermore .
hear the right , O Lord , attend unto my cry , give ear unto my prayer , that goeth not out of feigned lips .
let my sentence come forth from THY presence ; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal .
Thou has proved mine heart ; thou hast visited me in the night ; thou has tried me , and shalt find nothing ; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress .
concerning the works of men , by the word of THY lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer .
I have called upon thee , for thou wilt hear me , O God : incline thine ear unto me , and hear my speech .
Shew THY marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by THY right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
keep me as the apple of the eye , hide me under the shadow of THY wings ,
from the wicked that oppress me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about .
they are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
they have now compassed us in our steps : they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth ;
like as a lion that is greedy of his prey , and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places .
arise , O Lord , disappoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is THY sword :
as for me , I will behold THY face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with THY likeness .
the Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the Horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
I will call upon the Lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
the sorrows of death compassed me , and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid .
in my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken , because he was wroth .
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down : and darkness was under his feet .
and he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : yea , he did fly upon the wings of the wind .
he made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed , hail stones and coals of fire .
the Lord also thundered in the heavens , and the Highest gave his voice ; hail stones and coals of fire .
Yea , he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; and he shot out lightnings , and discomfited them .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at THY rebuke , O Lord , at the blast of the breath of THY nostrils .
he sent from above , he took me , he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them which hated me : for they were too strong for me .
they prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the Lord was my stay .
he brought me forth also into a large place ; he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
for all his judgments were before me , and I did not put away his statutes from me .
I was also upright before him , and I kept myself from mine iniquity .
therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful ; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright ;
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward .
for thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down high looks .
for by thee I have run through a troop ; and by my God have I leaped over a wall .
as for God , his way is perfect : the word of the Lord is tried : he is a buckler to all those that trust in him .
it is God that girdeth me with strength , and maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my feet like hinds ' feet , and setteth me upon my high places .
he teacheth my hands to war , so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
Thou hast also given me the shield of THY salvation : and THY right hand hath holden me up , and THY gentleness hath made me great .
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me , that my feet did not slip .
I have pursued mine enemies , and overtaken them : neither did I turn again till they were consumed .
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are fallen under my feet .
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle : thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me .
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies ; that I might destroy them that hate me .
they cried , but there was none to save them : even unto the Lord , but he answered them not .
then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind : I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets .
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
as soon as they hear of me , they shall obey me : the strangers shall submit themselves unto me .
the strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
the Lord liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and let the God of my salvation be exalted .
he delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
therefore will I give thanks unto thee , O Lord , among the heathen , and sing praises unto THY name .
great deliverance giveth he to his king ; and sheweth mercy to his anointed , to David , and to his seed for evermore .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
his going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
the law of the Lord is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple .
the statutes of the Lord are right , rejoicing the heart : the commandment of the Lord is pure , enlightening the eyes .
the fear of the Lord is clean , enduring for ever : the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether .
moreover by them is THY servant warned : and in keeping of them there is great reward .
keep back THY servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great transgression .
the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee ;
grant thee according to thine own heart , and fulfil all THY counsel .
we will rejoice in THY salvation , and in the name of our God we will set up our banners : the Lord fulfil all THY petitions .
now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed ; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand .
some trust in chariots , and some in horses : but we will remember the name of the Lord our God .
the king shall joy in THY strength , O Lord ; and in THY salvation how greatly shall he rejoice !
Thou hast given him his heart 's desire , and hast not withholden the request of his lips . Selah .
for thou preventest him with the blessings of Goodness : thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head .
he asked life of thee , and thou gavest it him , even length of days for ever and ever .
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever : thou hast made him exceeding glad with THY countenance .
for the king trusteth in the Lord , and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved .
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies : THY right hand shall find out those that hate thee .
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger : the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall devour them .
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth , and their seed from among the children of men .
for they intended evil against thee : they imagined a mischievous device , which they are not able to perform .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon THY strings against the face of them .
be thou exalted , Lord , in thine own strength : so will we sing and praise THY power .
my God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? why art thou so far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ?
O my God , I cry in the daytime , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
they cried unto thee , and were delivered : they trusted in thee , and were not confounded .
all they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the head saying ,
but thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother 's breasts .
I was cast upon thee from the womb : thou art my God from my mother 's belly .
they gaped upon me with their mouths , as a ravening and a roaring lion .
I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death .
for dogs have compassed me : the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feet .
deliver my soul from the sword ; my darling from the power of the dog .
save me from the lion 's mouth : for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns .
I will declare THY name unto my brethren : in the midst of the Congregation will I praise thee .
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him ; but when he cried unto him , he heard .
my praise shall be of thee in the great Congregation : I will pay my vows before them that fear him .
the meek shall eat and be satisfied : they shall praise the Lord that seek him : your heart shall live for ever .
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord : and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee .
for the kingdom is the Lord 's : and he is the governor among the nations .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
a seed shall serve him ; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation .
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters .
he restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; THY rod and THY staff they comfort me .
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
surely Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever .
the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord ? or who shall stand in his holy place ?
he that hath clean hands , and a pure heart ; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity , nor sworn deceitfully .
he shall receive the blessing from the Lord , and righteousness from the God of his salvation .
this is the generation of them that seek him , that seek THY face , O Jacob . Selah .
lift up your head , O ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in .
lift up your heads , O ye gates ; even lift them up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in .
O my God , I trust in thee : let me not be ashamed , let not mine enemies triumph over me .
Yea , let none that wait on thee be ashamed : let them be ashamed which transgress without cause .
lead me in THY truth , and teach me : for thou art the God of my salvation ; on thee do I wait all the day .
remember not the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions : according to THY mercy remember thou me for THY Goodness ' sake , O Lord .
the meek will he guide in judgment : and the meek will he teach his way .
all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his Covenant and his testimonies .
for THY name 's sake , O Lord , pardon mine iniquity ; for it is great .
what man is he that feareth the Lord ? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose .
the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him ; and he will shew them his Covenant .
mine eyes are ever toward the Lord ; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net .
turn thee unto me , and have mercy upon me ; for I am desolate and afflicted .
the troubles of my heart are enlarged : O bring thou me out of my distresses .
O keep my soul , and deliver me : let me not be ashamed ; for I put my trust in thee .
judge me , O Lord ; for I have walked in mine integrity : I have trusted also in the Lord ; therefore I shall not slide .
I have not sat with vain persons , neither will I go in with dissemblers .
I have hated the Congregation of evil doers ; and will not sit with the wicked .
that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving , and tell of all THY wondrous works .
Lord , I have loved the habitation of THY house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth .
but as for me , I will walk in mine integrity : redeem me , and be merciful unto me .
the Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; I will sing , yea , I will sing praises unto the Lord .
hear , O Lord , when I cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me , and answer me .
hide not THY face far from me ; put not THY servant away in anger : thou hast been my help ; leave me not , neither forsake me , O God of my salvation .
teach me THY way , O Lord , and lead me in a plain path , because of mine enemies .
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the Goodness of the Lord in the land of the living .
wait on the Lord : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen thine heart : wait , I say , on the Lord .
unto thee will I cry , O Lord my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if thou be silent to me , I become like them that go down into the pit .
hear the voice of my supplications , when I cry unto thee , when I lift up my hands toward THY holy oracle .
draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of iniquity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mischief is in their hearts .
give them according to their deeds , and according to the wickedness of their endeavours : give them after the work of their hands ; render to them their desert .
because they regard not the works of the Lord , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up .
blessed be the Lord , because he hath heard the voice of my supplications .
the Lord is my strength and my shield ; my heart trusted in him , and I am helped : therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth ; and with my song will I praise him .
the Lord is their strength , and he is the saving strength of his anointed .
give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name ; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness .
the voice of the Lord is upon the waters : the God of glory thundereth : the Lord is upon many waters .
the voice of the Lord is powerful ; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty .
the voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars ; yea , the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon .
he maketh them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn .
the Lord will give strength unto his people ; the Lord will bless his people with peace .
I will extol thee , O Lord ; for thou hast lifted me up , and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me .
O Lord , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave : thou hast kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit .
sing unto the Lord , O ye saints of his , and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness .
for his anger endureth but a moment ; in his favour is life : weeping may endure for a night , but joy cometh in the morning .
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing : thou hast put off my sackcloth , and girded me with gladness ;
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . O Lord my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
in thee , O Lord , do I put my trust ; let me never be ashamed : deliver me in THY righteousness .
pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me : for thou art my strength .
into thine hand I commit my spirit : thou hast redeemed me , O Lord God of truth .
I have hated them that regard lying vanities : but I trust in the Lord .
I will be glad and rejoice in THY mercy : for thou hast considered my trouble ; thou hast known my soul in adversities ;
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast set my feet in a large room .
have mercy upon me , O Lord , for I am in trouble : mine eye is consumed with grief , yea , my soul and my belly .
for my life is spent with grief , and my years with sighing : my strength faileth because of mine iniquity , and my bones are consumed .
I was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind : I am like a broken vessel .
for I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
my times are in THY hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enemies , and from them that persecute me .
make THY face to shine upon THY servant : save me for THY mercies ' sake .
let me not be ashamed , O Lord ; for I have called upon thee : let the wicked be ashamed , and let them be silent in the grave .
Oh how great is THY Goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of THY presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
for I said in my haste , I am cut off from before thine eyes : nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee .
be of good courage , and he shall strengthen your heart , all ye that hope in the Lord .
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven , whose sin is covered .
blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity , and in whose spirit there is no guile .
when I kept silence , my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long .
for day and night THY hand was heavy upon me : my moisture is turned into the drought of summer . Selah .
I acknowledged my sin unto thee , and mine iniquity have I not hid . I said , I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin . Selah .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
Thou art my hiding place ; thou shalt preserve me from trouble ; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance . Selah .
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go : I will guide thee with mine eye .
be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
many sorrows shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the Lord , mercy shall compass him about .
praise the Lord with harp : sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings .
for the word of the Lord is right ; and all his works are done in truth .
he loveth righteousness and judgment : the earth is full of the Goodness of the Lord .
by the word of the Lord were the heavens made ; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth .
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap : he layeth up the depth in storehouses .
let all the earth fear the Lord : let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him .
the Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought : he maketh the devices of the people of none effect .
blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord : and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance .
the Lord looketh from heaven ; he beholdeth all the sons of men .
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth .
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host : a mighty man is not delivered by much strength .
an horse is a vain thing for safety : neither shall he deliver any by his great strength .
behold , the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him , upon them that hope in his mercy ;
to deliver their soul from death , and to keep them alive in famine .
our soul waiteth for the Lord : he is our help and our shield .
for our heart shall rejoice in him , because we have trusted in his holy name .
let THY mercy , O Lord , be upon us , according as we hope in thee .
I will bless the Lord at all times : his praise shall continually be in my mouth .
I sought the Lord , and he heard me , and delivered me from all my fears .
this poor man cried , and the Lord heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles .
the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him , and delivereth them .
O fear the Lord , ye his saints : for there is no want to them that fear him .
the young lions do lack , and suffer hunger : but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing .
come , ye children , hearken unto me : I will teach you the fear of the Lord .
what man is he that desireth life , and loveth many days , that he may see good ?
the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous , and his ears are open unto their cry .
the face of the Lord is against them that do evil , to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth .
the righteous cry , and the Lord heareth , and delivereth them out of all their troubles .
the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart ; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit .
many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the Lord delivereth him out of them all .
he keepeth all his bones : not one of them is broken .
the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants : and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate .
plead my cause , O Lord , with them that strive with me : fight against them that fight against me .
draw out also the spear , and stop the way against them that persecute me : say unto my soul , I am THY salvation .
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
let them be as chaff before the wind : and let the angel of the Lord chase them .
let their way be dark and slippery : and let the angel of the Lord persecute them .
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have digged for my soul .
let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
and my soul shall be joyful in the Lord : it shall rejoice in his salvation .
all my bones shall say , Lord , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
false witnesses did rise up ; they laid to my charge things that I knew not .
but in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
I will give thee thanks in the great Congregation : I will praise thee among much people .
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me : neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause .
for they speak not peace : but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land .
stir up thyself , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my God and my Lord .
judge me , O Lord my God , according to THY righteousness ; and let them not rejoice over me .
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt : let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me .
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let them say continually , Let the Lord be magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
and my tongue shall speak of THY righteousness and of THY praise all the day long .
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart , that there is no fear of God before his eyes .
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes , until his iniquity be found to be hateful .
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit : he hath left off to be wise , and to do good .
he deviseth mischief upon his bed ; he setteth himself in a way that is not good ; he abhorreth not evil .
THY mercy , O Lord , is in the heavens ; and THY faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds .
how excellent is THY lovingkindness , O God ! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of THY wings .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of THY house ; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of THY pleasures .
for with thee is the fountain of life : in THY light shall we see light .
O continue THY lovingkindness unto them that know thee ; and THY righteousness to the upright in heart .
let not the foot of pride come against me , and let not the hand of the wicked remove me .
there are the workers of iniquity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
fret not thyself because of evildoers , neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity .
trust in the Lord , and do good ; so shalt thou dwell in the land , and verily thou shalt be fed .
delight thyself also in the Lord ; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart .
commit THY way unto the Lord ; trust also in him ; and he shall bring it to pass .
rest in the Lord , and wait patiently for him : fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way , because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass .
for evildoers shall be cut off : but those that wait upon the Lord , they shall inherit the earth .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
but the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
their sword shall enter into their own heart , and their bows shall be broken .
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked .
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken : but the Lord upholdeth the righteous .
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time : and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
the wicked borroweth , and payeth not again : but the righteous sheweth mercy , and giveth .
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be Cursed of him shall be cut off .
the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord : and he delighteth in his way .
though he fall , he shall not be utterly cast down : for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand .
I have been young , and now am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread .
for the Lord loveth judgment , and forsaketh not his saints ; they are preserved for ever : but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off .
the law of his God is in his heart ; none of his steps shall slide .
the Lord will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
wait on the Lord , and keep his way , and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land : when the wicked are cut off , thou shalt see it .
yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : yea , I sought him , but he could not be found .
mark the perfect man , and behold the upright : for the end of that man is peace .
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together : the end of the wicked shall be cut off .
but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord : he is their strength in the time of trouble .
and the Lord shall help them and deliver them : he shall deliver them from the wicked , and save them , because they trust in him .
O Lord , rebuke me not in THY wrath : neither chasten me in THY hot displeasure .
for thine arrows stick fast in me , and THY hand presseth me sore .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
for mine iniquities are gone over mine head : as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me .
I am troubled ; I am bowed down greatly ; I go mourning all the day long .
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease : and there is no soundness in my flesh .
I am feeble and sore broken : I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart .
Lord , all my desire is before thee ; and my groaning is not hid from thee .
my heart panteth , my strength faileth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore ; and my kinsmen stand afar off .
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me : and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and imagine deceits all the day long .
but I , as a deaf man , heard not ; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth .
thus I was as a man that heareth not , and in whose mouth are no reproofs .
for I said , Hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me .
for I am ready to halt , and my sorrow is continually before me .
for I will declare mine iniquity ; I will be sorry for my sin .
but mine enemies are lively , and they are strong : and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied .
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries ; because I follow the thing that good is .
I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my tongue : I will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked is before me .
I was dumb with silence , I held my peace , even from good ; and my sorrow was stirred .
my heart was hot within me , while I was musing the fire burned : then spake I with my tongue ,
Lord , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my days , what it is ; that I may know how frail I am .
behold , thou hast made my days as an handbreadth ; and mine age is as nothing before thee : verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity . Selah .
surely every man walketh in a vain shew : surely they are disquieted in vain : he heapeth up riches , and knoweth not who shall gather them .
deliver me from all my transgressions : make me not the reproach of the foolish .
remove THY stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of thine hand .
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity , thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth : surely every man is vanity . Selah .
hear my prayer , O Lord , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not THY peace at my tears : for I am a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as all my fathers were .
O spare me , that I may recover strength , before I go hence , and be no more .
I waited patiently for the Lord ; and he inclined unto me , and heard my cry .
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings .
and he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the Lord .
blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
many , O Lord my God , are THY wonderful works which thou hast done , and THY thoughts which are to us @-@ ward : they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee : if I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be numbered .
sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire ; mine ears hast thou opened : burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required .
I have preached righteousness in the great Congregation : lo , I have not refrained my lips , O Lord , thou knowest .
I have not hid THY righteousness within my heart ; I have declared THY faithfulness and THY salvation : I have not concealed THY lovingkindness and THY truth from the great Congregation .
withhold not thou THY tender mercies from me , O Lord : let THY lovingkindness and THY truth continually preserve me .
for innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it ; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil .
but I am poor and needy ; yet the Lord thinketh upon me : thou art my help and my deliverer ; make no tarrying , O my God .
blessed is he that considereth the poor : the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble .
the Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies .
the Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing : thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness .
and if he come to see me , he speaketh vanity : his heart gathereth iniquity to itself ; when he goeth abroad , he telleth it .
Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me .
but thou , O Lord , be merciful unto me , and raise me up , that I may requite them .
by this I know that thou favourest me , because mine enemy doth not triumph over me .
and as for me , thou upholdest me in mine integrity , and settest me before THY face for ever .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted in me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance .
yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
judge me , O God , and plead my cause against an ungodly nation : O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man .
for thou art the God of my strength : why dost thou cast me off ? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
O send out THY light and THY truth : let them lead me ; let them bring me unto THY holy hill , and to THY tabernacles .
then will I go unto the altar of God , unto God my exceeding joy : yea , upon the harp will I praise thee , O God my God .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
we have heard with our ears , O God , our fathers have told us , what work thou didst in their days , in the times of old .
how thou didst drive out the heathen with THY hand , and plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them : but THY right hand , and thine arm , and the light of THY countenance , because thou hadst a favour unto them .
through thee will we push down our enemies : through THY name will we tread them under that rise up against us .
for I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me .
but thou hast saved us from our enemies , and hast put them to shame that hated us .
but thou hast cast off , and put us to shame ; and goest not forth with our armies .
Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy : and they which hate us spoil for themselves .
Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat ; and hast scattered us among the heathen .
Thou sellest THY people for nought , and dost not increase THY wealth by their price .
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us .
Thou makest us a byword among the heathen , a shaking of the head among the people .
my confusion is continually before me , and the shame of my face hath covered me ,
all this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt falsely in THY Covenant .
our heart is not turned back , neither have our steps declined from THY way ;
though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons , and covered us with the shadow of death .
if we have forgotten the name of our God , or stretched out our hands to a strange god ;
Yea , for THY sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter .
for our soul is bowed down to the dust : our belly cleaveth unto the earth .
my heart is inditing a good matter : I speak of the things which I have made touching the king : my tongue is the pen of a ready writer .
Thou art fairer than the children of men : grace is poured into THY lips : therefore God hath blessed thee for ever .
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king 's enemies ; whereby the people fall under thee .
all THY garments smell of myrrh , and aloes , and cassia , out of the Ivory palaces , whereby they have made thee glad .
Kings ' daughters were among THY honourable women : upon THY right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir .
Hearken , O daughter , and consider , and incline thine ear ; forget also thine own people , and THY father 's house ;
so shall the king greatly desire THY beauty : for he is THY Lord ; and worship thou him .
and the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall intreat THY favour .
she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework : the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee .
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought : they shall enter into the king 's palace .
instead of THY fathers shall be THY children , whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth .
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea ;
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled , though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof . Selah .
there is a river , the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God , the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High .
God is in the midst of her ; she shall not be moved : God shall help her , and that right early .
the heathen raged , the kingdoms were moved : he uttered his voice , the earth melted .
the Lord of hosts is with us ; the God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah .
come , behold the works of the Lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
be still , and know that I am God : I will be exalted among the heathen , I will be exalted in the earth .
for the Lord most high is terrible ; he is a great King over all the earth .
he shall subdue the people under us , and the nations under our feet .
he shall choose our inheritance for us , the excellency of Jacob whom he loved . Selah .
God is gone up with a shout , the Lord with the sound of a trumpet .
God reigneth over the heathen : God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness .
the princes of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Abraham : for the shields of the earth belong unto God : he is greatly exalted .
great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised in the city of our God , in the mountain of his holiness .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount Zion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
for , lo , the kings were assembled , they passed by together .
they saw it , and so they marvelled ; they were troubled , and hasted away .
as we have heard , so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts , in the city of our God : God will establish it for ever . Selah .
according to THY name , O God , so is THY praise unto the ends of the earth : THY right hand is full of righteousness .
let mount Zion rejoice , let the daughters of Judah be glad , because of THY judgments .
walk about Zion , and go round about her : tell the towers thereof .
mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following .
for this God is our God for ever and ever : he will be our guide even unto death .
my mouth shall speak of wisdom ; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding .
I will incline mine ear to a parable : I will open my dark saying upon the harp .
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil , when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about ?
they that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ;
none of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give to God a ransom for him :
( for the redemption of their soul is precious , and it ceaseth for ever : )
for he seeth that wise men die , likewise the fool and the brutish person perish , and leave their wealth to others .
like sheep they are laid in the grave ; death shall feed on them ; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning ; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling .
but God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave : for he shall receive me . Selah .
be not thou afraid when one is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased ;
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away : his glory shall not descend after him .
though while he lived he blessed his soul : and men will praise thee , when thou doest well to thyself .
man that is in honour , and understandeth not , is like the beasts that perish .
the mighty God , even the Lord , hath spoken , and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof .
out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God hath shined .
our God shall come , and shall not keep silence : a fire shall devour before him , and it shall be very tempestuous round about him .
he shall call to the heavens from above , and to the earth , that he may judge his people .
hear , O my people , and I will speak ; O Israel , and I will testify against thee : I am God , even THY God .
I will not reprove thee for THY sacrifices or THY burnt offerings , to have been continually before me .
I will take no bullock out of THY house , nor he goats out of THY folds .
for every beast of the forest is mine , and the cattle upon a thousand hills .
I know all the fowls of the mountains : and the wild beasts of the field are mine .
if I were hungry , I would not tell thee : for the world is mine , and the fulness thereof .
and call upon me in the day of trouble : I will deliver thee , and thou shalt glorify me .
but unto the wicked God saith , What hast thou to do to declare my statutes , or that thou shouldest take my Covenant in THY mouth ?
when thou sawest a thief , then thou consentedst with him , and hast been partaker with adulterers .
Thou sittest and speakest against THY brother ; thou slanderest thine own mother 's son .
these things hast thou done , and I kept silence ; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself : but I will reprove thee , and set them in order before thine eyes .
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me : and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God .
have mercy upon me , O God , according to THY lovingkindness : according unto the multitude of THY tender mercies blot out my transgressions .
for I acknowledge my transgressions : and my sin is ever before me .
against thee , thee only , have I sinned , and done this evil in THY sight : that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest , and be clear when thou judgest .
behold , thou desirest truth in the inward parts : and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom .
purge me with hyssop , and I shall be clean : wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow .
make me to hear joy and gladness ; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice .
hide THY face from my sins , and blot out all mine iniquities .
then will I teach transgressors THY ways ; and sinners shall be converted unto thee .
O Lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall shew forth THY praise .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of THY dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Selah .
the righteous also shall see , and fear , and shall laugh at him :
Lo , this is the man that made not God his strength ; but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness .
but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God : I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever .
I will praise thee for ever , because thou hast done it : and I will wait on THY name ; for it is good before THY saints .
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , that did seek God .
every one of them is gone back : they are altogether become filthy ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge ? who eat up my people as they eat bread : they have not called upon God .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee : thou hast put them to shame , because God hath despised them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion ! when God bringeth back the captivity of his people , Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
for strangers are risen up against me , and oppressors seek after my soul : they have not set God before them . Selah .
behold , God is mine helper : the Lord is with them that uphold my soul .
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble : and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies .
attend unto me , and hear me : I mourn in my complaint , and make a noise ;
because of the voice of the enemy , because of the oppression of the wicked : for they cast iniquity upon me , and in wrath they hate me .
my heart is sore pained within me : and the terrors of death are fallen upon me .
Lo , then would I wander far off , and remain in the wilderness . Selah .
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof : mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it .
for it was not an enemy that reproached me ; then I could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me ; then I would have hid myself from him :
but it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
let death seize upon them , and let them go down quick into hell : for wickedness is in their dwellings , and among them .
as for me , I will call upon God ; and the Lord shall save me .
evening , and morning , and at noon , will I pray , and cry aloud : and he shall hear my voice .
he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me : for there were many with me .
God shall hear , and afflict them , even he that abideth of old . Selah . because they have no changes , therefore they fear not God .
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hath broken his Covenant .
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter , but war was in his heart : his words were softer than oil , yet were they drawn swords .
cast THY burden upon the Lord , and he shall sustain thee : he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved .
but thou , O God , shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction : bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days ; but I will trust in thee .
mine enemies would daily swallow me up : for they be many that fight against me , O thou most High .
what time I am afraid , I will trust in thee .
in God I will praise his word , in God I have put my trust ; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me .
they gather themselves together , they hide themselves , they mark my steps , when they wait for my soul .
Thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into THY bottle : are they not in THY book ?
when I cry unto thee , then shall mine enemies turn back : this I know ; for God is for me .
in God have I put my trust : I will not be afraid what man can do unto me .
for thou hast delivered my soul from death : wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living ?
be merciful unto me , O God , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of THY wings will I make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
I will cry unto God most high ; unto God that performeth all things for me .
he shall send from heaven , and save from the reproach of him that would swallow me up . Selah . God shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
my soul is among lions : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens ; let THY glory be above all the earth .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . Selah .
my heart is fixed , O God , my heart is fixed : I will sing and give praise .
for THY mercy is great unto the heavens , and THY truth unto the clouds .
be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens : let THY glory be above all the earth .
do ye indeed speak righteousness , O Congregation ? do ye judge uprightly , O ye sons of men ?
Yea , in heart ye work wickedness ; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth .
the wicked are estranged from the womb : they go astray as soon as they be born , speaking lies .
their poison is like the poison of a serpent : they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear ;
break their teeth , O God , in their mouth : break out the great teeth of the young lions , O Lord .
let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
as a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
before your pots can feel the thorns , he shall take them away as with a whirlwind , both living , and in his wrath .
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
deliver me from mine enemies , O my God : defend me from them that rise up against me .
for , lo , they lie in wait for my soul : the mighty are gathered against me ; not for my transgression , nor for my sin , O Lord .
they return at evening : they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
but thou , O Lord , shalt laugh at them ; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision .
the God of my mercy shall prevent me : God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies .
Slay them not , lest my people forget : scatter them by THY power ; and bring them down , O Lord our shield .
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speak .
consume them in wrath , consume them , that they may not be : and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth . Selah .
and at evening let them return ; and let them make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
let them wander up and down for meat , and grudge if they be not satisfied .
but I will sing of THY power ; yea , I will sing aloud of THY mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mercy .
O God , thou hast cast us off , thou hast scattered us , thou hast been displeased ; O turn thyself to us again .
Thou hast made the earth to tremble ; thou hast broken it : heal the breaches thereof ; for it shaketh .
Thou hast shewed THY people hard things : thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment .
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah .
God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and Mete out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
Wilt not thou , O God , which hadst cast us off ? and thou , O God , which didst not go out with our armies ?
through God we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee , when my heart is overwhelmed : lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
I will abide in THY tabernacle for ever : I will trust in the covert of THY wings . Selah .
for thou , O God , hast heard my vows : thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear THY name .
Thou wilt prolong the king 's life : and his years as many generations .
he shall abide before God for ever : O prepare mercy and truth , which may preserve him .
so will I sing praise unto THY name for ever , that I may daily perform my vows .
he only is my rock and my salvation ; he is my defence ; I shall not be greatly moved .
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ? ye shall be slain all of you : as a bowing wall shall ye be , and as a tottering fence .
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency : they delight in lies : they bless with their mouth , but they curse inwardly . Selah .
he only is my rock and my salvation : he is my defence ; I shall not be moved .
in God is my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
trust in him at all times ; ye people , pour out your heart before him : God is a refuge for us . Selah .
surely men of low degree are vanity , and men of high degree are a lie : to be laid in the balance , they are altogether lighter than vanity .
trust not in oppression , and become not vain in robbery : if riches increase , set not your heart upon them .
O God , thou art my God ; early will I seek thee : my soul thirsteth for thee , my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land , where no water is ;
to see THY power and THY glory , so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary .
thus will I bless thee while I live : I will lift up my hands in THY name .
my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness ; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips :
because thou hast been my help , therefore in the shadow of THY wings will I rejoice .
but those that seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
they shall fall by the sword : they shall be a portion for foxes .
but the king shall rejoice in God ; every one that sweareth by him shall glory : but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped .
hear my voice , O God , in my prayer : preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked ; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity :
who whet their tongue like a sword , and bend their bows to shoot their arrows , even bitter words :
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
but God shall shoot at them with an arrow ; suddenly shall they be wounded .
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
and all men shall fear , and shall declare the work of God ; for they shall wisely consider of his doing .
Iniquities prevail against me : as for our transgressions , thou shalt purge them away .
blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in THY courts : we shall be satisfied with the Goodness of THY house , even of THY holy temple .
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains ; being girded with power :
which stilleth the noise of the seas , the noise of their waves , and the tumult of the people .
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at THY tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice .
Thou visitest the earth , and waterest it : thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God , which is full of water : thou preparest them corn , when thou hast so provided for it .
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrows thereof : thou makest it soft with showers : thou blessest the springing thereof .
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness : and the little hills rejoice on every side .
the pastures are clothed with flocks ; the valleys also are covered over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
all the earth shall worship thee , and shall sing unto thee ; they shall sing to THY name . Selah .
come and see the works of God : he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men .
he turned the sea into dry land : they went through the flood on foot : there did we rejoice in him .
he ruleth by his power for ever ; his eyes behold the nations : let not the rebellious exalt themselves . Selah .
O bless our God , ye people , and make the voice of his praise to be heard :
which holdeth our soul in life , and suffereth not our feet to be moved .
for thou , O God , hast proved us : thou hast tried us , as silver is tried .
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads ; we went through fire and through water : but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place .
I will go into THY house with burnt offerings : I will pay thee my vows ,
which my lips have uttered , and my mouth hath spoken , when I was in trouble .
I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings , with the incense of rams ; I will offer bullocks with goats . Selah .
I cried unto him with my mouth , and he was extolled with my tongue .
if I regard iniquity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me :
but verily God hath heard me ; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer .
God be merciful unto us , and bless us ; and cause his face to shine upon us ; Selah .
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nations upon earth . Selah .
then shall the earth yield her increase ; and God , even our own God , shall bless us .
let God arise , let his enemies be scattered : let them also that hate him flee before him .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
but let the righteous be glad ; let them rejoice before God : yea , let them exceedingly rejoice .
a father of the fatherless , and a judge of the widows , is God in his holy habitation .
God setteth the solitary in families : he bringeth out those which are bound with chains : but the rebellious dwell in a dry land .
O God , when thou wentest forth before THY people , when thou didst march through the wilderness ; Selah :
the earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
Thou , O God , didst send a plentiful rain , whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance , when it was weary .
THY Congregation hath dwelt therein : thou , O God , hast prepared of THY Goodness for the poor .
though ye have lien among the pots , yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver , and her feathers with yellow gold .
why leap ye , ye high hills ? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in ; yea , the Lord will dwell in it for ever .
the chariots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
Thou hast ascended on high , thou hast led captivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the Lord God might dwell among them .
blessed be the Lord , who daily loadeth us with benefits , even the God of our salvation . Selah .
he that is our God is the God of salvation ; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death .
but God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
the Lord said , I will bring again from Bashan , I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea :
they have seen THY goings , O God ; even the goings of my God , my King , in the sanctuary .
the singers went before , the players on instruments followed after ; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels .
there is little Benjamin with their ruler , the princes of Judah and their council , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali .
princes shall come out of Egypt ; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God .
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
Ascribe ye strength unto God : his excellency is over Israel , and his strength is in the clouds .
save me , O God ; for the waters are come in unto my soul .
I sink in deep mire , where there is no standing : I am come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
I am weary of my crying : my throat is dried : mine eyes fail while I wait for my God .
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are mighty : then I restored that which I took not away .
O God , thou knowest my foolishness ; and my sins are not hid from thee .
let not them that wait on thee , O Lord God of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
because for THY sake I have borne reproach ; shame hath covered my face .
I am become a stranger unto my brethren , and an alien unto my mother 's children .
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me .
when I wept , and chastened my soul with fasting , that was to my reproach .
I made sackcloth also my garment ; and I became a proverb to them .
they that sit in the gate speak against me ; and I was the song of the drunkards .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O Lord , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of THY mercy hear me , in the truth of THY salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and let me not sink : let me be delivered from them that hate me , and out of the deep waters .
let not the waterflood overflow me , neither let the deep swallow me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me .
and hide not THY face from THY servant ; for I am in trouble : hear me speedily .
draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of mine enemies .
reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
they gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink .
let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
let their eyes be darkened , that they see not ; and make their loins continually to shake .
pour out thine indignation upon them , and let THY wrathful anger take hold of them .
let their habitation be desolate ; and let none dwell in their tents .
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten ; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded .
add iniquity unto their iniquity : and let them not come into THY righteousness .
let them be blotted out of the book of the living , and not be written with the righteous .
I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him with Thanksgiving .
the humble shall see this , and be glad : and your heart shall live that seek God .
for God will save Zion , and will build the cities of Judah : that they may dwell there , and have it in possession .
the seed also of his servants shall inherit it : and they that love his name shall dwell therein .
make haste , O God , to deliver me ; make haste to help me , O Lord .
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love THY salvation say continually , Let God be magnified .
but I am poor and needy : make haste unto me , O God : thou art my help and my deliverer ; O Lord , make no tarrying .
deliver me in THY righteousness , and cause me to escape : incline thine ear unto me , and save me .
be thou my strong habitation , whereunto I may continually resort : thou hast given commandment to save me ; for thou art my rock and my fortress .
deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
by thee have I been holden up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother 's bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
let my mouth be filled with THY praise and with THY honour all the day .
cast me not off in the time of old age ; forsake me not when my strength faileth .
for mine enemies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together ,
O God , be not far from me : O my God , make haste for my help .
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
my mouth shall shew forth THY righteousness and THY salvation all the day ; for I know not the numbers thereof .
I will go in the strength of the Lord God : I will make mention of THY righteousness , even of thine only .
O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have I declared THY wondrous works .
now also when I am old and grayheaded , O God , forsake me not ; until I have shewed THY strength unto this generation , and THY power to every one that is to come .
THY righteousness also , O God , is very high , who hast done great things : O God , who is like unto thee !
Thou , which hast shewed me great and sore troubles , shalt quicken me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth .
Thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort me on every side .
I will also praise thee with the psaltery , even THY truth , O my God : unto thee will I sing with the harp , O thou Holy One of Israel .
my tongue also shall talk of THY righteousness all the day long : for they are confounded , for they are brought unto shame , that seek my hurt .
give the king THY judgments , O God , and THY righteousness unto the king 's son .
the mountains shall bring peace to the people , and the little hills , by righteousness .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
in his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth .
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him ; and his enemies shall lick the dust .
the kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents : the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts .
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also , and him that hath no helper .
he shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy .
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence : and precious shall their blood be in his sight .
and he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba : prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall he be praised .
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
and blessed be his glorious name for ever : and let the whole earth be filled with his glory ; Amen , and Amen .
truly God is good to Israel , even to such as are of a clean heart .
but as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh slipped .
for I was envious at the foolish , when I saw the prosperity of the wicked .
for there are no bands in their death : but their strength is firm .
they are not in trouble as other men ; neither are they plagued like other men .
they set their mouth against the heavens , and their tongue walketh through the earth .
therefore his people return hither : and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them .
behold , these are the ungodly , who prosper in the world ; they increase in riches .
surely thou didst set them in slippery places : thou castedst them down into destruction .
how are they brought into desolation , as in a moment ! they are utterly consumed with terrors .
thus my heart was grieved , and I was pricked in my reins .
so foolish was I , and ignorant : I was as a beast before thee .
nevertheless I am continually with thee : thou hast holden me by my right hand .
Thou shalt guide me with THY counsel , and afterward receive me to glory .
whom have I in heaven but thee ? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee .
my flesh and my heart faileth : but God is the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever .
for , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee .
but it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord God , that I may declare all THY works .
O God , why hast thou cast us off for ever ? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of THY pasture ?
remember THY Congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount Zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
lift up THY feet unto the perpetual desolations ; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary .
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees .
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers .
they have cast fire into THY sanctuary , they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of THY name to the ground .
they said in their hearts , Let us destroy them together : they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land .
we see not our signs : there is no more any prophet : neither is there among us any that knoweth how long .
Thou didst divide the sea by THY strength : thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters .
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces , and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness .
O deliver not the soul of THY turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked : forget not the Congregation of THY poor for ever .
have respect unto the Covenant : for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty .
forget not the voice of thine enemies : the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually .
unto thee , O God , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that THY name is near THY wondrous works declare .
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : I bear up the pillars of it . Selah .
but God is the judge : he putteth down one , and setteth up another .
for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup , and the wine is red ; it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drink them .
but I will declare for ever ; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob .
all the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
in Salem also is his tabernacle , and his dwelling place in Zion .
there brake he the arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the battle . Selah .
the stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
at THY rebuke , O God of Jacob , both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep .
Thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in THY sight when once thou art angry ?
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven ; the earth feared , and was still ,
vow , and pay unto the Lord your God : let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared .
he shall cut off the spirit of princes : he is terrible to the kings of the earth .
I cried unto God with my voice , even unto God with my voice ; and he gave ear unto me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sore ran in the night , and ceased not : my soul refused to be comforted .
I remembered God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit was overwhelmed . Selah .
Thou holdest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I cannot speak .
I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
I call to remembrance my song in the night : I commune with mine own heart : and my spirit made diligent search .
I will remember the works of the Lord : surely I will remember THY wonders of old .
THY way , O God , is in the sanctuary : who is so great a God as our God ?
Thou art the God that doest wonders : thou hast declared THY strength among the people .
the waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee ; they were afraid : the depths also were troubled .
the clouds poured out water : the skies sent out a sound : thine arrows also went abroad .
the voice of THY Thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook .
THY way is in the sea , and THY path in the great waters , and THY footsteps are not known .
give ear , O my people , to my law : incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
I will open my mouth in a parable : I will utter dark sayings of old :
which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
we will not hide them from their children , shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , and his strength , and his wonderful works that he hath done .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children :
that the generation to come might know them , even the children which should be born ; who should arise and declare them to their children :
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
the children of Ephraim , being armed , and carrying bows , turned back in the day of battle .
they kept not the Covenant of God , and refused to walk in his law ;
and forgat his works , and his wonders that he had shewed them .
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan .
he divided the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and he made the waters to stand as an heap .
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire .
he clave the rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink as out of the great depths .
he brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust .
behold , he smote the rock , that the waters gushed out , and the streams overflowed ; can he give bread also ? can he provide flesh for his people ?
therefore the Lord heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also came up against Israel ;
because they believed not in God , and trusted not in his salvation :
and had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them of the corn of heaven .
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
he rained flesh also upon them as dust , and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea :
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations .
they were not estranged from their lust . but while their meat was yet in their mouths ,
the wrath of God came upon them , and slew the fattest of them , and smote down the chosen men of Israel .
when he slew them , then they sought him : and they returned and inquired early after God .
and they remembered that God was their rock , and the high God their redeemer .
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth , and they lied unto him with their tongues .
for their heart was not right with him , neither were they stedfast in his Covenant .
but he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
for he remembered that they were but flesh ; a wind that passeth away , and cometh not again .
how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness , and grieve him in the desert !
Yea , they turned back and tempted God , and limited the Holy One of Israel .
they remembered not his hand , nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy .
how he had wrought his signs in Egypt , and his wonders in the field of Zoan :
and had turned their rivers into blood ; and their floods , that they could not drink .
he sent divers sorts of flies among them , which devoured them ; and frogs , which destroyed them .
he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller , and their labour unto the locust .
he gave up their cattle also to the hail , and their flocks to hot thunderbolts .
he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , and indignation , and trouble , by sending evil angels among them .
he made a way to his anger ; he spared not their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ;
and smote all the firstborn in Egypt ; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham :
but made his own people to go forth like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
and he led them on safely , so that they feared not : but the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary , even to this mountain , which his right hand had purchased .
he cast out the heathen also before them , and divided them an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their Graven images .
so that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh , the tent which he placed among men ;
he gave his people over also unto the sword ; and was wroth with his inheritance .
the fire consumed their young men ; and their maidens were not given to marriage .
then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep , and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine .
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts : he put them to a perpetual reproach .
moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph , and chose not the tribe of Ephraim :
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces , like the earth which he hath established for ever .
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart ; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands .
O God , the heathen are come into thine inheritance ; THY holy temple have they defiled ; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps .
the dead bodies of THY servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of THY saints unto the beasts of the earth .
their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem ; and there was none to bury them .
we are become a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and derision to them that are round about us .
pour out THY wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon THY name .
O remember not against us former iniquities : let THY tender mercies speedily prevent us : for we are brought very low .
help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of THY name : and deliver us , and purge away our sins , for THY name 's sake .
Wherefore should the heathen say , Where is their God ? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of THY servants which is shed .
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of THY power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ;
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach , wherewith they have reproached thee , O Lord .
so we THY people and sheep of THY pasture will give thee thanks for ever : we will shew forth THY praise to all generations .
turn us again , O God , and cause THY face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears ; and givest them tears to drink in great measure .
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt : thou hast cast out the heathen , and planted it .
Thou preparedst room before it , and didst cause it to take deep root , and it filled the land .
the hills were covered with the shadow of it , and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars .
she sent out her boughs unto the sea , and her branches unto the river .
why hast thou then broken down her hedges , so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her ?
the Boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of the field doth devour it .
and the vineyard which THY right hand hath planted , and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself .
it is burned with fire , it is cut down : they perish at the rebuke of THY countenance .
let THY hand be upon the man of THY right hand , upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself .
so will not we go back from thee : quicken us , and we will call upon THY name .
for this was a statute for Israel , and a law of the God of Jacob .
this he ordained in Joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of Egypt : where I heard a language that I understood not .
Thou calledst in trouble , and I delivered thee ; I answered thee in the secret place of Thunder : I proved thee at the waters of Meribah . Selah .
hear , O my people , and I will testify unto thee : O Israel , if thou wilt hearken unto me ;
there shall no strange god be in thee ; neither shalt thou worship any strange god .
I am the Lord THY God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt : open THY mouth wide , and I will fill it .
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me , and Israel had walked in my ways !
I should soon have subdued their enemies , and turned my hand against their adversaries .
the haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him : but their time should have endured for ever .
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
keep not thou silence , O God : hold not THY peace , and be not still , O God .
for , lo , thine enemies make a tumult : and they that hate thee have lifted up the head .
they have taken crafty counsel against THY people , and consulted against THY hidden ones .
they have said , Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance .
the tabernacles of Edom , and the Ishmaelites ; of Moab , and the Hagarenes ;
Assur also is joined with them : they have holpen the children of lot . Selah .
do unto them as unto the Midianites ; as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the Brook of Kison :
make their nobles like Oreb , and like Zeeb : yea , all their princes as Zebah , and as Zalmunna :
as the fire burneth a wood , and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire ;
so persecute them with THY tempest , and make them afraid with THY storm .
fill their faces with shame ; that they may seek THY name , O Lord .
let them be confounded and troubled for ever ; yea , let them be put to shame , and perish :
my soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the Lord : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God .
Yea , the sparrow hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , O Lord of hosts , my King , and my God .
blessed are they that dwell in THY house : they will be still praising thee . Selah .
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
they go from strength to strength , every one of them in Zion appeareth before God .
for a day in THY courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
for the Lord God is a sun and shield : the Lord will give grace and glory : no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly .
Lord , thou hast been favourable unto THY land : thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob .
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of THY people , thou hast covered all their sin . Selah .
Thou hast taken away all THY wrath : thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger .
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever ? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations ?
I will hear what God the Lord will speak : for he will speak peace unto his people , and to his saints : but let them not turn again to Folly .
mercy and truth are met together ; righteousness and peace have kissed each other .
truth shall spring out of the earth ; and righteousness shall look down from heaven .
Yea , the Lord shall give that which is good ; and our land shall yield her increase .
Righteousness shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way of his steps .
preserve my soul ; for I am holy : O thou my God , save THY servant that trusteth in thee .
rejoice the soul of THY servant : for unto thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul .
for thou , Lord , art good , and ready to forgive ; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee .
give ear , O Lord , unto my prayer ; and attend to the voice of my supplications .
in the day of my trouble I will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer me .
among the gods there is none like unto thee , O Lord ; neither are there any works like unto THY works .
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee , O Lord ; and shall glorify THY name .
I will praise thee , O Lord my God , with all my heart : and I will glorify THY name for evermore .
for great is THY mercy toward me : and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell .
O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
O turn unto me , and have mercy upon me ; give THY strength unto THY servant , and save the son of thine handmaid .
Shew me a token for good ; that they which hate me may see it , and be ashamed : because thou , Lord , hast holpen me , and comforted me .
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there : all my springs are in thee .
let my prayer come before thee : incline thine ear unto my cry ;
for my soul is full of troubles : and my life draweth nigh unto the grave .
I am counted with them that go down into the pit : I am as a man that hath no strength :
free among the dead , like the slain that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cut off from THY hand .
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit , in darkness , in the deeps .
THY wrath lieth hard upon me , and thou hast afflicted me with all THY waves . Selah .
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I cannot come forth .
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction : Lord , I have called daily upon thee , I have stretched out my hands unto thee .
shall THY lovingkindness be declared in the grave ? or THY faithfulness in destruction ?
shall THY wonders be known in the dark ? and THY righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up : while I suffer THY terrors I am distracted .
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me , and mine acquaintance into darkness .
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever : with my mouth will I make known THY faithfulness to all generations .
for I have said , Mercy shall be built up for ever : THY faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens .
and the heavens shall praise THY wonders , O Lord : THY faithfulness also in the Congregation of the saints .
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord ? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord ?
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him .
Thou rulest the raging of the sea : when the waves thereof arise , thou stillest them .
Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces , as one that is slain ; thou hast scattered thine enemies with THY strong arm .
the heavens are thine , the earth also is thine : as for the world and the fulness thereof , thou hast founded them .
Thou hast a mighty arm : strong is THY hand , and high is THY right hand .
justice and judgment are the habitation of THY throne : mercy and truth shall go before THY face .
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , O Lord , in the light of THY countenance .
in THY name shall they rejoice all the day : and in THY righteousness shall they be exalted .
for thou art the glory of their strength : and in THY favour our Horn shall be exalted .
for the Lord is our defence ; and the Holy One of Israel is our king .
then thou spakest in vision to THY holy one , and saidst , I have laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of the people .
I have found David my servant ; with my holy oil have I anointed him :
the enemy shall not exact upon him ; nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
and I will beat down his foes before his face , and plague them that hate him .
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him : and in my name shall his Horn be exalted .
I will set his hand also in the sea , and his right hand in the rivers .
he shall cry unto me , Thou art my father , my God , and the rock of my salvation .
my mercy will I keep for him for evermore , and my Covenant shall stand fast with him .
his seed also will I make to endure for ever , and his throne as the days of heaven .
if they break my statutes , and keep not my commandments ;
then will I visit their transgression with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail .
my Covenant will I not break , nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips .
Thou hast made void the Covenant of THY servant : thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground .
Thou hast broken down all his hedges ; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin .
all that pass by the way spoil him : he is a reproach to his neighbours .
Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword , and hast not made him to stand in the battle .
Thou hast made his glory to cease , and cast his throne down to the ground .
the days of his youth hast thou shortened : thou hast covered him with shame . Selah .
what man is he that liveth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? Selah .
before the mountains were brought forth , or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , thou art God .
for a thousand years in THY sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night .
Thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up .
in the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and withereth .
for we are consumed by thine anger , and by THY wrath are we troubled .
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee , our secret sins in the light of THY countenance .
for all our days are passed away in THY wrath : we spend our years as a tale that is told .
the days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
who knoweth the power of thine anger ? even according to THY fear , so is THY wrath .
so teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom .
O satisfy us early with THY mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us , and the years wherein we have seen evil .
let THY work appear unto THY servants , and THY glory unto their children .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty .
surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , and from the noisome pestilence .
he shall cover thee with his feathers , and under his wings shalt thou trust : his truth shall be THY shield and buckler .
a thousand shall fall at THY side , and ten thousand at THY right hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee .
because thou hast made the Lord , which is my refuge , even the most High , THY habitation ;
there shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh THY dwelling .
they shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash THY foot against a stone .
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet .
because he hath set his love upon me , therefore will I deliver him : I will set him on high , because he hath known my name .
he shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
for thou , Lord , hast made me glad through THY work : I will triumph in the works of THY hands .
when the wicked spring as the grass , and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish ; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever :
for , lo , thine enemies , O Lord , for , lo , thine enemies shall perish ; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered .
but my Horn shalt thou exalt like the Horn of an unicorn : I shall be anointed with fresh oil .
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies , and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me .
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree : he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon .
those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God .
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age ; they shall be fat and flourishing ;
the Lord reigneth , he is clothed with majesty ; the Lord is clothed with strength , wherewith he hath girded himself : the world also is stablished , that it cannot be moved .
the floods have lifted up , O Lord , the floods have lifted up their voice ; the floods lift up their waves .
the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters , yea , than the mighty waves of the sea .
how long shall they utter and speak hard things ? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves ?
he that planted the ear , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
he that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
the Lord knoweth the thoughts of man , that they are vanity .
blessed is the man whom thou chastenest , O Lord , and teachest him out of THY law ;
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit be digged for the wicked .
for the Lord will not cast off his people , neither will he forsake his inheritance .
who will rise up for me against the evildoers ? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity ?
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ?
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
but the Lord is my defence ; and my God is the rock of my refuge .
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; yea , the Lord our God shall cut them off .
O come , let us sing unto the Lord : let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation .
let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms .
in his hand are the deep places of the earth : the strength of the hills is his also .
O come , let us worship and bow down : let us kneel before the Lord our maker .
for he is our God ; and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand . to day if ye will hear his voice ,
harden not your heart , as in the provocation , and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
forty years long was I grieved with this generation , and said , It is a people that do err in their heart , and they have not known my ways :
sing unto the Lord , bless his name ; shew forth his salvation from day to day .
for the Lord is great , and greatly to be praised : he is to be feared above all gods .
for all the gods of the nations are idols : but the Lord made the heavens .
give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come into his courts .
say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth : the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved : he shall judge the people righteously .
let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof .
the Lord reigneth ; let the earth rejoice ; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof .
the hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth .
Confounded be all they that serve Graven images , that boast themselves of idols : worship him , all ye gods .
Zion heard , and was glad ; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of THY judgments , O Lord .
Ye that love the Lord , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
O sing unto the Lord a new song ; for he hath done marvellous things : his right hand , and his holy arm , hath gotten him the victory .
the Lord hath made known his salvation : his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen .
he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel : all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God .
make a joyful noise unto the Lord , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
sing unto the Lord with the harp ; with the harp , and the voice of a psalm .
let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
let the floods clap their hands : let the hills be joyful together
Exalt ye the Lord our God , and worship at his footstool ; for he is holy .
Moses and Aaron among his priests , and Samuel among them that call upon his name ; they called upon the Lord , and he answered them .
he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar : they kept his testimonies , and the ordinance that he gave them .
Thou answeredst them , O Lord our God : thou wast a God that forgavest them , though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions .
know ye that the Lord he is God : it is he that hath made us , and not we ourselves ; we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
for the Lord is good ; his mercy is everlasting ; and his truth endureth to all generations .
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way . O when wilt thou come unto me ? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes : I hate the work of them that turn aside ; it shall not cleave to me .
a froward heart shall depart from me : I will not know a wicked person .
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour , him will I cut off : him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer .
mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me : he that walketh in a perfect way , he shall serve me .
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight .
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land ; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord .
hide not THY face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; incline thine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me speedily .
my heart is smitten , and withered like grass ; so that I forget to eat my bread .
I am like a pelican of the wilderness : I am like an owl of the desert .
Thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon Zion : for the time to favour her , yea , the set time , is come .
for THY servants take pleasure in her stones , and favour the dust thereof .
so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord , and all the kings of the earth THY glory .
this shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord .
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary ; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth ;
to hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that are appointed to death ;
of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth : and the heavens are the work of THY hands .
they shall perish , but thou shalt endure : yea , all of them shall wax old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shall be changed :
but thou art the same , and THY years shall have no end .
he made known his ways unto Moses , his acts unto the children of Israel .
he will not always chide : neither will he keep his anger for ever .
he hath not dealt with us after our sins ; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities .
as far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us .
as for man , his days are as grass : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .
for the wind passeth over it , and it is gone ; and the place thereof shall know it no more .
but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children 's children ;
the Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his kingdom ruleth over all .
bless the Lord , ye his angels , that excel in strength , that do his commandments , hearkening unto the voice of his word .
bless the Lord , O my soul . O Lord my God , thou art very great ; thou art clothed with honour and majesty .
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment : who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain :
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters : who maketh the clouds his chariot : who walketh upon the wings of the wind :
who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flaming fire :
who laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be removed for ever .
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment : the waters stood above the mountains .
at THY rebuke they fled ; at the voice of THY Thunder they hasted away .
they go up by the mountains ; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them .
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over ; that they turn not again to cover the earth .
he sendeth the springs into the valleys , which run among the hills .
they give drink to every beast of the field : the wild asses quench their thirst .
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation , which sing among the branches .
he watereth the hills from his chambers : the earth is satisfied with the fruit of THY works .
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man 's heart .
the trees of the Lord are full of SAP ; the cedars of Lebanon , which he hath planted ;
where the birds make their nests : as for the stork , the fir trees are her house .
the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats ; and the rocks for the conies .
Thou makest darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth .
the sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their dens .
O Lord , how manifold are THY works ! in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of THY riches .
so is this great and wide sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable , both small and great beasts .
there go the ships : there is that leviathan , whom thou hast made to play therein .
these wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season .
that thou givest them they gather : thou openest thine hand , they are filled with good .
Thou hidest THY face , they are troubled : thou takest away their breath , they die , and return to their dust .
Thou sendest forth THY spirit , they are created : and thou renewest the face of the earth .
the glory of the Lord shall endure for ever : the Lord shall rejoice in his works .
he looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hills , and they smoke .
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live : I will sing praise to my God while I have my being .
let the sinners be consumed out of the earth , and let the wicked be no more . bless thou the Lord , O my soul . praise ye the Lord .
O give thanks unto the Lord ; call upon his name : make known his deeds among the people .
sing unto him , sing psalms unto him : talk ye of all his wondrous works .
glory ye in his holy name : let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord .
he is the Lord our God : his judgments are in all the earth .
and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law , and to Israel for an everlasting Covenant :
when they were but a few men in number ; yea , very few , and strangers in it .
when they went from one nation to another , from one kingdom to another people ;
moreover he called for a famine upon the land : he brake the whole staff of bread .
he sent a man before them , even Joseph , who was sold for a servant :
until the time that his word came : the word of the Lord tried him .
the king sent and loosed him ; even the ruler of the people , and let him go free .
their land brought forth frogs in abundance , in the chambers of their kings .
he spake , and there came divers sorts of flies , and lice in all their coasts .
he smote their vines also and their fig trees ; and brake the trees of their coasts .
he spake , and the locusts came , and caterpillers , and that without number ,
and did eat up all the herbs in their land , and devoured the fruit of their ground .
he smote also all the firstborn in their land , the chief of all their strength .
he brought them forth also with silver and gold : and there was not one feeble person among their tribes .
the people asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of heaven .
he opened the rock , and the waters gushed out ; they ran in the dry places like a river .
and gave them the lands of the heathen : and they inherited the labour of the people ;
praise ye the Lord . O give thanks unto the Lord ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord ? who can shew forth all his praise ?
blessed are they that keep judgment , and he that doeth righteousness at all times .
remember me , O Lord , with the favour that thou bearest unto THY people : O visit me with THY salvation ;
that I may see the good of THY chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of THY nation , that I may glory with thine inheritance .
our fathers understood not THY wonders in Egypt ; they remembered not the multitude of THY mercies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at the Red sea .
nevertheless he saved them for his name 's sake , that he might make his mighty power to be known .
he rebuked the Red sea also , and it was dried up : so he led them through the depths , as through the wilderness .
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
and the waters covered their enemies : there was not one of them left .
they envied Moses also in the camp , and Aaron the saint of the Lord .
and a fire was kindled in their company ; the flame burned up the wicked .
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , lest he should destroy them .
but murmured in their tents , and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord .
therefore he lifted up his hand against them , to overthrow them in the wilderness :
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions : and the plague brake in upon them .
then stood up Phinehas , and executed judgment : and so the plague was stayed .
they angered him also at the waters of strife , so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes :
because they provoked his spirit , so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips .
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
thus were they defiled with their own works , and went a whoring with their own inventions .
therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people , insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance .
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen ; and they that hated them ruled over them .
their enemies also oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their hand .
many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with their counsel , and were brought low for their iniquity .
and he remembered for them his Covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his mercies .
he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives .
save us , O Lord our God , and gather us from among the heathen , to give thanks unto THY holy name , and to triumph in THY praise .
let the redeemed of the Lord say so , whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy ;
and gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they found no city to dwell in .
then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their distresses .
and he led them forth by the right way , that they might go to a city of habitation .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound in affliction and iron ;
because they rebelled against the words of God , and contemned the counsel of the most High :
therefore he brought down their heart with labour ; they fell down , and there was none to help .
then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses .
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and brake their bands in sunder .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he hath broken the gates of brass , and cut the bars of iron in sunder .
fools because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat ; and they draw near unto the gates of death .
then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and he saveth them out of their distresses .
he sent his word , and healed them , and delivered them from their destructions .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving , and declare his works with rejoicing .
they that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ;
these see the works of the Lord , and his wonders in the deep .
they mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : their soul is melted because of trouble .
they reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ' end .
then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and he bringeth them out of their distresses .
he maketh the storm a calm , so that the waves thereof are still .
then are they glad because they be quiet ; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven .
Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
let them exalt him also in the Congregation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the elders .
he turneth rivers into a wilderness , and the watersprings into dry ground ;
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water , and dry ground into watersprings .
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare a city for habitation ;
and sow the fields , and plant vineyards , which may yield fruits of increase .
he blesseth them also , so that they are multiplied greatly ; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease .
he poureth contempt upon princes , and causeth them to wander in the wilderness , where there is no way .
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction , and maketh him families like a flock .
the righteous shall see it , and rejoice : and all iniquity shall stop her mouth .
Whoso is wise , and will observe these things , even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord .
O God , my heart is fixed ; I will sing and give praise , even with my glory .
I will praise thee , O Lord , among the people : and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations .
for THY mercy is great above the heavens : and THY truth reacheth unto the clouds .
God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and Mete out the valley of Succoth .
Gilead is mine ; Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
Wilt not thou , O God , who hast cast us off ? and wilt not thou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
through God we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying tongue .
they compassed me about also with words of hatred ; and fought against me without a cause .
and they have rewarded me evil for good , and hatred for my love .
when he shall be judged , let him be condemned : and let his prayer become sin .
let his children be continually vagabonds , and beg : let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places .
let the extortioner catch all that he hath ; and let the strangers spoil his labour .
let there be none to extend mercy unto him : neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children .
let his posterity be cut off ; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord ; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out .
let them be before the Lord continually , that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth .
because that he remembered not to shew mercy , but persecuted the poor and needy man , that he might even slay the broken in heart .
as he loved cursing , so let it come unto him : as he delighted not in blessing , so let it be far from him .
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment , so let it come into his bowels like water , and like oil into his bones .
let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him , and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually .
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord , and of them that speak evil against my soul .
but do thou for me , O God the Lord , for THY name 's sake : because THY mercy is good , deliver thou me .
for I am poor and needy , and my heart is wounded within me .
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth : I am tossed up and down as the locust .
I became also a reproach unto them : when they looked upon me they shaked their heads .
let them curse , but bless thou : when they arise , let them be ashamed ; but let THY servant rejoice .
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame , and let them cover themselves with their own confusion , as with a mantle .
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth ; yea , I will praise him among the multitude .
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor , to save him from those that condemn his soul .
the Lord shall send the rod of THY strength out of Zion : rule thou in the midst of thine enemies .
THY people shall be willing in the day of THY power , in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning : thou hast the dew of THY youth .
he shall judge among the heathen , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ; he shall wound the heads over many countries .
he shall drink of the Brook in the way : therefore shall he lift up the head .
praise ye the Lord . I will praise the Lord with my whole heart , in the assembly of the upright , and in the Congregation .
the works of the Lord are great , sought out of all them that have pleasure therein .
he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered : the Lord is gracious and full of compassion .
he hath given meat unto them that fear him : he will ever be mindful of his Covenant .
he hath shewed his people the power of his works , that he may give them the heritage of the heathen .
they stand fast for ever and ever , and are done in truth and uprightness .
he sent redemption unto his people : he hath commanded his Covenant for ever : Holy and reverend is his name .
his seed shall be mighty upon earth : the generation of the upright shall be blessed .
unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness : he is gracious , and full of compassion , and righteous .
surely he shall not be moved for ever : the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance .
he shall not be afraid of evil tidings : his heart is fixed , trusting in the Lord .
his heart is established , he shall not be afraid , until he see his desire upon his enemies .
he hath dispersed , he hath given to the poor ; his righteousness endureth for ever ; his Horn shall be exalted with honour .
the wicked shall see it , and be grieved ; he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away : the desire of the wicked shall perish .
blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore .
from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord 's name is to be praised .
the Lord is high above all nations , and his glory above the heavens .
who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven , and in the earth !
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill ;
that he may set him with princes , even with the princes of his people .
not unto us , O Lord , not unto us , but unto THY name give glory , for THY mercy , and for THY truth 's sake .
but our God is in the heavens : he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased .
they have mouths , but they speak not : eyes have they , but they see not :
they have ears , but they hear not : noses have they , but they smell not :
they have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their throat .
they that make them are like unto them ; so is every one that trusteth in them .
O house of Aaron , trust in the Lord : he is their help and their shield .
Ye that fear the Lord , trust in the Lord : he is their help and their shield .
the Lord hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron .
the Lord shall increase you more and more , you and your children .
the heaven , even the heavens , are the Lord 's : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
I love the Lord , because he hath heard my voice and my supplications .
because he hath inclined his ear unto me , therefore will I call upon him as long as I live .
the sorrows of death compassed me , and the pains of hell gat hold upon me : I found trouble and sorrow .
Gracious is the Lord , and righteous ; yea , our God is merciful .
the Lord preserveth the simple : I was brought low , and he helped me .
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living .
I will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the Lord .
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people .
precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints .
O Lord , truly I am THY servant ; I am THY servant , and the son of thine handmaid : thou hast loosed my bonds .
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving , and will call upon the name of the Lord .
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people ,
I called upon the Lord in distress : the Lord answered me , and set me in a large place .
the Lord is on my side ; I will not fear : what can man do unto me ?
the Lord taketh my part with them that help me : therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me .
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man .
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes .
all nations compassed me about : but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them .
they compassed me about ; yea , they compassed me about : but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
they compassed me about like bees ; they are quenched as the fire of thorns : for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them .
the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous : the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly .
I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the Lord .
the Lord hath chastened me sore : but he hath not given me over unto death .
open to me the gates of righteousness : I will go into them , and I will praise the Lord :
I will praise thee : for thou hast heard me , and art become my salvation .
the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner .
this is the day which the Lord hath made ; we will rejoice and be glad in it .
blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord : we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord .
Thou art my God , and I will praise thee : thou art my God , I will exalt thee .
blessed are they that keep his testimonies , and that seek him with the whole heart .
then shall I not be ashamed , when I have respect unto all THY commandments .
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart , when I shall have learned THY righteous judgments .
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? by taking heed thereto according to THY word .
with my whole heart have I sought thee : O let me not wander from THY commandments .
THY word have I hid in mine heart , that I might not sin against thee .
with my lips have I declared all the judgments of THY mouth .
I have rejoiced in the way of THY testimonies , as much as in all riches .
I will meditate in THY precepts , and have respect unto THY ways .
I will delight myself in THY statutes : I will not forget THY word .
deal bountifully with THY servant , that I may live , and keep THY word .
open thou mine eyes , that I may behold wondrous things out of THY law .
I am a stranger in the earth : hide not THY commandments from me .
my soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto THY judgments at all times .
Thou hast rebuked the proud that are Cursed , which do err from THY commandments .
I have declared my ways , and thou heardest me : teach me THY statutes .
make me to understand the way of THY precepts : so shall I talk of THY wondrous works .
remove from me the way of lying : and grant me THY law graciously .
I have chosen the way of truth : THY judgments have I laid before me .
I will run the way of THY commandments , when thou shalt enlarge my heart .
give me understanding , and I shall keep THY law ; yea , I shall observe it with my whole heart .
make me to go in the path of THY commandments ; for therein do I delight .
turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity ; and quicken thou me in THY way .
let THY mercies come also unto me , O Lord , even THY salvation , according to THY word .
so shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me : for I trust in THY word .
and take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth ; for I have hoped in THY judgments .
I will speak of THY testimonies also before kings , and will not be ashamed .
and I will delight myself in THY commandments , which I have loved .
my hands also will I lift up unto THY commandments , which I have loved ; and I will meditate in THY statutes .
remember the word unto THY servant , upon which thou hast caused me to hope .
the proud have had me greatly in derision : yet have I not declined from THY law .
horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake THY law .
I have remembered THY name , O Lord , in the night , and have kept THY law .
I intreated THY favour with my whole heart : be merciful unto me according to THY word .
the bands of the wicked have robbed me : but I have not forgotten THY law .
at midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of THY righteous judgments .
I am a companion of all them that fear thee , and of them that keep THY precepts .
the earth , O Lord , is full of THY mercy : teach me THY statutes .
Thou hast dealt well with THY servant , O Lord , according unto THY word .
the proud have forged a lie against me : but I will keep THY precepts with my whole heart .
it is good for me that I have been afflicted ; that I might learn THY statutes .
THY hands have made me and fashioned me : give me understanding , that I may learn THY commandments .
they that fear thee will be glad when they see me ; because I have hoped in THY word .
I know , O Lord , that THY judgments are right , and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me .
let , I pray thee , THY merciful kindness be for my comfort , according to THY word unto THY servant .
let THY tender mercies come unto me , that I may live : for THY law is my delight .
let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause : but I will meditate in THY precepts .
let those that fear thee turn unto me , and those that have known THY testimonies .
for I am become like a bottle in the smoke ; yet do I not forget THY statutes .
how many are the days of THY servant ? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me ?
the proud have digged pits for me , which are not after THY law .
Quicken me after THY lovingkindness ; so shall I keep the testimony of THY mouth .
THY faithfulness is unto all generations : thou hast established the earth , and it abideth .
the wicked have waited for me to destroy me : but I will consider THY testimonies .
Thou through THY commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies : for they are ever with me .
I have more understanding than all my teachers : for THY testimonies are my meditation .
I have refrained my feet from every evil way , that I might keep THY word .
I have not departed from THY judgments : for thou hast taught me .
how sweet are THY words unto my taste ! yea , sweeter than honey to my mouth !
THY word is a lamp unto my feet , and a light unto my path .
I have sworn , and I will perform it , that I will keep THY righteous judgments .
accept , I beseech thee , the freewill offerings of my mouth , O Lord , and teach me THY judgments .
my soul is continually in my hand : yet do I not forget THY law .
the wicked have laid a snare for me : yet I erred not from THY precepts .
THY testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever : for they are the rejoicing of my heart .
I have inclined mine heart to perform THY statutes alway , even unto the end .
uphold me according unto THY word , that I may live : and let me not be ashamed of my hope .
hold thou me up , and I shall be safe : and I will have respect unto THY statutes continually .
Thou hast trodden down all them that err from THY statutes : for their deceit is falsehood .
Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross : therefore I love THY testimonies .
my flesh trembleth for fear of thee ; and I am afraid of THY judgments .
deal with THY servant according unto THY mercy , and teach me THY statutes .
it is time for thee , Lord , to work : for they have made void THY law .
therefore I esteem all THY precepts concerning all things to be right ; and I hate every false way .
look thou upon me , and be merciful unto me , as thou usest to do unto those that love THY name .
deliver me from the oppression of man : so will I keep THY precepts .
THY righteousness is an everlasting righteousness , and THY law is the truth .
trouble and anguish have taken hold on me : yet THY commandments are my delights .
I cried unto thee ; save me , and I shall keep THY testimonies .
I prevented the dawning of the morning , and cried : I hoped in THY word .
they draw nigh that follow after mischief : they are far from THY law .
concerning THY testimonies , I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever .
I beheld the transgressors , and was grieved ; because they kept not THY word .
THY word is true from the beginning : and every one of THY righteous judgments endureth for ever .
princes have persecuted me without a cause : but my heart standeth in awe of THY word .
I have kept THY precepts and THY testimonies : for all my ways are before thee .
let my cry come near before thee , O Lord : give me understanding according to THY word .
I have longed for THY salvation , O Lord ; and THY law is my delight .
I have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek THY servant ; for I do not forget THY commandments .
in my distress I cried unto the Lord , and he heard me .
what shall be given unto thee ? or what shall be done unto thee , thou false tongue ?
Woe is me , that I sojourn in Mesech , that I dwell in the tents of Kedar !
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the Lord , which made heaven and earth .
he will not suffer THY foot to be moved : he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
the Lord is THY keeper : the Lord is THY shade upon THY right hand .
the sun shall not smite thee by day , nor the moon by night .
the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve THY soul .
the Lord shall preserve THY going out and THY coming in from this time forth , and even for evermore .
Whither the tribes go up , the tribes of the Lord , unto the testimony of Israel , to give thanks unto the name of the Lord .
for there are set thrones of judgment , the thrones of the house of David .
unto thee lift I up mine eyes , O thou that dwellest in the heavens .
behold , as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters , and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God , until that he have mercy upon us .
have mercy upon us , O Lord , have mercy upon us : for we are exceedingly filled with contempt .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side , now may Israel say ;
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side , when men rose up against us :
then the waters had overwhelmed us , the stream had gone over our soul :
blessed be the Lord , who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth .
our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers : the snare is broken , and we are escaped .
our help is in the name of the Lord , who made heaven and earth .
they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion , which cannot be removed , but abideth for ever .
as the mountains are round about Jerusalem , so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever .
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous ; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity .
do good , O Lord , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing : then said they among the heathen , The Lord hath done great things for them .
he that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him .
except the Lord build the house , they labour in vain that build it : except the Lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrows : for so he giveth his beloved sleep .
Lo , children are an heritage of the Lord : and the fruit of the womb is his reward .
as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man ; so are children of the youth .
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate .
blessed is every one that feareth the Lord ; that walketh in his ways .
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
THY wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house : THY children like olive plants round about THY table .
behold , that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord .
the Lord shall bless thee out of Zion : and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of THY life .
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth : yet they have not prevailed against me .
the Lord is righteous : he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked .
let them be as the grass upon the housetops , which withereth afore it groweth up :
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom .
neither do they which go by say , The blessing of the Lord be upon you : we bless you in the name of the Lord .
out of the depths have I cried unto thee , O Lord .
Lord , hear my voice : let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications .
I wait for the Lord , my soul doth wait , and in his word do I hope .
my soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning : I say , more than they that watch for the morning .
let Israel hope in the Lord : for with the Lord there is mercy , and with him is plenteous redemption .
Lord , my heart is not haughty , nor mine eyes lofty : neither do I exercise myself in great matters , or in things too high for me .
surely I have behaved and quieted myself , as a child that is weaned of his mother : my soul is even as a weaned child .
Lord , remember David , and all his afflictions :
surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house , nor go up into my bed ;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes , or slumber to mine eyelids ,
Lo , we heard of it at Ephratah : we found it in the fields of the wood .
let THY priests be clothed with righteousness ; and let THY saints shout for joy .
the Lord hath sworn in truth unto David ; he will not turn from it ; Of the fruit of THY body will I set upon THY throne .
if THY children will keep my Covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them , their children shall also sit upon THY throne for evermore .
I will abundantly bless her provision : I will satisfy her poor with bread .
I will also clothe her priests with salvation : and her saints shall shout aloud for joy .
behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity !
it is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron 's beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
as the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the Lord commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
behold , bless ye the Lord , all ye servants of the Lord , which by night stand in the house of the Lord .
for I know that the Lord is great , and that our Lord is above all gods .
whatsoever the Lord pleased , that did he in heaven , and in earth , in the seas , and all deep places .
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain ; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries .
who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee , O Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his servants .
Sihon king of the Amorites , and Og king of Bashan , and all the kingdoms of Canaan :
THY name , O Lord , endureth for ever ; and THY memorial , O Lord , throughout all generations .
for the Lord will judge his people , and he will repent himself concerning his servants .
the idols of the heathen are silver and gold , the work of men 's hands .
they have mouths , but they speak not ; eyes have they , but they see not ;
they have ears , but they hear not ; neither is there any breath in their mouths .
they that make them are like unto them : so is every one that trusteth in them .
O give thanks unto the God of gods : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him that by wisdom made the heavens : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him that stretched out the earth above the waters : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him that made great lights : for his mercy endureth for ever :
to him that smote Egypt in their firstborn : for his mercy endureth for ever :
to him which divided the Red sea into parts : for his mercy endureth for ever :
and made Israel to pass through the midst of it : for his mercy endureth for ever :
but overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him which led his people through the wilderness : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him which smote great kings : for his mercy endureth for ever :
who remembered us in our low estate : for his mercy endureth for ever :
and hath redeemed us from our enemies : for his mercy endureth for ever .
O give thanks unto the God of heaven : for his mercy endureth for ever .
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof .
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , sing us one of the songs of Zion .
how shall we sing the Lord 's song in a strange land ?
if I forget thee , O Jerusalem , let my right hand forget her cunning .
if I do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy .
remember , O Lord , the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem ; who said , Rase it , rase it , even to the foundation thereof .
O daughter of Babylon , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us .
happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth THY little ones against the stones .
I will worship toward THY holy temple , and praise THY name for THY lovingkindness and for THY truth : for thou hast magnified THY word above all THY name .
Yea , they shall sing in the ways of the Lord : for great is the glory of the Lord .
though the Lord be high , yet hath he respect unto the lowly : but the proud he knoweth afar off .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and THY right hand shall save me .
the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me : THY mercy , O Lord , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .
for there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O Lord , thou knowest it altogether .
Thou hast beset me behind and before , and laid thine hand upon me .
such knowledge is too wonderful for me ; it is high , I cannot attain unto it .
Whither shall I go from THY spirit ? or whither shall I flee from THY presence ?
if I ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if I make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
if I take the wings of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
Yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee .
for thou hast possessed my reins : thou hast covered me in my mother 's womb .
I will praise thee ; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made : marvellous are THY works ; and that my soul knoweth right well .
my substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
Thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in THY book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
how precious also are THY thoughts unto me , O God ! how great is the sum of them !
if I should count them , they are more in number than the sand : when I awake , I am still with thee .
do not I hate them , O Lord , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
deliver me , O Lord , from the evil man : preserve me from the violent man ;
which imagine mischiefs in their heart ; continually are they gathered together for war .
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent ; adders ' poison is under their lips . Selah .
keep me , O Lord , from the hands of the wicked ; preserve me from the violent man ; who have purposed to overthrow my goings .
the proud have hid a snare for me , and cords ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gins for me . Selah .
O God the Lord , the strength of my salvation , thou hast covered my head in the day of battle .
grant not , O Lord , the desires of the wicked : further not his wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves . Selah .
as for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
let burning coals fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep pits , that they rise not up again .
let not an evil speaker be established in the earth : evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted , and the right of the poor .
surely the righteous shall give thanks unto THY name : the upright shall dwell in THY presence .
Lord , I cry unto thee : make haste unto me ; give ear unto my voice , when I cry unto thee .
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
set a watch , O Lord , before my mouth ; keep the door of my lips .
Incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties .
let the righteous smite me ; it shall be a kindness : and let him reprove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities .
when their judges are overthrown in stony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are sweet .
our bones are scattered at the grave 's mouth , as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth .
but mine eyes are unto thee , O God the Lord : in thee is my trust ; leave not my soul destitute .
keep me from the snares which they have laid for me , and the gins of the workers of iniquity .
I cried unto the Lord with my voice ; with my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication .
I poured out my complaint before him ; I shewed before him my trouble .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , then thou knewest my path . in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
I looked on my right hand , and beheld , but there was no man that would know me : refuge failed me ; no man cared for my soul .
attend unto my cry ; for I am brought very low : deliver me from my persecutors ; for they are stronger than I.
bring my soul out of prison , that I may praise THY name : the righteous shall compass me about ; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me .
hear my prayer , O Lord , give ear to my supplications : in THY faithfulness answer me , and in THY righteousness .
and enter not into judgment with THY servant : for in THY sight shall no man living be justified .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me ; my heart within me is desolate .
I remember the days of old ; I meditate on all THY works ; I muse on the work of THY hands .
I stretch forth my hands unto thee : my soul thirsteth after thee , as a thirsty land . Selah .
hear me speedily , O Lord : my spirit faileth : hide not THY face from me , lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit .
cause me to hear THY lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
deliver me , O Lord , from mine enemies : I flee unto thee to hide me .
teach me to do THY will ; for thou art my God : THY spirit is good ; lead me into the land of uprightness .
Quicken me , O Lord , for THY name 's sake : for THY righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
and of THY mercy cut off mine enemies , and destroy all them that afflict my soul : for I am THY servant .
blessed be the Lord my strength , which teacheth my hands to war , and my fingers to fight :
my Goodness , and my fortress ; my high tower , and my deliverer ; my shield , and he in whom I trust ; who subdueth my people under me .
Lord , what is man , that thou takest knowledge of him ! or the son of man , that thou makest account of him !
bow THY heavens , O Lord , and come down : touch the mountains , and they shall smoke .
send thine hand from above ; rid me , and deliver me out of great waters , from the hand of strange children ;
it is he that giveth salvation unto kings : who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword .
rid me , and deliver me from the hand of strange children , whose mouth speaketh vanity , and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood :
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth ; that our daughters may be as corner stones , polished after the similitude of a palace :
that our garners may be full , affording all manner of store : that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets :
that our oxen may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor going out ; that there be no complaining in our streets .
happy is that people , that is in such a case : yea , happy is that people , whose God is the Lord .
I will extol thee , my God , O king ; and I will bless THY name for ever and ever .
every day will I bless thee ; and I will praise THY name for ever and ever .
one generation shall praise THY works to another , and shall declare THY mighty acts .
I will speak of the glorious honour of THY majesty , and of THY wondrous works .
and men shall speak of the might of THY terrible acts : and I will declare THY greatness .
they shall abundantly utter the memory of THY great Goodness , and shall sing of THY righteousness .
the Lord is gracious , and full of compassion ; slow to anger , and of great mercy .
the Lord is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works .
they shall speak of the glory of THY kingdom , and talk of THY power ;
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts , and the glorious majesty of his kingdom .
the Lord upholdeth all that fall , and raiseth up all those that be bowed down .
the eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest them their meat in due season .
Thou openest thine hand , and satisfiest the desire of every living thing .
the Lord is righteous in all his ways , and holy in all his works .
the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth .
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
the Lord preserveth all them that love him : but all the wicked will he destroy .
while I live will I praise the Lord : I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being .
put not your trust in princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help .
his breath goeth forth , he returneth to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish .
happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in the Lord his God :
which made heaven , and earth , the sea , and all that therein is : which keepeth truth for ever :
which executeth judgment for the oppressed : which giveth food to the hungry . the Lord looseth the prisoners :
the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind : the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down : the Lord loveth the righteous :
the Lord preserveth the strangers ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth Upside down .
he telleth the number of the stars ; he calleth them all by their names .
the Lord lifteth up the meek : he casteth the wicked down to the ground .
who covereth the heaven with clouds , who prepareth rain for the earth , who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains .
he giveth to the beast his food , and to the young ravens which cry .
he delighteth not in the strength of the horse : he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man .
the Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him , in those that hope in his mercy .
for he hath strengthened the bars of THY gates ; he hath blessed THY children within thee .
he maketh peace in THY borders , and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat .
he sendeth forth his commandment upon earth : his word runneth very swiftly .
he sendeth out his word , and melteth them : he causeth his wind to blow , and the waters flow .
he hath not dealt so with any nation : and as for his judgments , they have not known them . praise ye the Lord .
he hath also stablished them for ever and ever : he hath made a decree which shall not pass .
Kings of the earth , and all people ; princes , and all judges of the earth :
let them praise the name of the Lord : for his name alone is excellent ; his glory is above the earth and heaven .
he also exalteth the Horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near unto him . praise ye the Lord .
let Israel rejoice in him that made him : let the children of Zion be joyful in their King .
let them praise his name in the dance : let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp .
for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people : he will beautify the meek with salvation .
let the high praises of God be in their mouth , and a twoedged sword in their hand ;
to bind their kings with chains , and their nobles with fetters of iron ;
the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel ;
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge : but fools despise wisdom and instruction .
my son , hear the instruction of THY father , and forsake not the law of THY mother :
let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
my son , walk not thou in the way with them ; refrain THY foot from their path :
surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof .
she crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the openings of the gates : in the city she uttereth her words , saying ,
turn you at my reproof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known my words unto you .
because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no man regarded ;
but ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would none of my reproof :
then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me :
for that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the Lord :
they would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof .
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices .
for the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them .
Yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up THY voice for understanding ;
then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord , and find the knowledge of God .
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly .
when wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge is pleasant unto THY soul ;
to deliver thee from the way of the evil man , from the man that speaketh froward things ;
who rejoice to do evil , and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ;
whose ways are crooked , and they froward in their paths :
none that go unto her return again , neither take they hold of the paths of life .
that thou mayest walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths of the righteous .
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it .
my son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandments :
for length of days , and long life , and peace , shall they add to thee .
let not mercy and truth forsake thee : bind them about THY neck ; write them upon the table of thine heart :
so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
trust in the Lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .
it shall be health to THY navel , and marrow to THY bones .
honour the Lord with THY substance , and with the firstfruits of all thine increase :
so shall THY barns be filled with plenty , and THY presses shall burst out with new wine .
my son , despise not the chastening of the Lord ; neither be weary of his correction :
for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
happy is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding .
for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold .
she is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her .
length of days is in her right hand ; and in her left hand riches and honour .
the is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that retaineth her .
the Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth ; by understanding hath he established the heavens .
by his knowledge the depths are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew .
then shalt thou walk in THY way safely , and THY foot shall not stumble .
when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and THY sleep shall be sweet .
be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh .
for the Lord shall be THY confidence , and shall keep THY foot from being taken .
withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thine hand to do it .
say not unto THY neighbour , Go , and come again , and to morrow I will give ; when thou hast it by thee .
devise not evil against THY neighbour , seeing he dwelleth securely by thee .
strive not with a man without cause , if he have done thee no harm .
for the froward is abomination to the Lord : but his secret is with the righteous .
the curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the just .
for I was my father 's son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
he taught me also , and said unto me , Let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments , and live .
get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth .
Exalt her , and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honour , when thou dost embrace her .
she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee .
hear , O my son , and receive my sayings ; and the years of THY life shall be many .
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; I have led thee in right paths .
when thou goest , THY steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
take fast hold of instruction ; let her not go : keep her ; for she is THY life .
enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men .
for they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
for they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
but the path of the just is as the shining light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day .
the way of the wicked is as darkness : they know not at what they stumble .
let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep them in the midst of thine heart .
for they are life unto those that find them , and health to all their flesh .
put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
let thine eyes look right on , and let thine eyelids look straight before thee .
turn not to the right hand nor to the left : remove THY foot from evil .
for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb , and her mouth is smoother than oil :
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her ways are moveable , that thou canst not know them .
hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
remove THY way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house :
Lest thou give thine honour unto others , and THY years unto the cruel :
Lest strangers be filled with THY wealth ; and THY labours be in the house of a stranger ;
and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
drink waters out of thine own cistern , and running waters out of thine own well .
let THY fountains be dispersed abroad , and rivers of waters in the streets .
let them be only thine own , and not strangers ' with thee .
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ravished always with her love .
and why wilt thou , my son , be ravished with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
for the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord , and he pondereth all his goings .
his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins .
he shall die without instruction ; and in the greatness of his Folly he shall go astray .
my son , if thou be surety for THY friend , if thou hast stricken THY hand with a stranger ,
Thou art snared with the words of THY mouth , thou art taken with the words of THY mouth .
do this now , my son , deliver thyself , when thou art come into the hand of THY friend ; go , humble thyself , and make sure THY friend .
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
Provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest .
so shall THY poverty come as one that travelleth , and THY want as an armed man .
Frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
these six things doth the Lord hate : yea , seven are an abomination unto him :
an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief ,
my son , keep THY father 's commandment , and forsake not the law of THY mother :
when thou goest , it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keep thee ; and when thou awakest , it shall talk with thee .
for the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life :
to keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart ; neither let her take thee with her eyelids .
can a man take fire in his bosom , and his clothes not be burned ?
men do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ;
but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding : he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul .
a wound and dishonour shall he get ; and his reproach shall not be wiped away .
for jealousy is the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
he will not regard any ransom ; neither will he rest content , though thou givest many gifts .
that they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with her words .
and beheld among the simple ones , I discerned among the youths , a young man void of understanding ,
and , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot , and subtil of heart .
now is she without , now in the streets , and lieth in wait at every corner . )
so she caught him , and kissed him , and with an impudent face said unto him ,
therefore came I forth to meet thee , diligently to seek THY face , and I have found thee .
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry , with carved works , with fine linen of Egypt .
for the Goodman is not at home , he is gone a long journey :
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield , with the flattering of her lips she forced him .
he goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;
till a dart strike through his liver ; as a bird hasteth to the snare , and knoweth not that it is for his life .
Hearken unto me now therefore , O ye children , and attend to the words of my mouth .
let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths .
for she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
she standeth in the top of high places , by the way in the places of the paths .
she crieth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
unto you , O men , I call ; and my voice is to the sons of man .
hear ; for I will speak of excellent things ; and the opening of my lips shall be right things .
for my mouth shall speak truth ; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips .
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness ; there is nothing froward or perverse in them .
they are all plain to him that understandeth , and right to them that find knowledge .
for wisdom is better than rubies ; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it .
the fear of the Lord is to hate evil : pride , and arrogancy , and the evil way , and the froward mouth , do I hate .
by me princes rule , and nobles , even all the judges of the earth .
I love them that love me ; and those that seek me early shall find me .
my fruit is better than gold , yea , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
I lead in the way of righteousness , in the midst of the paths of judgment :
that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance ; and I will fill their treasures .
the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
when there were no depths , I was brought forth ; when there were no fountains abounding with water .
when he prepared the heavens , I was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the depth :
when he established the clouds above : when he strengthened the fountains of the deep :
when he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his commandment : when he appointed the foundations of the earth :
then I was by him , as one brought up with him : and I was daily his delight , rejoicing always before him ;
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth ; and my delights were with the sons of men .
now therefore hearken unto me , O ye children : for blessed are they that keep my ways .
blessed is the man that heareth me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
she hath killed her beasts ; she hath mingled her wine ; she hath also furnished her table .
she hath sent forth her maidens : she crieth upon the highest places of the city ,
Whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him ,
he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame : and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot .
Reprove not a scorner , lest he hate thee : rebuke a wise man , and he will love thee .
give instruction to a wise man , and he will be yet wiser : teach a just man , and he will increase in learning .
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom : and the knowledge of the holy is understanding .
for by me THY days shall be multiplied , and the years of THY life shall be increased .
if thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thyself : but if thou scornest , thou alone shalt bear it .
Whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : and as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him ,
the Proverbs of Solomon . a wise son maketh a glad father : but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother .
the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish : but he casteth away the substance of the wicked .
he becometh poor that dealeth with a Slack hand : but the hand of the diligent maketh rich .
he that gathereth in summer is a wise son : but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame .
Blessings are upon the head of the just : but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked .
the memory of the just is blessed : but the name of the wicked shall rot .
the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life : but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked .
in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found : but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding .
the rich man 's wealth is his strong city : the destruction of the poor is their poverty .
the labour of the righteous tendeth to life : the fruit of the wicked to sin .
he that hideth hatred with lying lips , and he that uttereth a slander , is a fool .
in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin : but he that refraineth his lips is wise .
the tongue of the just is as choice silver : the heart of the wicked is little worth .
the fear of the wicked , it shall come upon him : but the desire of the righteous shall be granted .
as vinegar to the teeth , and as smoke to the eyes , so is the sluggard to them that send him .
the fear of the Lord prolongeth days : but the years of the wicked shall be shortened .
the hope of the righteous shall be gladness : but the expectation of the wicked shall perish .
the way of the Lord is strength to the upright : but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity .
the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom : but the froward tongue shall be cut out .
the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable : but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness .
a false balance is abomination to the Lord : but a just weight is his delight .
when pride cometh , then cometh shame : but with the lowly is wisdom .
the integrity of the upright shall guide them : but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them .
the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way : but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness .
the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them : but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness .
when a wicked man dieth , his expectation shall perish : and the hope of unjust men perisheth .
when it goeth well with the righteous , the city rejoiceth : and when the wicked perish , there is shouting .
by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted : but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked .
he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour : but a man of understanding holdeth his peace .
a talebearer revealeth secrets : but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter .
where no counsel is , the people fall : but in the multitude of counsellers there is safety .
he that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it : and he that hateth suretiship is sure .
a gracious woman retaineth honour : and strong men retain riches .
the merciful man doeth good to his own soul : but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh .
the wicked worketh a deceitful work : but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward .
as righteousness tendeth to life : so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death .
they that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord : but such as are upright in their way are his delight .
though hand join in hand , the wicked shall not be unpunished : but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered .
as a jewel of gold in a swine 's snout , so is a fair woman which is without discretion .
the desire of the righteous is only good : but the expectation of the wicked is wrath .
there is that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet , but it tendeth to poverty .
the liberal soul shall be made fat : and he that watereth shall be watered also himself .
he that withholdeth corn , the people shall curse him : but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it .
he that diligently seeketh good procureth favour : but he that seeketh mischief , it shall come unto him .
he that trusteth in his riches shall fall : but the righteous shall flourish as a branch .
he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind : and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart .
the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life ; and he that winneth souls is wise .
behold , the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth : much more the wicked and the sinner .
a good man obtaineth favour of the Lord : but a man of wicked devices will he condemn .
a man shall not be established by wickedness : but the root of the righteous shall not be moved .
a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband : but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones .

the words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood : but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them .
the wicked are overthrown , and are not : but the house of the righteous shall stand .
a man shall be commended according to his wisdom : but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised .
he that is despised , and hath a servant , is better than he that honoureth himself , and lacketh bread .
a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast : but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel .
he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding .
the wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips : but the just shall come out of trouble .
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth : and the recompence of a man 's hands shall be rendered unto him .
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes : but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise .

the lip of truth shall be established for ever : but a lying tongue is but for a moment .
Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil : but to the counsellers of peace is joy .
there shall no evil happen to the just : but the wicked shall be filled with mischief .
lying lips are abomination to the Lord : but they that deal truly are his delight .
the hand of the diligent shall bear rule : but the slothful shall be under tribute .
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop : but a good word maketh it glad .
the slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting : but the substance of a diligent man is precious .
in the way of righteousness is life ; and in the pathway thereof there is no death .
a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth : but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence .
he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life : but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction .
the soul of the sluggard desireth , and hath nothing : but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat .
a righteous man hateth lying : but a wicked man is loathsome , and cometh to shame .

Righteous lips are the delight of kings ; and they love him that speaketh right .
the wrath of a king is as messengers of death : but a wise man will pacify it .
in the light of the king 's countenance is life ; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain .
how much better is it to get wisdom than gold ! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver !

better is the poor that walketh in his integrity , than he that is perverse in his lips , and is a fool .

he that wasteth his father , and chaseth away his mother , is a son that causeth shame , and bringeth reproach .
cease , my son , to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge .
the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion : whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul .
it is an honour for a man to cease from strife : but every fool will be meddling .
the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold ; therefore shall he beg in harvest , and have nothing .
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of understanding will draw it out .

divers weights , and divers measures , both of them are alike abomination to the Lord .

the king 's heart is in the hand of the Lord , as the rivers of water : he turneth it whithersoever he will .
every way of a man is right in his own eyes : but the Lord pondereth the hearts .
an high look , and a proud heart , and the plowing of the wicked , is sin .
the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness ; but of every one that is hasty only to want .
the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death .
the way of man is froward and strange : but as for the pure , his work is right .
it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman in a wide house .

a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty , and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof .
the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination : how much more , when he bringeth it with a wicked mind ?
a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches , and loving favour rather than silver and gold .

for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee ; they shall withal be fitted in THY lips .
that THY trust may be in the Lord , I have made known to thee this day , even to thee .
that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth ; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee ?
for the Lord will plead their cause , and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them .
make no friendship with an angry man ; and with a furious man thou shalt not go :
be not thou one of them that strike hands , or of them that are sureties for debts .
if thou hast nothing to pay , why should he take away THY bed from under thee ?
Seest thou a man diligent in his business ? he shall stand before kings ; he shall not stand before mean men .
when thou sittest to eat with a ruler , consider diligently what is before thee :
and put a knife to THY throat , if thou be a man given to appetite .
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not ? for riches certainly make themselves wings ; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven .
eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye , neither desire thou his dainty meats :
for as he thinketh in his heart , so is he : eat and drink , saith he to thee ; but his heart is not with thee .
speak not in the ears of a fool : for he will despise the wisdom of THY words .
withhold not correction from the child : for if thou beatest him with the rod , he shall not die .
Thou shalt beat him with the rod , and shalt deliver his soul from hell .
my son , if thine heart be wise , my heart shall rejoice , even mine .
Yea , my reins shall rejoice , when THY lips speak right things .
let not thine heart envy sinners : but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long .
for surely there is an end ; and thine expectation shall not be cut off .
hear thou , my son , and be wise , and guide thine heart in the way .
for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty : and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags .
the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice : and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him .
THY father and THY mother shall be glad , and she that bare thee shall rejoice .
they that tarry long at the wine ; they that go to seek mixed wine .
look not thou upon the wine when it is red , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright .
at the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder .
Thine eyes shall behold strange women , and thine heart shall utter perverse things .
Yea , thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea , or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast .
they have stricken me , shalt thou say , and I was not sick ; they have beaten me , and I felt it not : when shall I awake ? I will seek it yet again .
be not thou envious against evil men , neither desire to be with them .
through wisdom is an house builded ; and by understanding it is established :
for by wise counsel thou shalt make THY war : and in multitude of counsellers there is safety .
he that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person .
if thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death , and those that are ready to be slain ;
if thou sayest , behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth THY soul , doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
my son , eat thou honey , because it is good ; and the honeycomb , which is sweet to THY taste :
so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto THY soul : when thou hast found it , then there shall be a reward , and THY expectation shall not be cut off .
for a just man falleth seven times , and riseth up again : but the wicked shall fall into mischief .
rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth :
Lest the Lord see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him .
fret not thyself because of evil men , neither be thou envious at the wicked ;
for there shall be no reward to the evil man ; the candle of the wicked shall be put out .
my son , fear thou the Lord and the king : and meddle not with them that are given to change :
these things also belong to the wise . it is not good to have respect of persons in judgment .
he that saith unto the wicked , Thou are righteous ; him shall the people curse , nations shall abhor him :
but to them that rebuke him shall be delight , and a good blessing shall come upon them .
prepare THY work without , and make it fit for thyself in the field ; and afterwards build thine house .
be not a witness against THY neighbour without cause ; and deceive not with THY lips .
say not , I will do so to him as he hath done to me : I will render to the man according to his work .
I went by the field of the slothful , and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding ;
and , lo , it was all grown over with thorns , and nettles had covered the face thereof , and the stone wall thereof was broken down .
then I saw , and considered it well : I looked upon it , and received instruction .
so shall THY poverty come as one that travelleth ; and THY want as an armed man .
it is the glory of God to conceal a thing : but the honour of kings is to search out a matter .
the heaven for height , and the earth for depth , and the heart of kings is unsearchable .
take away the dross from the silver , and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer .
take away the wicked from before the king , and his throne shall be established in righteousness .
put not forth thyself in the presence of the king , and stand not in the place of great men :
for better it is that it be said unto thee , Come up hither ; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen .
go not forth hastily to strive , lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof , when THY neighbour hath put thee to shame .
debate THY cause with THY neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame , and thine infamy turn not away .
as an earring of gold , and an ornament of fine gold , so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to them that send him : for he refresheth the soul of his masters .
Hast thou found honey ? eat so much as is sufficient for thee , lest thou be filled therewith , and vomit it .
withdraw THY foot from THY neighbour 's house ; lest he be weary of thee , and so hate thee .
a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul , and a sword , and a sharp arrow .
confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth , and a foot out of joint .
as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather , and as vinegar upon nitre , so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart .
if thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink :
for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head , and the Lord shall reward thee .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman and in a wide house .
it is not good to eat much honey : so for men to search their own glory is not glory .
he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as the bird by wandering , as the swallow by flying , so the curse causeless shall not come .
a whip for the horse , a bridle for the ass , and a rod for the fool 's back .
answer a fool according to his Folly , lest he be wise in his own conceit .
the legs of the lame are not equal : so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as he that bindeth a stone in a sling , so is he that giveth honour to a fool .
as a Thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard , so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his Folly .
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit ? there is more hope of a fool than of him .
the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom ; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth .
he that passeth by , and meddleth with strife belonging not to him , is like one that taketh a dog by the ears .
as a mad man who casteth firebrands , arrows , and death ,
where no wood is , there the fire goeth out : so where there is no talebearer , the strife ceaseth .
the words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly .
when he speaketh fair , believe him not : for there are seven abominations in his heart .
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein : and he that rolleth a stone , it will return upon him .
a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it ; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin .
boast not thyself of to morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth .
let another man praise thee , and not thine own mouth ; a stranger , and not thine own lips .
a stone is heavy , and the sand weighty ; but a fool 's wrath is heavier than them both .
wrath is cruel , and anger is outrageous ; but who is able to stand before envy ?
faithful are the wounds of a friend ; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful .
as a bird that wandereth from her nest , so is a man that wandereth from his place .
ointment and perfume rejoice the heart : so doth the sweetness of a man 's friend by hearty counsel .
Thine own friend , and THY father 's friend , forsake not ; neither go into THY brother 's house in the day of THY calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
my son , be wise , and make my heart glad , that I may answer him that reproacheth me .
a prudent man foreseeth the evil , and hideth himself ; but the simple pass on , and are punished .
he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a curse to him .
iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend .
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof : so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured .
though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him .
be thou diligent to know the state of THY flocks , and look well to THY herds .
for riches are not for ever : and doth the crown endure to every generation ?
the hay appeareth , and the tender grass sheweth itself , and herbs of the mountains are gathered .
the lambs are for THY clothing , and the goats are the price of the field .
and thou shalt have goats ' milk enough for THY food , for the food of THY household , and for the maintenance for THY maidens .
for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged .
a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food .
they that forsake the law praise the wicked : but such as keep the law contend with them .
evil men understand not judgment : but they that seek the Lord understand all things .
better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son : but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father .
he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance , he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor .
he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer shall be abomination .
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way , he shall fall himself into his own pit : but the upright shall have good things in possession .
the rich man is wise in his own conceit ; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out .
when righteous men do rejoice , there is great glory : but when the wicked rise , a man is hidden .
he that covereth his sins shall not prosper : but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy .
happy is the man that feareth alway : but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief .
as a roaring lion , and a ranging bear ; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people .
the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor : but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days .
a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit ; let no man stay him .
Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved : but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once .
he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough .
a faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent .
he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him .
he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue .
Whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer .
he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife : but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat .
he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool : but whoso walketh wisely , he shall be delivered .
he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse .
he , that being often reproved hardeneth his neck , shall suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .
when the righteous are in authority , the people rejoice : but when the wicked beareth rule , the people mourn .
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father : but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance .
in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare : but the righteous doth sing and rejoice .
Scornful men bring a city into a snare : but wise men turn away wrath .
if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man , whether he rage or laugh , there is no rest .
a fool uttereth all his mind : but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards .
the king that faithfully judgeth the poor , his throne shall be established for ever .
the rod and reproof give wisdom : but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame .
correct THY son , and he shall give thee rest ; yea , he shall give delight unto THY soul .
a servant will not be corrected by words : for though he understand he will not answer .
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words ? there is more hope of a fool than of him .
he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length .
a man 's pride shall bring him low : but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit .
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul : he heareth cursing , and bewrayeth it not .
the fear of man bringeth a snare : but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe .
an unjust man is an abomination to the just : and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked .
surely I am more brutish than any man , and have not the understanding of a man .
every word of God is pure : he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him .
Lest I be full , and deny thee , and say , Who is the Lord ? or lest I be poor , and steal , and take the name of my God in vain .
there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet is not washed from their filthiness .
there is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
the grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , It is enough .
the eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young eagles shall eat it .
there be three things which are too wonderful for me , yea , four which I know not :
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
for a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he is filled with meat ;
for an odious woman when she is married ; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress .
the locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ;
a greyhound ; an he goat also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising up .
if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself , or if thou hast thought evil , lay thine hand upon THY mouth .
surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter , and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood : so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife .
what , my son ? and what , the son of my womb ? and what , the son of my vows ?
give not THY strength unto women , nor THY ways to that which destroyeth kings .
it is not for kings , O Lemuel , it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes strong drink :
Lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted .
give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish , and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts .
let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more .
open THY mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction .
the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
she is like the merchants ' ships ; she bringeth her food from afar .
she riseth also while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and a portion to her maidens .
she considereth a field , and buyeth it : with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .
she perceiveth that her merchandise is good : her candle goeth not out by night .
she layeth her hands to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff .
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
she is not afraid of the snow for her household : for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
she maketh fine linen , and selleth it ; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come .
she openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness .
she looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
favour is deceitful , and beauty is vain : but a woman that feareth the Lord , she shall be praised .
give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
the words of the preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem .
what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun ?
the sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to his place where he arose .
the wind goeth toward the south , and turneth about unto the north ; it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again according to his circuits .
all the rivers run into the sea ; yet the sea is not full ; unto the place from whence the rivers come , thither they return again .
all things are full of labour ; man cannot utter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
the thing that hath been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
there is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
and I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
that which is crooked cannot be made straight : and that which is wanting cannot be numbered .
I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
I made me pools of water , to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees :
I got me servants and maidens , and had servants born in my house ; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me :
I gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces : I gat me men singers and women singers , and the delights of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
so I was great , and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me .
then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on the labour that I had laboured to do : and , behold , all was vanity and vexation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
and I turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and Folly : for what can the man do that cometh after the king ? even that which hath been already done .
the wise man 's eyes are in his head ; but the fool walketh in darkness : and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all .
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how dieth the wise man ? as the fool .
therefore I hated life ; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me : for all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
Yea , I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun : because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured , and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun . this is also vanity .
therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun .
for what hath man of all his labour , and of the vexation of his heart , wherein he hath laboured under the sun ?
for all his days are sorrows , and his travail grief ; yea , his heart taketh not rest in the night . this is also vanity .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
to every thing there is a season , and a time to every purpose under the heaven :
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to get , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
I have seen the travail , which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it .
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of God .
I know that , whatsoever God doeth , it shall be for ever : nothing can be put to it , nor any thing taken from it : and God doeth it , that men should fear before him .
and moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity was there .
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
all go unto one place ; all are of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
so I returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive .
Yea , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
again , I considered all travail , and every right work , that for this a man is envied of his neighbour . this is also vanity and vexation of spirit .
the fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king , who will no more be admonished .
for out of prison he cometh to reign ; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor .
I considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in his stead .
there is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them : they also that come after shall not rejoice in him . surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit .
keep THY foot when thou goest to the house of God , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fools : for they consider not that they do evil .
be not rash with THY mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let THY words be few .
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business ; and a fool 's voice is known by multitude of words .
when thou vowest a vow unto God , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou hast vowed .
better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
suffer not THY mouth to cause THY flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it was an error : wherefore should God be angry at THY voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ?
moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance with increase : this is also vanity .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ?
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
as he came forth of his mother 's womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
and this also is a sore evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind ?
all his days also he eateth in darkness , and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness .
there is an evil which I have seen under the sun , and it is common among men :
all the labour of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
for what hath the wise more than the fool ? what hath the poor , that knoweth to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this is also vanity and vexation of spirit .
that which hath been is named already , and it is known that it is man : neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he .
a good name is better than precious ointment ; and the day of death than the day of one 's birth .
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
surely oppression maketh a wise man mad ; and a gift destroyeth the heart .
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof : and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
be not hasty in THY spirit to be angry : for anger resteth in the bosom of fools .
say not thou , What is the cause that the former days were better than these ? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this .
wisdom is good with an inheritance : and by it there is profit to them that see the sun .
for wisdom is a defence , and money is a defence : but the excellency of knowledge is , that wisdom giveth life to them that have it .
consider the work of God : for who can make that straight , which he hath made crooked ?
in the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider : God also hath set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
all things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness .
be not over much wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before THY time ?
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
also take no heed unto all words that are spoken ; lest thou hear THY servant curse thee :
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of Folly , even of foolishness and madness :
which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
who is as the wise man ? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom maketh his face to shine , and the boldness of his face shall be changed .
I counsel thee to keep the king 's commandment , and that in regard of the oath of God .
be not hasty to go out of his sight : stand not in an evil thing ; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him .
where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say unto him , What doest thou ?
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing : and a wise man 's heart discerneth both time and judgment .
because to every purpose there is time and judgment , therefore the misery of man is great upon him .
for he knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell him when it shall be ?
all this have I seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun : there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt .
and so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him :
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before God .
there is a vanity which is done upon the earth ; that there be just men , unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked ; again , there be wicked men , to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous : I said that this also is vanity .
when I applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth : ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes : )
for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope : for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
go THY way , eat THY bread with joy , and drink THY wine with a merry heart ; for God now accepteth THY works .
let THY garments be always white ; and let THY head lack no ointment .
whatsoever THY hand findeth to do , do it with THY might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , whither thou goest .
for man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and besieged it , and built great bulwarks against it :
now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little Folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand ; but a fool 's heart at his left .
Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not THY place ; for yielding pacifieth great offences .
there is an evil which I have seen under the sun , as an error which proceedeth from the ruler :
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh an hedge , a serpent shall bite him .
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby .
if the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
the words of a wise man 's mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness : and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them , because he knoweth not how to go to the city .
Woe to thee , O land , when THY king is a child , and THY princes eat in the morning !
blessed art thou , O land , when THY king is the son of nobles , and THY princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
by much slothfulness the building decayeth ; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through .
give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
he that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
in the morning sow THY seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun :
but if a man live many years , and rejoice in them all ; yet let him remember the days of darkness ; for they shall be many . all that cometh is vanity .
therefore remove sorrow from THY heart , and put away evil from THY flesh : for childhood and youth are vanity .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be darkened ,
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low ;
or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
then shall the dust return to the earth as it was : and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it .
and moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many Proverbs .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was upright , even words of truth .
the words of the wise are as goads , and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
and further , by these , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : fear God , and keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man .
for God shall bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good , or whether it be evil .
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth : for THY love is better than wine .
because of the savour of THY good ointments THY name is as ointment poured forth , therefore do the virgins love thee .
look not upon me , because I am black , because the sun hath looked upon me : my mother 's children were angry with me ; they made me the keeper of the vineyards ; but mine own vineyard have I not kept .
tell me , O thou whom my soul loveth , where thou feedest , where thou makest THY flock to rest at noon : for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of THY companions ?
if thou know not , O thou fairest among women , go THY way forth by the footsteps of the flock , and feed THY kids beside the shepherds ' tents .
I have compared thee , O my love , to a company of horses in Pharaoh 's chariots .
THY cheeks are comely with rows of jewels , THY neck with chains of gold .
while the king sitteth at his table , my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof .
a bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me ; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts .
my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En @-@ gedi .
behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant : also our bed is green .
I am the rose of Sharon , and the Lily of the valleys .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
he brought me to the banqueting house , and his banner over me was love .
his left hand is under my head , and his right hand doth embrace me .
I charge you , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
the voice of my beloved ! behold , he cometh leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart : behold , he standeth behind our wall , he looketh forth at the windows , shewing himself through the lattice .
my beloved spake , and said unto me , Rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
for , lo , the winter is past , the rain is over and gone ;
the flowers appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ;
the fig tree putteth forth her green figs , and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell . arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
O my dove , that art in the clefts of the rock , in the secret places of the stairs , let me see THY countenance , let me hear THY voice ; for sweet is THY voice , and THY countenance is comely .
take us the foxes , the little foxes , that spoil the vines : for our vines have tender grapes .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether .
by night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
the watchmen that go about the city found me : to whom I said , saw ye him whom my soul loveth ?
it was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my soul loveth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother 's house , and into the chamber of her that conceived me .
I charge you , O ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powders of the merchant ?
behold his bed , which is Solomon 's ; threescore valiant men are about it , of the valiant of Israel .
they all hold swords , being expert in war : every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night .
he made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , O ye daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day of the gladness of his heart .
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast doves ' eyes within THY locks : THY hair is as a flock of goats , that appear from mount Gilead .
THY teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn , which came up from the washing ; whereof every one bear twins , and none is barren among them .
THY lips are like a thread of scarlet , and THY speech is comely : THY temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within THY locks .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of Amana , from the top of Shenir and Hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
Thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my spouse ; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of THY neck .
how fair is THY love , my sister , my spouse ! how much better is THY love than wine ! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices !
THY lips , O my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under THY tongue ; and the smell of THY garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
awake , O north wind ; and come , thou south ; blow upon my garden , that the spices thereof may flow out . let my beloved come into his garden , and eat his pleasant fruits .
I have put off my coat ; how shall I put it on ? I have washed my feet ; how shall I defile them ?
my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door , and my bowels were moved for him .
I rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with myrrh , and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh , upon the handles of the lock .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my soul failed when he spake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
the watchmen that went about the city found me , they smote me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me .
I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , if ye find my beloved , that ye tell him , that I am sick of love .
what is THY beloved more than another beloved , O thou fairest among women ? what is THY beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ?
his head is as the most fine gold , his locks are bushy , and black as a raven .
his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters , washed with milk , and fitly set .
his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl : his belly is as bright Ivory overlaid with sapphires .
his mouth is most sweet : yea , he is altogether lovely . this is my beloved , and this is my friend , O daughters of Jerusalem .
Whither is THY beloved gone , O thou fairest among women ? whither is THY beloved turned aside ? that we may seek him with thee .
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
turn away thine eyes from me , for they have overcome me : THY hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead .
THY teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing , whereof every one beareth twins , and there is not one barren among them .
as a piece of a pomegranate are THY temples within THY locks .
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranates budded .
how beautiful are THY feet with shoes , O prince 's daughter ! the joints of THY thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a cunning workman .
THY navel is like a round goblet , which wanteth not liquor : THY belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies .
THY neck is as a tower of Ivory ; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon , by the gate of Bath @-@ rabbim : THY nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus .
Thine head upon thee is like Carmel , and the hair of thine head like purple ; the king is held in the galleries .
this THY stature is like to a palm tree , and THY breasts to clusters of grapes .
I said , I will go up to the palm tree , I will take hold of the boughs thereof : now also THY breasts shall be as clusters of the vine , and the smell of THY nose like apples ;
and the roof of THY mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that goeth down sweetly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field ; let us lodge in the villages .
let us get up early to the vineyards ; let us see if the vine flourish , whether the tender grape appear , and the pomegranates bud forth : there will I give thee my loves .
the mandrakes give a smell , and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits , new and old , which I have laid up for thee , O my beloved .
O that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! when I should find thee without , I would kiss thee ; yea , I should not be despised .
I would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
his left hand should be under my head , and his right hand should embrace me .
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised thee up under the apple tree : there THY mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
set me as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm : for love is strong as death ; jealousy is cruel as the grave : the coals thereof are coals of fire , which hath a most vehement flame .
many waters cannot quench love , neither can the floods drown it : if a man would give all the substance of his house for love , it would utterly be contemned .
we have a little sister , and she hath no breasts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ?
if she be a wall , we will build upon her a palace of silver : and if she be a door , we will inclose her with boards of cedar .
I am a wall , and my breasts like towers : then was I in his eyes as one that found favour .
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal @-@ hamon ; he let out the vineyard unto keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
my vineyard , which is mine , is before me : thou , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
make haste , my beloved , and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices .
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
hear , O heavens , and give ear , O earth : for the Lord hath spoken , I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me .
Ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children that are corrupters : they have forsaken the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger , they are gone away backward .
why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
your country is desolate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers devour it in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
and the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as Sodom , and we should have been like unto Gomorrah .
hear the word of the Lord , ye rulers of Sodom ; give ear unto the law of our God , ye people of Gomorrah .
when ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to tread my courts ?
bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , I cannot away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth : they are a trouble unto me ; I am weary to bear them .
and when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : yea , when ye make many prayers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it .
how is the faithful city become an harlot ! it was full of judgment ; righteousness lodged in it ; but now murderers .
THY princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
therefore saith the Lord , the Lord of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies :
and I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away THY dross , and take away all THY tin :
and I will restore THY judges as at the first , and THY counsellers as at the beginning : afterward thou shalt be called , The city of righteousness , the faithful city .
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together , and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired , and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen .
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that hath no water .
and the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it .
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
O house of Jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of the Lord .
therefore thou hast forsaken THY people the house of Jacob , because they be replenished from the east , and are soothsayers like the Philistines , and they please themselves in the children of strangers .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
and the mean man boweth down , and the great man humbleth himself : therefore forgive them not .
enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and upon all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ,
and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ,
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils : for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
and the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the honourable .
when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father , saying , Thou hast clothing , be thou our ruler , and let this ruin be under THY hand :
in that day shall he swear , saying , I will not be an healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing : make me not a ruler of the people .
for Jerusalem is ruined , and Judah is fallen : because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
the shew of their countenance doth witness against them ; and they declare their sin as Sodom , they hide it not . Woe unto their soul ! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves .
say ye to the righteous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
Woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
moreover the Lord saith , Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they go , and making a tinkling with their feet :
therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , and the Lord will discover their secret parts .
and it shall come to pass , that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink ; and instead of a girdle a rent ; and instead of well set hair baldness ; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth ; and burning instead of beauty .
THY men shall fall by the sword , and THY mighty in the war .
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man , saying , We will eat our own bread , and wear our own apparel : only let us be called by THY name , to take away our reproach .
in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in Zion , and he that remaineth in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem :
when the Lord shall have washed away the Filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
and the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a flaming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat , and for a place of refuge , and for a covert from storm and from rain .
now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard . my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that I have not done in it ? wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
and now go to ; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard : I will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eaten up ; and break down the wall thereof , and it shall be trodden down :
and I will lay it waste : it shall not be pruned , nor digged ; but there shall come up briers and thorns : I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it .
for the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for judgment , but behold oppression ; for righteousness , but behold a cry .
Woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth !
Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , till wine inflame them !
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
therefore my people are gone into captivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honourable men are famished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
therefore hell hath enlarged herself , and opened her mouth without measure : and their glory , and their multitude , and their pomp , and he that rejoiceth , shall descend into it .
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the mighty man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled :
but the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness .
then shall the lambs feed after their manner , and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat .
Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity , and sin as it were with a cart rope :
that say , Let him make speed , and hasten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
Woe unto them that call evil good , and good evil ; that put darkness for light , and light for darkness ; that put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter !
Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent , their horses ' hoofs shall be counted like Flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind :
their roaring shall be like a lion , they shall roar like young lions : yea , they shall roar , and lay hold of the prey , and shall carry it away safe , and none shall deliver it .
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .
in the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up , and his train filled the temple .
above it stood the seraphims : each one had six wings ; with twain he covered his face , and with twain he covered his feet , and with twain he did fly .
and one cried unto another , and said , Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
and he laid it upon my mouth , and said , Lo , this hath touched THY lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away , and THY sin purged .
make the heart of this people fat , and make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and convert , and be healed .
and the Lord have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
and it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham , the son of Uzziah , king of Judah , that Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is confederate with Ephraim . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
then said the Lord unto Isaiah , Go forth now to meet Ahaz , thou , and Shear @-@ jashub THY son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field ;
and say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
let us go up against Judah , and vex it , and let us make a breach therein for us , and set a king in the midst of it , even the son of Tabeal :
for the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is Rezin ; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken , that it be not a people .
and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . if ye will not believe , surely ye shall not be established .
therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign ; behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Immanuel .
butter and honey shall he eat , that he may know to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings .
the Lord shall bring upon thee , and upon THY people , and upon THY father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
in the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired , namely , by them beyond the river , by the king of Assyria , the head , and the hair of the feet : and it shall also consume the beard .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a young cow , and two sheep ;
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria .
take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
for the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
say ye not , A confederacy , to all them to whom this people shall say , A confederacy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be afraid .
Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
and he shall be for a sanctuary ; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and many among them shall stumble , and fall , and be broken , and be snared , and be taken .
and I will wait upon the Lord , that hideth his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
and they shall pass through it , hardly bestead and hungry : and it shall come to pass , that when they shall be hungry , they shall fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and look upward .
and they shall look unto the earth ; and behold trouble and darkness , dimness of anguish ; and they shall be driven to darkness .
the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light : they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hath the light shined .
Thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , as in the day of Midian .
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise , and garments rolled in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Wonderful , Counseller , The mighty God , The everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them , neither do they seek the Lord of hosts .
the ancient and honourable , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
for the leaders of this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
for wickedness burneth as the fire : it shall devour the briers and thorns , and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spare his brother .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees , and that write grievousness which they have prescribed ;
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
Howbeit he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols , and whose Graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria ;
shall I not , as I have done unto Samaria and her idols , so do to Jerusalem and her idols ?
shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith ? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it ? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ;
and shall consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body : and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth .
and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few , that a child may write them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the remnant of Israel , and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob , shall no more again stay upon him that smote them ; but shall stay upon the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
for though THY people Israel be as the sand of the sea , yet a remnant of them shall return : the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation shall cease , and mine anger in their destruction .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off THY shoulder , and his yoke from off THY neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing .
he is come to Aiath , he is passed to Migron ; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages :
they are gone over the passage : they have taken up their lodging at Geba ; Ramah is afraid ; Gibeah of Saul is fled .
as yet shall he remain at Nob that day : he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
behold , the Lord , the Lord of hosts , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down , and the haughty shall be humbled .
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse , and a Branch shall grow out of his roots :
and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord ;
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears :
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth , and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked .
the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb , and the Leopard shall lie down with the kid ; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together ; and a little child shall lead them .
and the cow and the bear shall feed ; their young ones shall lie down together : and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den .
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea .
and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the Gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel , and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth .
the envy also of Ephraim shall depart , and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off : Ephraim shall not envy Judah , and Judah shall not vex Ephraim .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab ; and the children of Ammon shall obey them .
behold , God is my salvation ; I will trust , and not be afraid : for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song ; he also is become my salvation .
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation .
and in that day shall ye say , Praise the Lord , call upon his name , declare his doings among the people , make mention that his name is exalted .
sing unto the Lord ; for he hath done excellent things : this is known in all the earth .
the burden of Babylon , which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see .
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain , exalt the voice unto them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
I have commanded my sanctified ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my highness .
the noise of a multitude in the mountains , like as of a great people ; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together : the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle .
they come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the Lord , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
and they shall be afraid : pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them ; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth : they shall be amazed one at another ; their faces shall be as flames .
behold , the day of the Lord cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light : the sun shall be darkened in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to shine .
and I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity ; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease , and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible .
I will make a man more precious than fine gold ; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir .
therefore I will shake the heavens , and the earth shall remove out of her place , in the wrath of the Lord of hosts , and in the day of his fierce anger .
and it shall be as the chased roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
every one that is found shall be thrust through ; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword .
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
behold , I will stir up the Medes against them , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; their eye shall not spare children .
it shall never be inhabited , neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation : neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there ; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there .
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there .
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
for the Lord will have mercy on Jacob , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land : and the strangers shall be joined with them , and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from THY sorrow , and from THY fear , and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve ,
the Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked , and the sceptre of the rulers .
he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke , he that ruled the nations in anger , is persecuted , and none hindereth .
the whole earth is at rest , and is quiet : they break forth into singing .
Yea , the fir trees rejoice at thee , and the cedars of Lebanon , saying , Since thou art laid down , no Feller is come up against us .
THY pomp is brought down to the grave , and the noise of THY viols : the worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee .
how art thou fallen from heaven , O Lucifer , son of the morning ! how art thou cut down to the ground , which didst weaken the nations !
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; I will be like the most High .
yet thou shalt be brought down to hell , to the sides of the pit .
all the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in glory , every one in his own house .
Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed THY land , and slain THY people : the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned .
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
I will also make it a possession for the bittern , and pools of water : and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction , saith the Lord of hosts .
the Lord of hosts hath sworn , saying , surely as I have thought , so shall it come to pass ; and as I have purposed , so shall it stand :
that I will break the Assyrian in my land , and upon my mountains tread him under foot : then shall his yoke depart from off them , and his burden depart from off their shoulders .
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth : and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations .
for the Lord of hosts hath purposed , and who shall disannul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ?
rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent 's root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill THY root with famine , and he shall slay THY remnant .
the burden of Moab . because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
he is gone up to Bajith , and to Dibon , the high places , to weep : Moab shall howl over Nebo , and over Medeba : on all their heads shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth : on the tops of their houses , and in their streets , every one shall howl , weeping abundantly .
and Heshbon shall cry , and Elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
my heart shall cry out for Moab ; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar , an heifer of three years old : for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up ; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
for the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate : for the hay is withered away , the grass faileth , there is no green thing .
therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the Brook of the willows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab ; the howling thereof unto Eglaim , and the howling thereof unto Beer @-@ elim .
for the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood : for I will bring more upon Dimon , lions upon him that escapeth of Moab , and upon the remnant of the land .
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of Zion .
for it shall be , that , as a wandering bird cast out of the nest , so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon .
and in mercy shall the throne be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David , judging , and seeking judgment , and hasting righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Moab ; he is very proud : even of his haughtiness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah : I will water thee with my tears , O Heshbon , and Elealeh : for the shouting for THY summer fruits and for THY harvest is fallen .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
this is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning Moab since that time .
the burden of Damascus . behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it shall be a ruinous heap .
the cities of Aroer are forsaken : they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the fortress also shall cease from Ephraim , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remnant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , saith the Lord of hosts .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn , and reapeth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim .
at that day shall a man look to his Maker , and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel .
and he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough , and an uppermost branch , which they left because of the children of Israel : and there shall be desolation .
in the day shalt thou make THY plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make THY seed to flourish : but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
and behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains ; and when he bloweth a trumpet , hear ye .
for afore the harvest , when the bud is perfect , and the sour grape is ripening in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and take away and cut down the branches .
they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains , and to the beasts of the earth : and the fowls shall summer upon them , and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them .
the burden of Egypt . behold , the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof ; and I will destroy the counsel thereof : and they shall seek to the idols , and to the charmers , and to them that have familiar spirits , and to the wizards .
and the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , saith the Lord , the Lord of hosts .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be wasted and dried up .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up : the reeds and flags shall wither .
the paper reeds by the brooks , by the mouth of the brooks , and every thing sown by the brooks , shall wither , be driven away , and be no more .
the fishers also shall mourn , and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish .
moreover they that work in fine flax , and they that weave networks , shall be confounded .
and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof , all that make sluices and ponds for fish .
where are they ? where are THY wise men ? and let them tell thee now , and let them know what the Lord of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt .
the princes of Zoan are become fools , the princes of Noph are deceived ; they have also seduced Egypt , even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof .
the Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof : and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit .
in that day shall Egypt be like unto women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord of hosts , which he shaketh over it .
and the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
in that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord .
and the Lord shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the Lord , and perform it .
and the Lord shall smite Egypt : he shall smite and heal it : and they shall return even to the Lord , and he shall be intreated of them , and shall heal them .
in that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria , and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians .
so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners , and the Ethiopians captives , young and old , naked and barefoot , even with their buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the desert of the sea . as whirlwinds in the south pass through ; so it cometh from the desert , from a terrible land .
therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
my heart panted , fearfulness affrighted me : the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me .
for thus hath the Lord said unto me , Go , set a watchman , let him declare what he seeth .
and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen , a chariot of asses , and a chariot of camels ; and he hearkened diligently with much heed :
and he cried , A lion : my lord , I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime , and I am set in my ward whole nights :
O my threshing , and the corn of my floor : that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared unto you .
the burden upon Arabia . in the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge , O ye travelling companies of Dedanim .
the inhabitants of the land of TEMA brought water to him that was thirsty , they prevented with their bread him that fled .
for they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
for thus hath the Lord said unto me , Within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail :
and the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , shall be diminished : for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it .
all THY rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
and it shall come to pass , that THY choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and he discovered the covering of Judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest .
Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof , neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago .
and in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth :
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock ?
behold , the Lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity , and will surely cover thee .
he will surely violently turn and Toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariots of THY glory shall be the shame of THY lord 's house .
and I will drive thee from THY station , and from THY state shall he pull thee down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah :
and I will clothe him with THY robe , and strengthen him with THY girdle , and I will commit THY government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father 's house .
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups , even to all the vessels of flagons .
the burden of Tyre . Howl , ye ships of Tarshish ; for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in : from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them .
be still , ye inhabitants of the isle ; thou whom the merchants of Zidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
and by great waters the seed of Sihor , the harvest of the river , is her revenue ; and she is a Mart of nations .
be thou ashamed , O Zidon : for the sea hath spoken , even the strength of the sea , saying , I travail not , nor bring forth children , neither do I nourish up young men , nor bring up virgins .
as at the report concerning Egypt , so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre .
is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days ? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn .
the Lord of hosts hath purposed it , to stain the pride of all glory , and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth .
he stretched out his hand over the sea , he shook the kingdoms : the Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong holds thereof .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king : after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot .
and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years , that the Lord will visit Tyre , and she shall turn to her hire , and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth .
behold , the Lord maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it Upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
the land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled : for the Lord hath spoken this word .
the earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , changed the ordinance , broken the everlasting Covenant .
therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
the mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
they shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
the city of confusion is broken down : every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
there is a crying for wine in the streets ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
in the city is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
they shall lift up their voice , they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord , they shall cry aloud from the sea .
Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires , even the name of the Lord God of Israel in the isles of the sea .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , O inhabitant of the earth .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth do shake .
the earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly .
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
O Lord , thou art my God ; I will exalt thee , I will praise THY name ; for thou hast done wonderful things ; THY counsels of old are faithfulness and truth .
for thou hast made of a city an heap ; of a defenced city a ruin : a palace of strangers to be no city ; it shall never be built .
Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low .
and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
he will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the Lord hath spoken it .
and it shall be said in that day , Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the Lord ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
and the fortress of the high Fort of THY walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
in that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah ; We have a strong city ; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks .
open ye the gates , that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in .
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
for he bringeth down them that dwell on high ; the lofty city , he layeth it low ; he layeth it low , even to the ground ; he bringeth it even to the dust .
the foot shall tread it down , even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy .
the way of the just is uprightness : thou , most upright , dost weigh the path of the just .
Yea , in the way of THY judgments , O Lord , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to THY name , and to the remembrance of thee .
with my soul have I desired thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me will I seek thee early : for when THY judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the Lord .
Lord , when THY hand is lifted up , they will not see : but they shall see , and be ashamed for their envy at the people ; yea , the fire of thine enemies shall devour them .
O Lord our God , other lords beside thee have had dominion over us : but by thee only will we make mention of THY name .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
Thou hast increased the nation , O Lord , thou hast increased the nation : thou art glorified : thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth .
Lord , in trouble have they visited thee , they poured out a prayer when THY chastening was upon them .
like as a woman with child , that draweth near the time of her delivery , is in pain , and crieth out in her pangs ; so have we been in THY sight , O Lord .
we have been with child , we have been in pain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
come , my people , enter thou into THY chambers , and shut THY doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
for , behold , the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity : the earth also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her slain .
in that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea .
I the Lord do keep it ; I will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , I will keep it night and day .
fury is not in me : who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle ? I would go through them , I would burn them together .
or let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me .
he shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root : Israel shall blossom and bud , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
Hath he smitten him , as he smote those that smote him ? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him ?
in measure , when it shooteth forth , thou wilt debate with it : he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind .
yet the defenced city shall be desolate , and the habitation forsaken , and left like a wilderness : there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume the branches thereof .
when the boughs thereof are withered , they shall be broken off : the women come , and set them on fire : for it is a people of no understanding : therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them , and he that formed them will shew them no favour .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , O ye children of Israel .
Woe to the crown of pride , to the drunkards of Ephraim , whose glorious beauty is a fading flower , which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine !
behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
the crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , shall be trodden under feet :
in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people ,
and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness , so that there is no place clean .
to whom he said , This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest ; and this is the refreshing : yet they would not hear .
therefore thus saith the Lord God , behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believeth shall not make haste .
judgment also will I lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet : and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters shall overflow the hiding place .
and your Covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
for the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
Doth the plowman plow all day to sow ? doth he open and break the clods of his ground ?
when he hath made plain the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the fitches , and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie in their place ?
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
bread corn is bruised ; because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
yet I will distress Ariel , and there shall be heaviness and sorrow : and it shall be unto me as Ariel .
and I will camp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with a mount , and I will raise forts against thee .
moreover the multitude of THY strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts with Thunder , and with earthquake , and great noise , with storm and tempest , and the flame of devouring fire .
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all that fight against her and her munition , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
stay yourselves , and wonder ; cry ye out , and cry : they are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep , and hath closed your eyes : the prophets and your rulers , the seers hath he covered .
Wherefore the Lord said , Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth , and with their lips do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men :
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
the meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquity are cut off :
that make a man an offender for a word , and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate , and turn aside the just for a thing of nought .
therefore thus saith the Lord , who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob , Jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmured shall learn doctrine .
that walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked at my mouth ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us .
Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel , Because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and stay thereon :
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant .
for thus saith the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel ; In returning and rest shall ye be saved ; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength : and ye would not .
but ye said , No ; for we will flee upon horses ; therefore shall ye flee : and , We will ride upon the swift ; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift .
one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee : till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain , and as an ensign on an hill .
for the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of THY cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and though the Lord give you the bread of adversity , and the water of affliction , yet shall not THY teachers be removed into a corner any more , but thine eyes shall see THY teachers :
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
Ye shall defile also the covering of THY Graven images of silver , and the ornament of THY molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
then shall he give the rain of THY seed , that thou shalt sow the ground withal ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous : in that day shall THY cattle feed in large pastures .
the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
behold , the name of the Lord cometh from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire :
and his breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
Ye shall have a song , as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord , to the mighty One of Israel .
and the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard , and shall shew the lighting down of his arm , with the indignation of his anger , and with the flame of a devouring fire , with scattering , and tempest , and hailstones .
for through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down , which smote with a rod .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the Lord shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on horses , and trust in chariots , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are very strong ; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel , neither seek the Lord !
yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the Lord shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
as birds flying , so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem ; defending also he will deliver it ; and passing over he will preserve it .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
the vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
the instruments also of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
many days and years shall ye be troubled , ye careless women : for the vintage shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
Tremble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye careless ones : strip you , and make you bare , and gird sackcloth upon your loins .
they shall lament for the teats , for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
and the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever .
and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwellings , and in quiet resting places ;
when it shall hail , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass .
O Lord , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou their arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
at the noise of the tumult the people fled ; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered .
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller : as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them .
the Lord is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness .
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of THY times , and strength of salvation : the fear of the Lord is his treasure .
the highways lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : he hath broken the Covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth no man .
the earth mourneth and languisheth : Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down : Sharon is like a wilderness ; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits .
Ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath , as fire , shall devour you .
and the people shall be as the burnings of lime : as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire .
hear , ye that are far off , what I have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
he that walketh righteously , and speaketh uprightly ; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions , that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes , that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood , and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil ;
he shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall behold the land that is very far off .
Thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive ; of a stammering tongue , that thou canst not understand .
for the Lord is our judge , the Lord is our lawgiver , the Lord is our king ; he will save us .
THY tacklings are loosed ; they could not well strengthen their mast , they could not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hearken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations , and his fury upon all their armies : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their slain also shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up out of their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved , and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll : and all their host shall fall down , as the leaf falleth off from the vine , and as a falling fig from the fig tree .
and the unicorns shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls ; and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness .
for it is the day of the Lord 's vengeance , and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion .
and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch , and the dust thereof into brimstone , and the land thereof shall become burning pitch .
it shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptiness .
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there , and all her princes shall be nothing .
and thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
there shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and Hatch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vultures also be gathered , every one with her Mate .
and he hath cast the lot for them , and his hand hath divided it unto them by line : they shall possess it for ever , from generation to generation shall they dwell therein .
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
it shall blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing : the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it , the excellency of Carmel and Sharon , they shall see the glory of the Lord , and the excellency of our God .
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
and the parched ground shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with reeds and rushes .
no lion shall be there , nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon , it shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
and the ransomed of the Lord shall return , and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads : they shall obtain joy and gladness , and sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah , and took them .
and the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army . and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller 's field .
then came forth unto him Eliakim , Hilkiah 's son , which was over the house , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , Asaph 's son , the recorder .
I say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
Lo , thou trustest in the staff of this broken Reed , on Egypt ; whereon if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and Pierce it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him .
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on THY part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put THY trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
then Rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , Hear ye the words of the great king , the king of Assyria .
thus saith the king , Let not Hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you .
neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying , The Lord will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
beware lest Hezekiah persuade you , saying , The Lord will deliver us . Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
then came Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , that was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah , the son of Asaph , the recorder , to Hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of Rabshakeh .
and it came to pass , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the Lord .
and he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz .
and they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
so the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
so Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
and he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , He is come forth to make war with thee . and when he heard it , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not THY God , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly ; and shalt thou be delivered ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed , as Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden which were in Telassar ?
where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arphad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ?
and Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
O Lord of hosts , God of Israel , that dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
Incline thine ear , O Lord , and hear ; open thine eyes , O Lord , and see : and hear all the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O Lord our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord , even thou only .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted THY voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have digged , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places .
Hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
but I know THY abode , and THY going out , and THY coming in , and THY rage against me .
because THY rage against me , and THY tumult , is come up into mine ears , therefore will I put my hook in THY nose , and my bridle in THY lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this .
therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria , He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields , nor cast a bank against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the Lord .
then the angel of the Lord went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Armenia : and Esar @-@ haddon his son reigned in his stead .
then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall , and prayed unto the Lord ,
and said , Remember now , O Lord , I beseech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in THY sight . and Hezekiah wept sore .
go , and say to Hezekiah , Thus saith the Lord , the God of David THY father , I have heard THY prayer , I have seen THY tears : behold , I will add unto THY days fifteen years .
and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria : and I will defend this city .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken ;
behold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz , ten degrees backward . so the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness :
I said in the cutting off of my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave : I am deprived of the residue of my years .
I said , I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living : I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
mine age is departed , and is removed from me as a shepherd 's tent : I have cut off like a weaver my life : he will cut me off with pining sickness : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
I reckoned till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bones : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
like a crane or a swallow , so did I chatter : I did mourn as a dove : mine eyes fail with looking upward : O Lord , I am oppressed ; undertake for me .
what shall I say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it : I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
O Lord , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit : so wilt thou recover me , and make me to live .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind THY back .
for the grave cannot praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit cannot hope for THY truth .
the living , the living , he shall praise thee , as I do this day : the father to the children shall make known THY truth .
the Lord was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord .
for Isaiah had said , Let them take a lump of figs , and lay it for a plaister upon the boil , and he shall recover .
at that time Merodach @-@ baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah : for he had heard that he had been sick , and was recovered .
then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah , and said unto him , What said these men ? and from whence came they unto thee ? and Hezekiah said , They are come from a far country unto me , even from Babylon .
then said he , What have they seen in thine house ? and Hezekiah answered , All that is in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which THY fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the Lord .
and of THY sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned : for she hath received of the Lord 's hand double for all her sins .
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain :
and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together : for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth : because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it : surely the people is grass .
behold , the Lord God will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and meted out heaven with the span , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ?
with whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance : behold , he taketh up the isles as a very little thing .
all nations before him are as nothing ; and they are counted to him less than nothing , and vanity .
to whom then will ye liken God ? or what likeness will ye compare unto him ?
the workman melteth a Graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold , and casteth silver chains .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a Graven image , that shall not be moved .
have ye not known ? have ye not heard ? hath it not been told you from the beginning ? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in :
that bringeth the princes to nothing ; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
why sayest thou , O Jacob , and speakest , O Israel , My way is hid from the Lord , and my judgment is passed over from my God ?
Hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the Lord , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
he giveth power to the faint ; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength .
even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall :
but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eagles ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
keep silence before me , O islands ; and let the people renew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment .
he pursued them , and passed safely ; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
who hath wrought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? I the Lord , the first , and with the last ; I am he .
the isles saw it , and feared ; the ends of the earth were afraid , drew near , and came .
so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith , and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil , saying , It is ready for the sodering : and he fastened it with nails , that it should not be moved .
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , Thou art my servant ; I have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dismayed ; for I am THY God : I will strengthen thee ; yea , I will help thee ; yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
for I the Lord THY God will hold THY right hand , saying unto thee , Fear not ; I will help thee .
behold , I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth : thou shalt thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as chaff .
Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
when the poor and needy seek water , and there is none , and their tongue faileth for thirst , I the Lord will hear them , I the God of Israel will not forsake them .
I will open rivers in high places , and fountains in the midst of the valleys : I will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
I will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the shittah tree , and the myrtle , and the oil tree ; I will set in the desert the fir tree , and the pine , and the box tree together :
that they may see , and know , and consider , and understand together , that the hand of the Lord hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it .
let them bring them forth , and shew us what shall happen : let them shew the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come .
Shew the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods : yea , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and behold it together .
behold , ye are of nothing , and your work of nought : an abomination is he that chooseth you .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the Potter treadeth clay .
who hath declared from the beginning , that we may know ? and beforetime , that we may say , He is righteous ? yea , there is none that sheweth , yea , there is none that declareth , yea , there is none that heareth your words .
the first shall say to Zion , behold , behold them : and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings .
for I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
behold my servant , whom I uphold ; mine elect , in whom my soul delighteth ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles .
he shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause his voice to be heard in the street .
a bruised Reed shall he not break , and the smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
he shall not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isles shall wait for his law .
thus saith God the Lord , he that created the heavens , and stretched them out ; he that spread forth the earth , and that which cometh out of it ; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein :
I the Lord have called thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a Covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles ;
to open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house .
I am the Lord : that is my name : and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to Graven images .
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the Lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
I have long time holden my peace ; I have been still , and refrained myself : now will I cry like a travailing woman ; I will destroy and devour at once .
I will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
they shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in Graven images , that say to the molten images , Ye are our gods .
who is blind , but my servant ? or deaf , as my messenger that I sent ? who is blind as he that is perfect , and blind as the Lord 's servant ?
the Lord is well pleased for his righteousness ' sake ; he will magnify the law , and make it honourable .
who among you will give ear to this ? who will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the robbers ? did not the Lord , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger , and the strength of battle : and it hath set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
but now thus saith the Lord that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fear not : for I have redeemed thee , I have called thee by THY name ; thou art mine .
when thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not overflow thee : when thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burned ; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .
for I am the Lord THY God , the Holy One of Israel , THY Saviour : I gave Egypt for THY ransom , Ethiopia and Seba for thee .
since thou wast precious in my sight , thou hast been honourable , and I have loved thee : therefore will I give men for thee , and people for THY life .
fear not : for I am with thee : I will bring THY seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
I will say to the north , Give up ; and to the south , keep not back : bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ;
even every one that is called by my name : for I have created him for my glory , I have formed him ; yea , I have made him .
I have declared , and have saved , and I have shewed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , saith the Lord , that I am God .
Yea , before the day was I am he ; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand : I will work , and who shall let it ?
thus saith the Lord , your redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; For your sake I have sent to Babylon , and have brought down all their nobles , and the Chaldeans , whose cry is in the ships .
behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the beast of the field shall honour me , the dragons and the owls : because I give waters in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of THY burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with THY sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of THY sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with THY sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
I , even I , am he that blotteth out THY transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember THY sins .
thus saith the Lord that made thee , and formed thee from the womb , which will help thee ; Fear not , O Jacob , my servant ; and thou , Jesurun , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon THY seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring :
and they shall spring up as among the grass , as willows by the water courses .
one shall say , I am the Lord 's ; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob ; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord , and surname himself by the name of Israel .
thus saith the Lord the King of Israel , and his redeemer the Lord of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God .
who hath formed a god , or molten a Graven image that is profitable for nothing ?
behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the workmen , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
the Smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals , and fashioneth it with hammers , and worketh it with the strength of his arms : yea , he is hungry , and his strength faileth : he drinketh no water , and is faint .
he heweth him down cedars , and taketh the Cypress and the oak , which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest : he planteth an ash , and the rain doth nourish it .
and the residue thereof he maketh a god , even his Graven image : he falleth down unto it , and worshippeth it , and prayeth unto it , and saith , Deliver me ; for thou art my god .
they have not known nor understood : for he hath shut their eyes , that they cannot see ; and their hearts , that they cannot understand .
he feedeth on ashes : a deceived heart hath turned him aside , that he cannot deliver his soul , nor say , Is there not a lie in my right hand ?
remember these , O Jacob and Israel ; for thou art my servant : I have formed thee ; thou art my servant : O Israel , thou shalt not be forgotten of me .
I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , THY transgressions , and , as a cloud , THY sins : return unto me ; for I have redeemed thee .
I will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight : I will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron :
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the Lord , which call thee by THY name , am the God of Israel .
for Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel mine elect , I have even called thee by THY name : I have surnamed thee , though thou hast not known me .
I am the Lord , and there is none else , there is no God beside me : I girded thee , though thou hast not known me :
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none beside me . I am the Lord , and there is none else .
I form the light , and create darkness : I make peace , and create evil : I the Lord do all these things .
thus saith the Lord , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker , Ask me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
I have made the earth , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
they shall be ashamed , and also confounded , all of them : they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
assemble yourselves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their Graven image , and pray unto a god that cannot save .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
surely , shall one say , in the Lord have I righteousness and strength : even to him shall men come ; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
Hearken unto me , O house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , which are borne by me from the belly , which are carried from the womb :
and even to your old age I am he ; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you : I have made , and I will bear ; even I will carry , and will deliver you .
they lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
they bear him upon the shoulder , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he standeth ; from his place shall he not remove : yea , one shall cry unto him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ,
declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , My counsel shall stand , and I will do all my pleasure :
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth my counsel from a far country : yea , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed it , I will also do it .
I bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not tarry : and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory .
come down , and sit in the dust , O virgin daughter of Babylon , sit on the ground : there is no throne , O daughter of the Chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate .
THY nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , THY shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and I will not meet thee as a man .
I was wroth with my people , I have polluted mine inheritance , and given them into thine hand : thou didst shew them no mercy ; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid THY yoke .
and thou saidst , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these things to THY heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
for thou hast trusted in THY wickedness : thou hast said , None seeth me . THY wisdom and THY knowledge , it hath perverted thee ; and thou hast said in thine heart , I am , and none else beside me .
stand now with thine enchantments , and with the multitude of THY sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from THY youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail .
Thou art wearied in the multitude of THY counsels . let now the astrologers , the stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured , even THY merchants , from THY youth : they shall wander every one to his quarter ; none shall save thee .
hear ye this , O house of Jacob , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Judah , which swear by the name of the Lord , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness .
for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the God of Israel ; The Lord of hosts is his name .
I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and I shewed them ; I did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
because I knew that thou art obstinate , and THY neck is an iron sinew , and THY brow brass ;
I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I shewed it thee : lest thou shouldest say , Mine idol hath done them , and my Graven image , and my molten image , hath commanded them .
Thou hast heard , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ? I have shewed thee new things from this time , even hidden things , and thou didst not know them .
they are created now , and not from the beginning ; even before the day when thou heardest them not ; lest thou shouldest say , behold , I knew them .
Yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened : for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
for my name 's sake will I defer mine anger , and for my praise will I refrain for thee , that I cut thee not off .
behold , I have refined thee , but not with silver ; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and I will not give my glory unto another .
mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spanned the heavens : when I call unto them , they stand up together .
all ye , assemble yourselves , and hear ; which among them hath declared these things ? the Lord hath loved him : he will do his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yea , I have called him : I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
come ye near unto me , hear ye this ; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I : and now the Lord God , and his Spirit , hath sent me .
thus saith the Lord , THY Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; I am the Lord THY God which teacheth thee to profit , which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go .
O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments ! then had THY peace been as a river , and THY righteousness as the waves of the sea :
THY seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of THY bowels like the gravel thereof ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he clave the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
listen , O isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; The Lord hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished Shaft ; in his quiver hath he hid me ;
that thou mayest say to the prisoners , Go forth ; to them that are in darkness , Shew yourselves . they shall feed in the ways , and their pastures shall be in all high places .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
and I will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be exalted .
behold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim .
sing , O heavens ; and be joyful , O earth ; and break forth into singing , O mountains : for the Lord hath comforted his people , and will have mercy upon his afflicted .
behold , I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands ; THY walls are continually before me .
THY children shall make haste ; THY destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee .
for THY waste and THY desolate places , and the land of THY destruction , shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants , and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away .
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , The place is too strait for me : give place to me that I may dwell .
thus saith the Lord God , behold , I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles , and set up my standard to the people : and they shall bring THY sons in their arms , and THY daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders .
and kings shall be THY nursing fathers , and their queens THY nursing mothers : they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth , and lick up the dust of THY feet ; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord : for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me .
shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captive delivered ?
but thus saith the Lord , Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee , and I will save THY children .
thus saith the Lord , Where is the bill of your mother 's divorcement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves , and for your transgressions is your mother put away .
the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
the Lord God hath opened mine ear , and I was not rebellious , neither turned away back .
I gave my back to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair : I hid not my face from shame and spitting .
for the Lord God will help me ; therefore shall I not be confounded : therefore have I set my face like a Flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
he is near that justifieth me ; who will contend with me ? let us stand together : who is mine adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord God will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you that feareth the Lord , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the Lord , and stay upon his God .
Hearken to me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the Lord : look unto the rock whence ye are hewn , and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged .
look unto Abraham your father , and unto Sarah that bare you : for I called him alone , and blessed him , and increased him .
for the Lord shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the Lord ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , Thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
Hearken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the isles shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
Hearken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the reproach of men , neither be ye afraid of their revilings .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
art thou not it which hath dried the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over ?
therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return , and come with singing unto Zion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
I , even I , am he that comforteth you : who art thou , that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be made as grass ;
the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed , and that he should not die in the pit , nor that his bread should fail .
awake , awake , stand up , O Jerusalem , which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury ; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling , and wrung them out .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? desolation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
THY sons have fainted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as a wild bull in a net : they are full of the fury of the Lord , the rebuke of THY God .
thus saith THY Lord the Lord , and THY God that pleadeth the cause of his people , behold , I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling , even the dregs of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
but I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee ; which have said to THY soul , bow down , that we may go over : and thou hast laid THY body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over .
awake , awake ; put on THY strength , O Zion ; put on THY beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean .
shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of THY neck , O captive daughter of Zion .
for thus saith the Lord , Ye have sold yourselves for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money .
therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak : behold , it is I.
THY watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the Lord shall bring again Zion .
break forth into joy , sing together , ye waste places of Jerusalem : for the Lord hath comforted his people , he hath redeemed Jerusalem .
the Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
depart ye , depart ye , go ye out from thence , touch no unclean thing ; go ye out of the midst of her ; be ye clean , that bear the vessels of the Lord .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the Lord will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward .
as many were astonied at thee ; his visage was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men :
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
who hath believed our report ? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ?
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground : he hath no form nor comeliness ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he is despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was despised , and we esteemed him not .
surely he hath borne our griefs , and carried our sorrows : yet we did esteem him stricken , smitten of God , and afflicted .
all we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all .
he was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
and he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
he shall see of the travail of his soul , and shall be satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many ; for he shall bear their iniquities .
enlarge the place of THY tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations : spare not , lengthen THY cords , and strengthen THY stakes ;
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and THY seed shall inherit the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of THY youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of THY widowhood any more .
for THY Maker is thine husband ; the Lord of hosts is his name ; and THY Redeemer the Holy One of Israel ; The God of the whole earth shall he be called .
in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee , saith the Lord THY Redeemer .
for this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed , saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee .
O thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , I will lay THY stones with fair colours , and lay THY foundations with sapphires .
and I will make THY windows of agates , and THY gates of carbuncles , and all THY borders of pleasant stones .
and all THY children shall be taught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of THY children .
in righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by me : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for THY sake .
behold , I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire , and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the waster to destroy .
Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters , and he that hath no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not ? hearken diligently unto me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord THY God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
seek ye the Lord while he may be found , call ye upon him while he is near :
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the Lord , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
for as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it .
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
instead of the Thorn shall come up the fir tree , and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree : and it shall be to the Lord for a name , for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off .
blessed is the man that doeth this , and the son of man that layeth hold on it ; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it , and keepeth his hand from doing any evil .
neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the Lord , speak , saying , The Lord hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the eunuch say , behold , I am a dry tree .
for thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and take hold of my Covenant ;
even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people .
the Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith , Yet will I gather others to him , beside those that are gathered unto him .
his watchmen are blind : they are all ignorant , they are all dumb dogs , they cannot bark ; sleeping , lying down , loving to slumber .
Yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that cannot understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
the righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart : and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come .
he shall enter into peace : they shall rest in their beds , each one walking in his uprightness .
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set THY bed : even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
and thou wentest to the king with ointment , and didst increase THY perfumes , and didst send THY messengers far off , and didst debase thyself even unto hell .
Thou art wearied in the greatness of THY way ; yet saidst thou not , There is no hope : thou hast found the life of thine hand ; therefore thou wast not grieved .
and shall say , cast ye up , cast ye up , prepare the way , take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people .
for thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , whose name is Holy ; I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones .
for I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always wroth : for the spirit should fail before me , and the souls which I have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth , and smote him : I hid me , and was wroth , and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart .
I create the fruit of the lips ; Peace , peace to him that is far off , and to him that is near , saith the Lord ; and I will heal him .
cry aloud , spare not , lift up THY voice like a trumpet , and shew my people their transgression , and the house of Jacob their sins .
Wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore have we afflicted our soul , and thou takest no knowledge ? behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
is not this the fast that I have chosen ? to loose the bands of wickedness , to undo the heavy burdens , and to let the oppressed go free , and that ye break every yoke ?
is it not to deal THY bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to THY house ? when thou seest the naked , that thou cover him ; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ?
then shall THY light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and THY righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the Lord shall be THY rereward .
then shalt thou call , and the Lord shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , Here I am . if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking vanity ;
and if thou draw out THY soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul ; then shall THY light rise in obscurity , and THY darkness be as the noonday :
and the Lord shall guide thee continually , and satisfy THY soul in drought , and make fat THY bones : and thou shalt be like a watered garden , and like a spring of water , whose waters fail not .
behold , the Lord 's hand is not shortened , that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy , that it cannot hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your God , and your sins have hid his face from you , that he will not hear .
for your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue hath muttered perverseness .
none calleth for justice , nor any pleadeth for truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
they Hatch cockatrice ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
their feet run to evil , and they make hast to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; wasting and destruction are in their paths .
the way of peace they know not ; and there is no judgment in their goings : they have made them crooked paths : whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace .
we grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the night ; we are in desolate places as dead men .
we roar all like bears , and mourn sore like doves : we look for judgment , but there is none ; for salvation , but it is far off from us .
for our transgressions are multiplied before thee , and our sins testify against us : for our transgressions are with us ; and as for our iniquities , we know them ;
in transgressing and lying against the Lord , and departing away from our God , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
Yea , truth faileth ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey : and the Lord saw it , and it displeased him that there was no judgment .
and he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his arm brought salvation unto him ; and his righteousness , it sustained him .
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and an helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloke .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , fury to his adversaries , recompence to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompence .
as for me , this is my Covenant with them , saith the Lord ; My spirit that is upon thee , and my words which I have put in THY mouth , shall not depart out of THY mouth , nor out of the mouth of THY seed , nor out of the mouth of THY seed 's seed , saith the Lord , from henceforth and for ever .
arise , shine ; for THY light is come , and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee .
for , behold , the darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the people : but the Lord shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen upon thee .
and the Gentiles shall come to THY light , and kings to the brightness of THY rising .
lift up thine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : THY sons shall come from far , and THY daughters shall be nursed at THY side .
then thou shalt see , and flow together , and thine heart shall fear , and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee , the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee .
the multitude of camels shall cover thee , the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come : they shall bring gold and incense ; and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord .
and the sons of strangers shall build up THY walls , and their kings shall minister unto thee : for in my wrath I smote thee , but in my favour have I had mercy on thee .
therefore THY gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
the glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee , the fir tree , the pine tree , and the box together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and I will make the place of my feet glorious .
the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee ; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of THY feet ; and they shall call thee , The city of the Lord , The Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the Lord am THY Saviour and THY Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
for brass I will bring gold , and for iron I will bring silver , and for wood brass , and for stones iron : I will also make THY officers peace , and thine exactors righteousness .
violence shall no more be heard in THY land , wasting nor destruction within THY borders ; but thou shalt call THY walls salvation , and THY gates Praise .
the sun shall be no more THY light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and THY God THY glory .
THY sun shall no more go down ; neither shall THY moon withdraw itself : for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of THY mourning shall be ended .
THY people also shall be all righteous : they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
and they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
but ye shall be named the priests of the Lord : men shall call you the Ministers of our God : ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles , and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves .
for your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .
and their seed shall be known among the Gentiles , and their offspring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed .
for as the earth bringeth forth her bud , and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
and the Gentiles shall see THY righteousness , and all kings THY glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the Lord shall name .
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord , and a royal diadem in the hand of THY God .
the Lord hath sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , surely I will no more give THY corn to be meat for thine enemies ; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink THY wine , for the which thou hast laboured :
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the Lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
behold , the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world , Say ye to the daughter of Zion , behold , THY salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
for the day of vengeance is in mine heart , and the year of my redeemed is come .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
and I will tread down the people in mine anger , and make them drunk in my fury , and I will bring down their strength to the earth .
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord , and the praises of the Lord , according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us , and the great Goodness toward the house of Israel , which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old .
but they rebelled , and vexed his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he fought against them .
as a beast goeth down into the valley , the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest : so didst thou lead THY people , to make thyself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of THY holiness and of THY glory : where is THY zeal and THY strength , the sounding of THY bowels and of THY mercies toward me ? are they restrained ?
doubtless thou art our father , though Abraham be ignorant of us , and Israel acknowledge us not : thou , O Lord , art our father , our redeemer ; THY name is from everlasting .
O Lord , why hast thou made us to err from THY ways , and hardened our heart from THY fear ? return for THY servants ' sake , the tribes of thine inheritance .
the people of THY holiness have possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down THY sanctuary .
we are thine : thou never barest rule over them ; they were not called by THY name .
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for , thou camest down , the mountains flowed down at THY presence .
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember thee in THY ways : behold , thou art wroth ; for we have sinned : in those is continuance , and we shall be saved .
but we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , have taken us away .
and there is none that calleth upon THY name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid THY face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our iniquities .
but now , O Lord , thou art our father ; we are the clay , and thou our Potter ; and we all are the work of THY hand .
be not wroth very sore , O Lord , neither remember iniquity for ever : behold , see , we beseech thee , we are all THY people .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned up with fire : and all our pleasant things are laid waste .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , which walketh in a way that was not good , after their own thoughts ;
which remain among the graves , and lodge in the monuments , which eat swine 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
which say , Stand by thyself , come not near to me ; for I am holier than thou . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
and I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
and Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me .
but ye are they that forsake the Lord , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that furnish the drink offering unto that number .
behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall howl for vexation of spirit .
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the Lord God shall slay thee , and call his servants by another name :
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create : for , behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
and I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
they shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord , and their offspring with them .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock : and dust shall be the serpent 's meat . they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
I also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears upon them ; because when I called , none did answer ; when I spake , they did not hear : but they did evil before mine eyes , and chose that in which I delighted not .
a voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies .
before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a man child .
rejoice ye with Jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn for her :
that ye may suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
for thus saith the Lord , behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream : then shall ye suck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be dandled upon her knees .
as one whom his mother comforteth , so will I comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem .
and when ye see this , your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like an herb : and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants , and his indignation toward his enemies .
for , behold , the Lord will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh : and the slain of the Lord shall be many .
for I know their works and their thoughts : it shall come , that I will gather all nations and tongues ; and they shall come , and see my glory .
for as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make , shall remain before me , saith the Lord , so shall your seed and your name remain .
and it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another , and from one sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , saith the Lord .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh .
the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah , of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee ; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee , and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations .
but the Lord said unto me , Say not , I am a child : for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
then the Lord put forth his hand , and touched my mouth . and the Lord said unto me , behold , I have put my words in THY mouth .
see , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying , Jeremiah , what seest thou ? and I said , I see a rod of an almond tree .
and the word of the Lord came unto me the second time , saying , What seest thou ? and I said , I see a seething pot ; and the face thereof is toward the north .
then the Lord said unto me , Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
and I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
Thou therefore gird up THY loins , and arise , and speak unto them all that I command thee : be not dismayed at their faces , lest I confound thee before them .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , saith the Lord , to deliver thee .
moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel :
thus saith the Lord , What iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
and I brought you into a plentiful country , to eat the fruit thereof and the Goodness thereof ; but when ye entered , ye defiled my land , and made mine heritage an abomination .
be astonished , O ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith the Lord .
for my people have committed two evils ; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters , and hewed them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
is Israel a servant ? is he a homeborn slave ? why is he spoiled ?
also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of THY head .
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the Lord THY God , when he led thee by the way ?
and now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the river ?
for of old time I have broken THY yoke , and burst THY bands ; and thou saidst , I will not transgress ; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , playing the harlot .
yet I had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me ?
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
withhold THY foot from being unshod , and THY throat from thirst : but thou saidst , There is no hope : no ; for I have loved strangers , and after them will I go .
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of Israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ,
but where are THY gods that thou hast made thee ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of THY trouble : for according to the number of THY cities are THY gods , O Judah .
in vain have I smitten your children ; they received no correction : your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
can a maid forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
why trimmest thou THY way to seek love ? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones THY ways .
also in THY skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents : I have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
yet thou sayest , Because I am innocent , surely his anger shall turn from me . behold , I will plead with thee , because thou sayest , I have not sinned .
why gaddest thou about so much to change THY way ? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt , as thou wast ashamed of Assyria .
Yea , thou shalt go forth from him , and thine hands upon thine head : for the Lord hath rejected THY confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; and thou hadst a whore 's forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me , My father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
and I said after she had done all these things , Turn thou unto me . but she returned not . and her treacherous sister Judah saw it .
and I saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that she defiled the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the Lord THY God , and hast scattered THY ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the Lord .
turn , O backsliding children , saith the Lord ; for I am married unto you : and I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion :
and I will give you pastors according to mine heart , which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart .
in those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
a voice was heard upon the high places , weeping and supplications of the children of Israel : for they have perverted their way , and they have forgotten the Lord their God .
return , ye backsliding children , and I will heal your backslidings . behold , we come unto thee ; for thou art the Lord our God .
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel .
for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth ; their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
and thou shalt swear , The Lord liveth , in truth , in judgment , and in righteousness ; and the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory .
for thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem , Break up your fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
declare ye in Judah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , blow ye the trumpet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assemble yourselves , and let us go into the defenced cities .
the lion is come up from his thicket , and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make THY land desolate ; and THY cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabitant .
for this gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl : for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back from us .
and it shall come to pass at that day , saith the Lord , that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the princes ; and the priests shall be astonished , and the prophets shall wonder .
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind : his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe unto us ! for we are spoiled .
O Jerusalem , wash thine heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved . how long shall THY vain thoughts lodge within thee ?
make ye mention to the nations ; behold , publish against Jerusalem , that watchers come from a far country , and give out their voice against the cities of Judah .
as keepers of a field , are they against her round about ; because she hath been rebellious against me , saith the Lord .
my bowels , my bowels ! I am pained at my very heart ; my heart maketh a noise in me ; I cannot hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is spoiled : suddenly are my tents spoiled , and my curtains in a moment .
for my people is foolish , they have not known me ; they are sottish children , and they have none understanding : they are wise to do evil , but to do good they have no knowledge .
I beheld the earth , and , lo , it was without form , and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
I beheld the mountains , and , lo , they trembled , and all the hills moved lightly .
I beheld , and , lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heavens were fled .
I beheld , and , lo , the fruitful place was a wilderness , and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord , and by his fierce anger .
for this shall the earth mourn , and the heavens above be black : because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and will not repent , neither will I turn back from it .
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen ; they shall go into thickets , and climb up upon the rocks : every city shall be forsaken , and not a man dwell therein .
run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places thereof , if ye can find a man , if there be any that executeth judgment , that seeketh the truth ; and I will pardon it .
therefore I said , surely these are poor ; they are foolish : for they know not the way of the Lord , nor the judgment of their God .
I will get me unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they have known the way of the Lord , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
how shall I pardon thee for this ? THY children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses .
they were as fed horses in the morning : every one neighed after his neighbour 's wife .
shall I not visit for these things ? saith the Lord : and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her battlements ; for they are not the Lord 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith the Lord .
and the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done unto them .
Lo , I will bring a nation upon you from far , O house of Israel , saith the Lord : it is a mighty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither understandest what they say .
and they shall eat up thine harvest , and THY bread , which THY sons and THY daughters should eat : they shall eat up THY flocks and thine herds : they shall eat up THY vines and THY fig trees : they shall impoverish THY fenced cities , wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
declare this in the house of Jacob , and publish it in Judah , saying ,
hear now this , O foolish people , and without understanding ; which have eyes , and see not ; which have ears , and hear not :
your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden good things from you .
for among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxen rich .
they are waxen fat , they shine : yea , they overpass the deeds of the wicked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , yet they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not judge .
the prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end thereof ?
the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
prepare ye war against her ; arise , and let us go up at noon . Woe unto us ! for the day goeth away , for the shadows of the evening are stretched out .
for thus hath the Lord of hosts said , Hew ye down trees , and cast a mount against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they cannot hearken : behold , the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
and their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , saith the Lord .
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
also I set watchmen over you , saying , Hearken to the sound of the trumpet . but they said , We will not hearken .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hearkened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
to what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices sweet unto me .
therefore thus saith the Lord , behold , I will lay stumblingblocks before this people , and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them ; the neighbour and his friend shall perish .
thus saith the Lord , behold , a people cometh from the north country , and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth .
they shall lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Zion .
we have heard the fame thereof : our hands wax feeble : anguish hath taken hold of us , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
O daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and wallow thyself in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lamentation : for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us .
I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people , that thou mayest know and try their way .
the bellows are burned , the lead is consumed of the fire ; the founder melteth in vain : for the wicked are not plucked away .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
stand in the gate of the Lord 's house , and proclaim there this word , and say , Hear the word of the Lord , all ye of Judah , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord .
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
trust ye not in lying words , saying , The temple of the Lord , The temple of the Lord , The temple of the Lord , are these .
for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour ;
if ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your hurt :
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , for ever and ever .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , even I have seen it , saith the Lord .
but go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel .
and now , because ye have done all these works , saith the Lord , and I spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
therefore will I do unto this house , which is called by my name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I have done to Shiloh .
and I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of Ephraim .
Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
the children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
do they provoke me to anger ? saith the Lord : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
for I spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but this thing commanded I them , saying , obey my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you , that it may be well unto you .
but they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear , but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart , and went backward , and not forward .
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
yet they hearkened not unto me , nor inclined their ear , but hardened their neck : they did worse than their fathers .
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight , saith the Lord : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to pollute it .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Tophet , nor the valley of the son of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in Tophet , till there be no place .
and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven , and for the beasts of the earth ; and none shall fray them away .
then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride : for the land shall be desolate .
at that time , saith the Lord , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , out of their graves :
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whither I have driven them , saith the Lord of hosts .
I hearkened and heard , but they spake not aright : no man repented him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? every one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
Yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .
how do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the Lord is with us ? Lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
the wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , saith the Lord .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of health , and behold trouble !
for , behold , I will send Serpents , cockatrices , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , saith the Lord .
when I would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart is faint in me .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; astonishment hath taken hold on me .
is there no balm in Gilead ; is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith the Lord .
take ye heed every one of his neighbour , and trust ye not in any brother : for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbour will walk with slanders .
and they will deceive every one his neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies , and weary themselves to commit iniquity .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he layeth his wait .
and I will make Jerusalem heaps , and a den of dragons ; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate , without an inhabitant .
and the Lord saith , Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ;
but have walked after the imagination of their own heart , and after Baalim , which their fathers taught them :
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; behold , I will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
I will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and I will send a sword after them , till I have consumed them .
thus saith the Lord of hosts , consider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for cunning women , that they may come :
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
for a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we spoiled ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because our dwellings have cast us out .
yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbour lamentation .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
thus saith the Lord , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches :
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised ;
hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you , O house of Israel :
thus saith the Lord , learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them .
for the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
they are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they cannot go . be not afraid of them ; for they cannot do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee , O Lord ; thou art great , and THY name is great in might .
who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
but the Lord is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
thus shall ye say unto them , The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heavens .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion .
when he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
every man is brutish in his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the Graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , and the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the Lord of hosts is his name .
for thus saith the Lord , behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
Woe is me for my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but I said , Truly this is a grief , and I must bear it .
my tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
for the pastors are become brutish , and have not sought the Lord : therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flocks shall be scattered .
behold , the noise of the bruit is come , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah desolate , and a den of dragons .
O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
pour out THY fury upon the heathen that know thee not , and upon the families that call not on THY name : for they have eaten up Jacob , and devoured him , and consumed him , and have made his habitation desolate .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
hear ye the words of this Covenant , and speak unto the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem ;
and say thou unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel ; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant ,
then the Lord said unto me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , Hear ye the words of this Covenant , and do them .
for I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , even unto this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obey my voice .
and the Lord said unto me , A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah , and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my Covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus saith the Lord , behold , I will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto me , I will not hearken unto them .
then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of THY cities were THY gods , O Judah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto Baal .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up a cry or prayer for them : for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble .
the Lord called THY name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for the Lord of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal .
but , O Lord of hosts , that judgest righteously , that triest the reins and the heart , let me see THY vengeance on them : for unto thee have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth , that seek THY life , saying , Prophesy not in the name of the Lord , that thou die not by our hand :
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , behold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine :
and there shall be no remnant of them : for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
Thou hast planted them , yea , they have taken root : they grow , yea , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in their mouth , and far from their reins .
but thou , O Lord , knowest me : thou hast seen me , and tried mine heart toward thee : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
for even THY brethren , and the house of THY father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
I have forsaken mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest ; it crieth out against me : therefore have I hated it .
many pastors have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have made it desolate , and being desolate it mourneth unto me ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man layeth it to heart .
the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness : for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh shall have peace .
they have sown wheat , but shall reap thorns : they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
thus saith the Lord against all mine evil neighbours , that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit ; behold , I will pluck them out of their land , and pluck out the house of Judah from among them .
and it shall come to pass , after that I have plucked them out I will return , and have compassion on them , and will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
thus saith the Lord unto me , Go and get thee a linen girdle , and put it upon THY loins , and put it not in water .
so I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord , and put it on my loins .
take the girdle that thou hast got , which is upon THY loins , and arise , go to Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
and it came to pass after many days , that the Lord said unto me , arise , go to Euphrates , and take the girdle from thence , which I commanded thee to hide there .
then I went to Euphrates , and digged , and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it : and , behold , the girdle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
this evil people , which refuse to hear my words , which walk in the imagination of their heart , and walk after other gods , to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this girdle , which is good for nothing .
therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word ; Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Every bottle shall be filled with wine : and they shall say unto thee , Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ?
and I will dash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , saith the Lord : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but destroy them .
give glory to the Lord your God , before he cause darkness , and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross darkness .
but if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tears , because the Lord 's flock is carried away captive .
say unto the king and to the queen , humble yourselves , sit down : for your principalities shall come down , even the crown of your glory .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Judah shall be carried away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carried away captive .
lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north : where is the flock that was given thee , THY beautiful flock ?
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee ? for thou hast taught them to be captains , and as chief over thee : shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
and if thou say in thine heart , Wherefore come these things upon me ? for the greatness of thine iniquity are THY skirts discovered , and THY heels made bare .
can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the Leopard his spots ? then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness .
this is THY lot , the portion of THY measures from me , saith the Lord ; because thou hast forgotten me , and trusted in falsehood .
therefore will I discover THY skirts upon THY face , that THY shame may appear .
the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth .
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
because the ground is chapt , for there was no rain in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed , they covered their heads .
Yea , the hind also calved in the field , and forsook it , because there was no grass .
and the wild asses did stand in the high places , they snuffed up the wind like dragons ; their eyes did fail , because there was no grass .
O the hope of Israel , the saviour thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night ?
why shouldest thou be as a man astonied , as a mighty man that cannot save ? yet thou , O Lord , art in the midst of us , and we are called by THY name ; leave us not .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation , I will not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
then said I , Ah , Lord God ! behold , the prophets say unto them , Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but I will give you assured peace in this place .
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them , them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters : for I will pour their wickedness upon them .
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
Hast thou utterly rejected Judah ? hath THY soul lothed Zion ? why hast thou smitten us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
we acknowledge , O Lord , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers : for we have sinned against thee .
do not abhor us , for THY name 's sake , do not disgrace the throne of THY glory : remember , break not THY Covenant with us .
then said the Lord unto me , Though Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind could not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
and I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas : I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday : I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly , and terrors upon the city .
the Lord said , Verily it shall be well with THY remnant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
THY substance and THY treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all THY sins , even in all THY borders .
O Lord , thou knowest : remember me , and visit me , and revenge me of my persecutors ; take me not away in THY longsuffering : know that for THY sake I have suffered rebuke .
THY words were found , and I did eat them ; and THY word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart : for I am called by THY name , O Lord God of hosts .
I sat not in the assembly of the mockers , nor rejoiced ; I sat alone because of THY hand : for thou hast filled me with indignation .
why is my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable , which refuseth to be healed ? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar , and as waters that fail ?
and I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , saith the Lord .
and I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
the word of the Lord came also unto me , saying ,
for thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that bare them , and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land ;
both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them :
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting , to sit with them to eat and to drink .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; behold , I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride .
and it shall come to pass , when thou shalt shew this people all these words , and they shall say unto thee , Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us ? or what is our iniquity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God ?
then shalt thou say unto them , Because your fathers have forsaken me , saith the Lord , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have worshipped them , and have forsaken me , and have not kept my law ;
and ye have done worse than your fathers ; for , behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart , that they may not hearken unto me :
therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not , neither ye nor your fathers ; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night ; where I will not shew you favour .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that it shall no more be said , The Lord liveth , that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for mine eyes are upon all their ways : they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes .
and first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double ; because they have defiled my land , they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things .
therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The Lord .
the sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is Graven upon the table of their heart , and upon the horns of your altars ;
O my mountain in the field , I will give THY substance and all THY treasures to the spoil , and THY high places for sin , throughout all THY borders .
and thou , even thyself , shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee ; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not : for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger , which shall burn for ever .
thus saith the Lord ; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man , and maketh flesh his arm , and whose heart departeth from the Lord .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
I the Lord search the heart , I try the reins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings .
as the partridge sitteth on eggs , and hatcheth them not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary .
O Lord , the hope of Israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the Lord , the fountain of living waters .
be not a terror unto me : thou art my hope in the day of evil .
let them be confounded that persecute me , but let not me be confounded : let them be dismayed , but let not me be dismayed : bring upon them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
thus said the Lord unto me ; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people , whereby the kings of Judah come in , and by the which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
and say unto them , Hear ye the word of the Lord , ye kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus saith the Lord ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day , neither do ye any work , but hallow ye the sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers .
but they obeyed not , neither inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , nor receive instruction .
and it shall come to pass , if ye diligently hearken unto me , saith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day , but hallow the sabbath day , to do no work therein ;
and they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places about Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the plain , and from the mountains , and from the south , bringing burnt offerings , and sacrifices , and meat offerings , and incense , and bringing sacrifices of praise , unto the house of the Lord .
the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
arise , and go down to the Potter 's house , and there I will cause thee to hear my words .
then I went down to the Potter 's house , and , behold , he wrought a work on the wheels .
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter : so he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the Potter to make it .
O house of Israel , cannot I do with you as this Potter ? saith the Lord . behold , as the clay is in the Potter 's hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ;
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if it do evil in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then I will repent of the good , wherewith I said I would benefit them .
and they said , There is no hope : but we will walk after our own devices , and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart .
will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken ?
because my people hath forgotten me , they have burned incense to vanity , and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths , to walk in paths , in a way not cast up ;
to make their land desolate , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and wag his head .
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
give heed to me , O Lord , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me .
therefore deliver up their children to the famine , and pour out their blood by the force of the sword ; and let their wives be bereaved of their children , and be widows ; and let their men be put to death ; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them : for they have digged a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
thus saith the Lord , Go and get a Potter 's earthen bottle , and take of the ancients of the people , and of the ancients of the priests ;
and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the east gate , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee ,
they have built also the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that this place shall no more be called Tophet , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter .
and I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hands of them that seek their lives : and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven , and for the beasts of the earth .
and I will make this city desolate , and an hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof .
and I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness , wherewith their enemies , and they that seek their lives , shall straiten them .
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee ,
thus will I do unto this place , saith the Lord , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as Tophet :
and the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of Judah , shall be defiled as the place of Tophet , because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven , and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods .
then came Jeremiah from Tophet , whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house ; and said to all the people ,
now Pashur the son of Immer the priest , who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things .
then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin , which was by the house of the Lord .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks . then said Jeremiah unto him , The Lord hath not called THY name Pashur , but Magor @-@ missabib .
moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the labours thereof , and all the precious things thereof , and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies , which shall spoil them , and take them , and carry them to Babylon .
O Lord , thou hast deceived me , and I was deceived : thou art stronger than I , and hast prevailed : I am in derision daily , every one mocketh me .
for since I spake , I cried out , I cried violence and spoil ; because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me , and a derision , daily .
but the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O Lord of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see THY vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
sing unto the Lord , praise ye the Lord : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers .
Cursed be the day wherein I was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed .
Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , A man child is born unto thee ; making him very glad .
and let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew , and repented not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the shouting at noontide ;
because he slew me not from the womb ; or that my mother might have been my grave , and her womb to be always great with me .
Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , saying ,
inquire , I pray thee , of the Lord for us ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us ; if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works , that he may go up from us .
and I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
and I will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth out , and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
for I have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith the Lord : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
and touching the house of the king of Judah , say , Hear ye the word of the Lord ;
behold , I am against thee , O inhabitant of the valley , and rock of the plain , saith the Lord ; which say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
but I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the Lord : and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it .
thus saith the Lord ; Go down to the house of the king of Judah , and speak there this word ,
and say , Hear the word of the Lord , O king of Judah , that sittest upon the throne of David , thou , and THY servants , and THY people that enter in by these gates :
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
and I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down THY choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city ?
Weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan him : but weep sore for him that goeth away : for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
for thus saith the Lord touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah , which reigned instead of Josiah his father , which went forth out of this place ; He shall not return thither any more :
but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive , and shall see this land no more .
Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness , and his chambers by wrong ; that useth his neighbour 's service without wages , and giveth him not for his work ;
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for THY covetousness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up THY voice in Bashan , and cry from the passages : for all THY lovers are destroyed .
I spake unto thee in THY prosperity ; but thou saidst , I will not hear . this hath been THY manner from THY youth , that thou obeyedst not my voice .
the wind shall eat up all THY pastors , and THY lovers shall go into captivity : surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all THY wickedness .
and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek THY life , and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest , even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
and I will cast thee out , and THY mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
but to the land whereunto they desire to return , thither shall they not return .
is this man Coniah a despised broken idol ? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure ? wherefore are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
and I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the Lord .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch , and a King shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
in his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell safely : and this is his name whereby he shall be called , the Lord our RIGHTEOUSNESS .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that they shall no more say , The Lord liveth , which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , saith the Lord .
and I have seen Folly in the prophets of Samaria ; they prophesied in Baal , and caused my people Israel to err .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets ; behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
they say still unto them that despise me , The Lord hath said , Ye shall have peace ; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart , No evil shall come upon you .
for who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
behold , a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury , even a grievous whirlwind : it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked .
the anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
but if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies ? yea , they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ;
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal .
the prophet that hath a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hath my word , let him speak my word faithfully . what is the chaff to the wheat ? saith the Lord .
therefore , behold , I am against the prophets , saith the Lord , that steal my words every one from his neighbour .
and when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , saying , What is the burden of the Lord ? thou shalt then say unto them , What burden ? I will even forsake you , saith the Lord .
and as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , The burden of the Lord , I will even punish that man and his house .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , What hath the Lord answered ? and , What hath the Lord spoken ?
and the burden of the Lord shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of the Lord of hosts our God .
but since ye say , The burden of the Lord ; therefore thus saith the Lord ; Because ye say this word , The burden of the Lord , and I have sent unto you , saying , Ye shall not say , The burden of the Lord ;
therefore , behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will forsake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence :
and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
one basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Like these good figs , so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pluck them up .
and I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the Lord : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
and I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places whither I shall drive them .
and I will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ;
the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying ,
from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the Lord hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
and the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
and go not after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the candle .
and it shall come to pass , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , saith the Lord , for their iniquity , and the land of the Chaldeans , and will make it perpetual desolations .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the works of their own hands .
for thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me ; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send thee , to drink it .
and they shall drink , and be moved , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at the Lord 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the Lord had sent me :
to wit , Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ;
Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Azzah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ,
and all the kings of Tyrus , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ,
Dedan , and TEMA , and Buz , and all that are in the utmost corners ,
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ,
and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Ye shall certainly drink .
a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth ; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations , he will plead with all flesh ; he will give them that are wicked to the sword , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord of hosts , behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
and the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be Dung upon the ground .
Howl , ye shepherds , and cry ; and wallow yourselves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and an howling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture .
and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
he hath forsaken his covert , as the lion : for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the Lord , saying ,
thus saith the Lord ; Stand in the court of the Lord 's house , and speak unto all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in the Lord 's house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord ; If ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .
now it came to pass , when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Thou shalt surely die .
when the princes of Judah heard these things , then they came up from the king 's house unto the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house .
then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the Lord your God ; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
as for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and when Jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Urijah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , namely , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and certain men with him into Egypt .
and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king ; who slew him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the Ammonites , and to the king of Tyrus , and to the king of Zidon , by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah ;
and command them to say unto their masters , Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say unto your masters ;
I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
and all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
therefore hearken not ye to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreamers , nor to your enchanters , nor to your sorcerers , which speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they prophesy a lie unto you , to remove you far from your land ; and that I should drive you out , and ye should perish .
I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
why will ye die , thou and THY people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon : for they prophesy a lie unto you .
for I have not sent them , saith the Lord , yet they prophesy a lie in my name ; that I might drive you out , and that ye might perish , ye , and the prophets that prophesy unto you .
Yea , thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem ;
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be until the day that I visit them , saith the Lord ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
and it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , and in the fifth month , that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet , which was of Gibeon , spake unto me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah , that went into Babylon , saith the Lord : for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord ,
nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the Lord hath truly sent him .
then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and brake it .
then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
therefore thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord .
( after that Jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , and the carpenters , and the Smiths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah , ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) saying ,
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , unto all that are carried away captives , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon ;
build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them ;
take ye wives , and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
and seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the Lord for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Let not your prophets and your diviners , that be in the midst of you , deceive you , neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed .
for thus saith the Lord , That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
then shall ye call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and I will hearken unto you .
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
know that thus saith the Lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David , and of all the people that dwelleth in this city , and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity ;
thus saith the Lord of hosts ; behold , I will send upon them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that cannot be eaten , they are so evil .
because they have not hearkened to my words , saith the Lord , which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but ye would not hear , saith the Lord .
hear ye therefore the word of the Lord , all ye of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon :
because they have committed villany in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbours ' wives , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not commanded them ; even I know , and am a witness , saith the Lord .
thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying ,
thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in THY name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
the Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth , which maketh himself a prophet to you ?
for therefore he sent unto us in Babylon , saying , This captivity is long : build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah , saying ,
send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite ; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
and these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah .
ask ye now , and see whether a man doth travail with child ? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
Alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
for it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord of hosts , that I will break his yoke from off THY neck , and will burst THY bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
but they shall serve the Lord their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up unto them .
there is none to plead THY cause , that thou mayest be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines .
all THY lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not ; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because THY sins were increased .
why criest thou for thine affliction ? THY sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity : because THY sins were increased , I have done these things unto thee .
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured ; and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey .
for I will restore health unto thee , and I will heal thee of THY wounds , saith the Lord ; because they called thee an outcast , saying , This is Zion , whom no man seeketh after .
thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will bring again the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have mercy on his dwellingplaces ; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
and out of them shall proceed Thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
their children also shall be as aforetime , and their Congregation shall be established before me , and I will punish all that oppress them .
behold , the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury , a continuing whirlwind : it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked .
the fierce anger of the Lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
thus saith the Lord , The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness ; even Israel , when I went to cause him to rest .
the Lord hath appeared of old unto me , saying , Yea , I have loved thee with an everlasting love : therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee .
again I will build thee , and thou shalt be built , O virgin of Israel : thou shalt again be adorned with THY tabrets , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria : the planters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry , arise ye , and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God .
for thus saith the Lord ; sing with gladness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , O Lord , save THY people , the remnant of Israel .
hear the word of the Lord , O ye nations , and declare it in the isles afar off , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd doth his flock .
for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob , and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
and I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my Goodness , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord ; refrain THY voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears : for THY work shall be rewarded , saith the Lord ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
and there is hope in thine end , saith the Lord , that THY children shall come again to their own border .
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus ; Thou hast chastised me , and I was chastised , as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke : turn thou me , and I shall be turned ; for thou art the Lord my God .
surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after that I was instructed , I smote upon my thigh : I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because I did bear the reproach of my youth .
set thee up waymarks , make thee high heaps : set thine heart toward the highway , even the way which thou wentest : turn again , O virgin of Israel , turn again to these THY cities .
how long wilt thou go about , O thou backsliding daughter ? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth , A woman shall compass a man .
and there shall dwell in Judah itself , and in all the cities thereof together , husbandmen , and they that go forth with flocks .
upon this I awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
and it shall come to pass , that like as I have watched over them , to pluck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to afflict ; so will I watch over them , to build , and to plant , saith the Lord .
in those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten a sour grape , and the children 's teeth are set on edge .
but every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah :
not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt ; which my Covenant they brake , although I was an husband unto them , saith the Lord :
if those ordinances depart from before me , saith the Lord , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
thus saith the Lord ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , saith the Lord .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner .
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb , and shall compass about to Goath .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar .
for then the king of Babylon 's army besieged Jerusalem : and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there shall he be until I visit him , saith the Lord : though ye fight with the Chaldeans , ye shall not prosper ?
behold , Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee , saying , Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth : for the right of redemption is thine to buy it .
and I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle 's son , that was in Anathoth , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
and I subscribed the evidence , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
so I took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom , and that which was open :
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed unto the Lord , saying ,
Ah Lord God ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by THY great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the Great , the mighty God , the Lord of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even unto this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day ;
and hast brought forth THY people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with great terror ;
and hast given them this land , which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
and they came in , and possessed it ; but they obeyed not THY voice , neither walked in THY law ; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do : therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them :
and thou hast said unto me , O Lord God , Buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses ; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
behold , I am the Lord , the God of all flesh : is there any thing too hard for me ?
therefore thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the Lord .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
and they have turned unto me the back , and not the face : though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction .
but they set their abominations in the house , which is called by my name , to defile it .
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
and I will make an everlasting Covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
Yea , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
for thus saith the Lord ; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people , so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them .
and fields shall be bought in this land , whereof ye say , It is desolate without man or beast ; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
thus saith the Lord the maker thereof , the Lord that formed it , to establish it ; the Lord is his name ;
call unto me , and I will answer thee , and shew thee great and mighty things , which thou knowest not .
for thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down by the mounts , and by the sword ;
and I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Again in this place , which is desolate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
in the cities of the mountains , in the cities of the vale , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the places about Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them , saith the Lord .
behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
in those days , and at that time , will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
in those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , The Lord our righteousness .
for thus saith the Lord ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings , and to kindle meat offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
and the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah , saying ,
as the host of heaven cannot be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured : so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites that minister unto me .
moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , saying ,
Considerest thou not what this people have spoken , saying , The two families which the Lord hath chosen , he hath even cast them off ? thus they have despised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
thus saith the Lord ; If my Covenant be not with day and night , and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ;
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion , and all the people , fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
yet hear the word of the Lord , O Zedekiah king of Judah ; Thus saith the Lord of thee , Thou shalt not die by the sword :
when the king of Babylon 's army fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish , and against Azekah : for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah .
this is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , after that the king Zedekiah had made a Covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
that every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a Jew his brother .
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; I made a Covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew , which hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee : but your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
but ye turned and polluted my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection , to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth .
and Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
go unto the house of the Rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habaziniah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ;
and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine , and cups , and I said unto them , Drink ye wine .
thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , nor our daughters ;
nor to build houses for us to dwell in : neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
but we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
but it came to pass , when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words ? saith the Lord .
because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father , which he commanded them ; but this people hath not hearkened unto me :
and it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying ,
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spake unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah : and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
and Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , I am shut up ; I cannot go into the house of the Lord :
therefore go thou , and read in the roll , which thou hast written from my mouth , the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fasting day : and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supplication before the Lord , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against this people .
and Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem .
then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Michaiah the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord ,
then he went down into the king 's house , into the scribe 's chamber : and , lo , all the princes sat there , even Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , unto Baruch , saying , Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come . so Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand , and came unto them .
now it came to pass , when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one and other , and said unto Baruch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the ears of the king .
so the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elishama the scribe 's chamber . and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month : and there was a fire on the Hearth burning before him .
yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
but the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet : but the Lord hid them .
then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , saying ,
take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned .
therefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the Frost .
and king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the Lord , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah .
and Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , pray now unto the Lord our God for us .
now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people : for they had not put him into prison .
then Pharoah 's army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel ; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me ; behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
and the Chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and burn it with fire .
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh 's army ,
then said Jeremiah , It is false ; I fall not away to the Chaldeans . but he hearkened not to him : so Irijah took Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
when Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon , and into the cabins , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ;
moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah , What have I offended against thee , or against THY servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ?
where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
therefore hear now , I pray thee , O my lord the king : let my supplication , I pray thee , be accepted before thee ; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
then Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashur the son of Malchiah , heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people , saying ,
thus saith the Lord , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jeremiah with cords . and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Jeremiah sunk in the mire .
now when Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , one of the eunuchs which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
Ebed @-@ melech went forth out of the king 's house , and spake to the king , saying ,
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
then the king commanded Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
so Ebed @-@ melech took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
and Ebed @-@ melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah , Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords . and Jeremiah did so .
so they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
then Zedekiah the king sent , and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and the king said unto Jeremiah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
but Jeremiah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I beseech thee , the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and THY soul shall live .
but if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me :
so they shall bring out all THY wives and THY children to the Chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
but if the princes hear that I have talked with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death ; also what the king said unto thee :
then thou shalt say unto them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan 's house , to die there .
then came all the princes unto Jeremiah , and asked him : and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
so Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken : and he was there when Jerusalem was taken .
in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they beseiged it .
and in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
and it came to pass , that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them , and all the men of war , then they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , by the gate betwixt the two walls : and he went out the way of the plain .
but the Chaldeans ' army pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah .
moreover he put out Zedekiah 's eyes , and bound him with chains , to carry him to Babylon .
and the Chaldeans burned the king 's house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of Jerusalem .
then Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard , saying ,
so Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard sent , and Nebushasban , Rab @-@ saris , and Nergal @-@ sharezer , Rabmag , and all the king of Babylon 's princes ;
even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
but I will deliver thee in that day , saith the Lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but THY life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put THY trust in me , saith the Lord .
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after that Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
and the captain of the guard took Jeremiah , and said unto him , The Lord THY God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
now the Lord hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sinned against the Lord , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land .
now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields , even they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land , and had committed unto him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon ;
then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
and Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men , saying , Fear not to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
as for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans , which will come unto us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , unto Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ,
and said unto him , Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee ? but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not .
but Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah , Thou shalt not do this thing : for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael .
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah ; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah .
then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and the ten men that were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and slew him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him , even with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
and it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
but when Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
so all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned , and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah .
but Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the Ammonites .
that the Lord THY God may shew us the way wherein we may walk , and the thing that we may do .
then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them , I have heard you ; behold , I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you , I will declare it unto you ; I will keep nothing back from you .
then they said to Jeremiah , The Lord be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord THY God shall send thee to us .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the Lord our God , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of the Lord our God .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah .
then called he Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and said unto them , Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him ;
if ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pluck you up : for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you .
be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the Lord : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
and I will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
but if ye say , We will not dwell in this land , neither obey the voice of the Lord your God ,
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now therefore hear the word of the Lord , ye remnant of Judah ; Thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them .
for ye dissembled in your hearts , when ye sent me unto the Lord your God , saying , pray for us unto the Lord our God ; and according unto all that the Lord our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it .
and now I have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
and it came to pass , that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God , for which the Lord their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
so Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the Lord , to dwell in the land of Judah .
but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Judah ;
so they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of Judah ;
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
he shall break also the images of Beth @-@ shemesh , that is in the land of Egypt ; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire .
the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets , rising early and sending them , saying , Oh , do not this abominable thing that I hate .
but they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they have committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
they are not humbled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; behold , I will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all Judah .
for I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods , and all the women that stood by , a great multitude , even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto her , we have wanted all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
then Jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
so that the Lord could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without an inhabitant , as at this day .
moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , Hear the word of the Lord , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
and this shall be a sign unto you , saith the Lord , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
the word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying ,
Thou didst say , Woe is me now ! for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow ; I fainted in my sighing , and I find no rest .
thus shalt thou say unto him , The Lord saith thus ; behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pluck up , even this whole land .
the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles ;
against Egypt , against the army of Pharaoh @-@ necho king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah .
harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines .
Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled Apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the Lord .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stumble , and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates .
who is this that cometh up as a flood , whose waters are moved as the rivers ?
Egypt riseth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he saith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiopians and the Libyans , that handle the shield ; and the Lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gilead , and take balm , O virgin , the daughter of Egypt : in vain shalt thou use many medicines ; for thou shalt not be cured .
the nations have heard of THY shame , and THY cry hath filled the land : for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the Lord spake to Jeremiah the prophet , how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
he made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
they did cry there , Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ; he hath passed the time appointed .
Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , saith the Lord , though it cannot be searched ; because they are more than the grasshoppers , and are innumerable .
the daughter of Egypt shall be confounded ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel , saith ; behold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Pharaoh , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the Lord .
but fear not thou , O my servant Jacob , and be not dismayed , O Israel : for , behold , I will save thee from afar off , and THY seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines , before that Pharaoh smote Gaza .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
O thou sword of the Lord , how long will it be ERE thou be quiet ? put up thyself into THY scabbard , rest , and be still .
how can it be quiet , seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon , and against the sea shore ? there hath he appointed it .
Moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
for in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
for because thou hast trusted in THY works and in THY treasures , thou shalt also be taken : and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together .
and the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the Lord hath spoken .
give wings unto Moab , that it may flee and get away : for the cities thereof shall be desolate , without any to dwell therein .
Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully , and Cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood .
Moab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will send unto him wanderers , that shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles .
and Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence .
Moab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , saith the King , whose name is the Lord of hosts .
all ye that are about him , bemoan him ; and all ye that know his name , say , How is the strong staff broken , and the beautiful rod !
Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon , come down from THY glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy THY strong holds .
Moab is confounded ; for it is broken down : howl and cry ; and tell ye it in Arnon , that Moab is spoiled ,
and judgment is come upon the plain country ; upon Holon , and upon Jahazah , and upon Mephaath ,
the Horn of Moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith the Lord .
make ye him drunken : for he magnified himself against the Lord : Moab also shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
for was not Israel a derision unto thee ? was he found among thieves ? for since thou spakest of him , thou skippedst for joy .
O ye that dwell in Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock , and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole 's mouth .
we have heard the pride of Moab , ( he is exceeding proud ) his loftiness , and his arrogancy , and his pride , and the haughtiness of his heart .
I know his wrath , saith the Lord ; but it shall not be so ; his lies shall not so effect it .
therefore will I howl for Moab , and I will cry out for all Moab ; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kir @-@ heres .
O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer : THY plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jazer : the spoiler is fallen upon THY summer fruits and upon THY vintage .
from the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh , and even unto Jahaz , have they uttered their voice , from Zoar even unto Horonaim , as an heifer of three years old : for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate .
moreover I will cause to cease in Moab , saith the Lord , him that offereth in the high places , and him that burneth incense to his gods .
therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir @-@ heres : because the riches that he hath gotten are perished .
for every head shall be bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands shall be cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab , and in the streets thereof : for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure , saith the Lord .
Kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men 's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , shall be upon thee , O inhabitant of Moab , saith the Lord .
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon it , even upon Moab , the year of their visitation , saith the Lord .
they that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and shall devour the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
Woe be unto thee , O Moab ! the people of Chemosh perisheth : for THY sons are taken captives , and THY daughters captives .
Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys , THY flowing valley , O backsliding daughter ? that trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come unto me ?
behold , I will bring a fear upon thee , saith the Lord God of hosts , from all those that be about thee ; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth ; and none shall gather up him that wandereth .
and afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon , saith the Lord .
flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , O inhabitants of Dedan ; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him , the time that I will visit him .
if grapegatherers come to thee , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? if thieves by night , they will destroy till they have enough .
but I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for thus saith the Lord ; behold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken ; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished ? thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
I have heard a rumour from the Lord , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , Gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the Lord , no man shall abide there , neither shall a son of man dwell in it .
therefore hear the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them .
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
concerning Damascus . Hamath is confounded , and Arpad : for they have heard evil tidings : they are fainthearted ; there is sorrow on the sea ; it cannot be quiet .
Damascus is waxed feeble , and turneth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken her , as a woman in travail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the Lord of hosts .
and I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus , and it shall consume the palaces of Ben @-@ hadad .
concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite , thus saith the Lord ; arise ye , go up to Kedar , and spoil the men of the east .
their tents and their flocks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry unto them , Fear is on every side .
flee , get you far off , dwell deep , O ye inhabitants of Hazor , saith the Lord ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
and their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil : and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners ; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , saith the Lord .
and Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it .
the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
and upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
and I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the Lord .
but it shall come to pass in the latter days , that I will bring again the captivity of Elam , saith the Lord .
the word that the Lord spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet .
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
in those days , and in that time , saith the Lord , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together , going and weeping : they shall go , and seek the Lord their God .
they shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward , saying , Come , and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that shall not be forgotten .
my people hath been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their restingplace .
all that found them have devoured them : and their adversaries said , We offend not , because they have sinned against the Lord , the habitation of justice , even the Lord , the hope of their fathers .
remove out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the he goats before the flocks .
because ye were glad , because ye rejoiced , O ye destroyers of mine heritage , because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass , and Bellow as bulls ;
your mother shall be sore confounded ; she that bare you shall be ashamed : behold , the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate : every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
put yourselves in array against Babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against the Lord .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
Israel is a scattered sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first the king of Assyria hath devoured him ; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones .
therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
and I will bring Israel again to his habitation , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead .
in those days , and in that time , saith the Lord , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
go up against the land of Merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pekod : waste and utterly destroy after them , saith the Lord , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
a sound of battle is in the land , and of great destruction .
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken ! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations !
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the Lord .
the Lord hath opened his armoury , and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation : for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans .
come against her from the utmost border , open her storehouses : cast her up as heaps , and destroy her utterly : let nothing of her be left .
Slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the Lord .
and the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him .
thus saith the Lord of hosts ; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together : and all that took them captives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
their Redeemer is strong ; the Lord of hosts is his name : he shall throughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a sword is upon the Chaldeans , saith the Lord , and upon the inhabitants of Babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
a sword is upon the liars ; and they shall dote : a sword is upon her mighty men ; and they shall be dismayed .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of Graven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there , and the owls shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation .
as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the Lord ; so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man dwell therein .
behold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
the king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands waxed feeble : anguish took hold of him , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Babylon ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them .
at the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will raise up against Babylon , and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me , a destroying wind ;
and will send unto Babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets .
for Israel hath not been forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of the Lord of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the Lord 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord 's hand , that made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunken of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : howl for her ; take balm for her pain , if so she may be healed .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reacheth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
the Lord hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shields : the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the Lord , the vengeance of his temple .
O thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , and the measure of THY covetousness .
the Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , surely I will fill thee with men , as with caterpillers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding .
when he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens ; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth : he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the Graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
they are vanity , the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the Lord of hosts is his name .
Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war : for with thee will I break in pieces the nations , and with thee will I destroy kingdoms ;
and with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his Rider ; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his Rider ;
with thee also will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers .
and I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , saith the Lord .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , saith the Lord , which destroyest all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the Lord .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
and the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon , to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts , the God of Israel ; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor , it is time to thresh her : yet a little while , and the time of her harvest shall come .
therefore thus saith the Lord ; behold , I will plead THY cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
in their heat I will make their feasts , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the Lord .
the sea is come up upon Babylon : she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof .
her cities are a desolation , a dry land , and a wilderness , a land wherein no man dwelleth , neither doth any son of man pass thereby .
and I will punish Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him : yea , the wall of Babylon shall fall .
my people , go ye out of the midst of her , and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord .
therefore , behold , the days come , that I will do judgment upon the Graven images of Babylon : and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for Babylon : for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north , saith the Lord .
Ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the Lord afar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach : shame hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the Lord 's house .
Wherefore , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , that I will do judgment upon her Graven images : and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
though Babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall spoilers come unto her , saith the Lord .
a sound of a cry cometh from Babylon , and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans :
because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do roar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered :
because the spoiler is come upon her , even upon Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , every one of their bows is broken : for the Lord God of recompences shall surely requite .
so Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon , even all these words that are written against Babylon .
and Jeremiah said to Seraiah , When thou comest to Babylon , and shalt see , and shalt read all these words ;
then shalt thou say , O Lord , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
and it shall be , when thou hast made an end of reading this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of Euphrates :
and thou shalt say , Thus shall Babylon sink , and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her : and they shall be weary . thus far are the words of Jeremiah .
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was sore in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
but the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; where he gave judgment upon him .
and the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , came Nebuzar @-@ adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
and burned the house of the Lord , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , and all the houses of the great men , burned he with fire :
and all the army of the Chaldeans , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about .
then Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people , and the residue of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
but Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen .
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
the caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
the two pillars , one sea , and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord : the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was Eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
and a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side ; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about .
and the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door :
so Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath . thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
this is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty :
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons :
in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar @-@ adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
and spake kindly unto him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon ,
and changed his prison garments : and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life .
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
how doth the city sit solitary , that was full of people how is she become as a widow she that was was great among the nations , and princess among the provinces , how is she become tributary
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors overtook her between the straits .
the ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feasts : all her gates are desolate : her priests sigh , her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
her adversaries are the chief , her enemies prosper ; for the Lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions : her children are gone into captivity before the enemy .
and from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
her filthiness is in her skirts ; she remembereth not her last end ; therefore she came down wonderfully : she had no comforter . O Lord , behold my affliction : for the enemy hath magnified himself .
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things : for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary , whom thou didst command that they should not enter into THY Congregation .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me desolate and faint all the day .
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , and come up upon my neck : he hath made my strength to fall , the Lord hath delivered me into their hands , from whom I am not able to rise up .
the Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me : he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men : the Lord hath trodden the virgin , the daughter of Judah , as in a winepress .
for these things I weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water , because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me : my children are desolate , because the enemy prevailed .
Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
the Lord is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
behold , O Lord ; for I am in distress : my bowels are troubled ; mine heart is turned within me ; for I have grievously rebelled : abroad the sword bereaveth , at home there is as death .
let all their wickedness come before thee ; and do unto them , as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
the Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob , and hath not pitied : he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah ; he hath brought them down to the ground : he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof .
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion : he poured out his fury like fire .
the Lord was as an enemy : he hath swallowed up Israel , he hath swallowed up all her palaces : he hath destroyed his strong holds , and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
the Lord hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary , he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a solemn feast .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the Gentiles : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord .
the elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon their heads ; they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
they say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
THY prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered thine iniquity , to turn away THY captivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they hiss and gnash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
the Lord hath done that which he had devised ; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old : he hath thrown down , and hath not pitied : and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee , he hath set up the Horn of thine adversaries .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up THY hands toward him for the life of THY young children , that faint for hunger in the top of every street .
behold , O Lord , and consider to whom thou hast done this . shall the women eat their fruit , and children of a span long ? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
he hath led me , and brought me into darkness , but not into light .
surely against me is he turned ; he turneth his hand against me all the day .
my flesh and my skin hath he made old ; he hath broken my bones .
he hath set me in dark places , as they that be dead of old .
he hath hedged me about , that I cannot get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone , he hath made my paths crooked .
he was unto me as a bear lying in wait , and as a lion in secret places .
he hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hath made me desolate .
he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins .
he hath filled me with bitterness , he hath made me drunken with wormwood .
he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones , he hath covered me with ashes .
and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace : I forgat prosperity .
my soul hath them still in remembrance , and is humbled in me .
this I recall to my mind , therefore have I hope .
the Lord is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul that seeketh him .
it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
he putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope .
he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him : he is filled full with reproach .
but though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies .
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High ,
who is he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the Lord commandeth it not ?
let us search and try our ways , and turn again to the Lord .
let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens .
Thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud , that our prayer should not pass through .
Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people .
mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
mine eye trickleth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city .
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and cast a stone upon me .
I called upon THY name , O Lord , out of the low dungeon .
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee : thou saidst , Fear not .
O Lord , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
behold their sitting down , and their rising up ; I am their musick .
render unto them a recompence , O Lord , according to the work of their hands .
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most fine gold changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street .
the precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the Potter !
even the sea monsters draw out the breast , they give suck to their young ones : the daughter of my people is become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom , that was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
her Nazarites were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk , they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was of sapphire :
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the Lord hath accomplished his fury ; he hath poured out his fierce anger , and hath kindled a fire in Zion , and it hath devoured the foundations thereof .
the kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem .
for the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
they have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
the anger of the Lord hath divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the priests , they favoured not the elders .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
they hunt our steps , that we cannot go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven : they pursued us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the breath of our nostrils , the anointed of the Lord , was taken in their pits , of whom we said , Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen .
rejoice and be glad , O daughter of Edom , that dwellest in the land of Uz ; the cup also shall pass through unto thee : thou shalt be drunken , and shalt make thyself naked .
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity : he will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; he will discover THY sins .
we have given the hand to the Egyptians , and to the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
servants have ruled over us : there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand .
we gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
they ravished the women in Zion , and the maids in the cities of Judah .
princes are hanged up by their hand : the faces of elders were not honoured .
the joy of our heart is ceased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
the crown is fallen from our head : woe unto us , that we have sinned !
because of the mountain of Zion , which is desolate , the foxes walk upon it .
turn thou us unto thee , O Lord , and we shall be turned ; renew our days as of old .
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
in the fifth day of the month , which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin 's captivity ,
and I looked , and , behold , a whirlwind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the colour of Amber , out of the midst of the fire .
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance ; they had the likeness of a man .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings .
their wings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
and they went every one straight forward : whither the spirit was to go , they went ; and they turned not when they went .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , and like the appearance of lamps : it went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
now as I beheld the living creatures , behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures , with his four faces .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
when they went , they went upon their four sides : and they turned not when they went .
as for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
and when the living creatures went , the wheels went by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal , stretched forth over their heads above .
and under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and when they went , I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almighty , the voice of speech , as the noise of an host : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads , when they stood , and had let down their wings .
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and I saw as the colour of Amber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his loins even upward , and from the appearance of his loins even downward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had brightness round about .
and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me , and set me upon my feet , that I heard him that spake unto me .
and he said unto me , Son of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me : they and their fathers have transgressed against me , even unto this very day .
for they are impudent children and stiffhearted . I do send thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house , ) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear : for they are most rebellious .
but thou , son of man , hear what I say unto thee ; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open THY mouth , and eat that I give thee .
and when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
and he spread it before me ; and it was written within and without : and there was written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
and he said unto me , Son of man , cause THY belly to eat , and fill THY bowels with this roll that I give thee . then did I eat it ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
and he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
but the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto me : for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted .
behold , I have made THY face strong against their faces , and THY forehead strong against their foreheads .
as an adamant harder than Flint have I made THY forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
and go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of THY people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Thus saith the Lord God ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place .
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the captivity at Tel @-@ abib , that dwelt by the river of Chebar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered THY soul .
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man , that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall surely live , because he is warned ; also thou hast delivered THY soul .
and the hand of the Lord was there upon me ; and he said unto me , arise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the Lord stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and spake with me , and said unto me , Go , shut thyself within thine house .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make THY tongue cleave to the roof of THY mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
but when I speak with thee , I will open THY mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
Thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even Jerusalem :
and lay siege against it , and build a Fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
lie thou also upon THY left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity .
for I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days : so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
and when thou hast accomplished them , lie again on THY right side , and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days : I have appointed thee each day for a year .
therefore thou shalt set THY face toward the siege of Jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of THY siege .
and THY meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
Thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes , and thou shalt bake it with Dung that cometh out of man , in their sight .
and the Lord said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles , whither I will drive them .
that they may want bread and water , and be astonied one with another , and consume away for their iniquity .
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a Barber 's rasor , and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon THY beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind them in THY skirts .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus saith the Lord God ; This is Jerusalem : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ;
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
and I will do in thee that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
Wherefore , as I live , saith the Lord God ; surely , because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all THY detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also diminish thee ; neither shall mine eye spare , neither will I have any pity .
moreover I will make thee waste , and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord God ; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys ; behold , I , even I , will bring a sword upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
and your altars shall be desolate , and your images shall be broken : and I will cast down your slain men before your idols .
and I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
yet will I leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
so will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath , in all their habitations : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord God unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to THY ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense THY ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
an end is come , the end is come : it watcheth for thee ; behold , it is come .
the morning is come unto thee , O thou that dwellest in the land : the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the sounding again of the mountains .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to THY ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense thee according to THY ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth .
behold the day , behold , it is come : the morning is gone forth ; the rod hath blossomed , pride hath budded .
violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness : none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of any of theirs : neither shall there be wailing for them .
the time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn : for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life .
they have blown the trumpet , even to make all ready ; but none goeth to the battle : for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
the sword is without , and the pestilence and the famine within : he that is in the field shall die with the sword ; and he that is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his iniquity .
all hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
as for the beauty of his ornament , he set it in majesty : but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
and I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall pollute it .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall pollute my secret place : for the robbers shall enter into it , and defile it .
make a chain : for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be defiled .
destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
Mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the ancients .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Judah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me .
then I beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of Amber .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
and he brought me to the door of the court ; and when I looked , behold a hole in the wall .
then said he unto me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had digged in the wall , behold a door .
so I went in and saw ; and behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about .
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord 's house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz .
then said he unto me , Hast thou seen this , O son of man ? turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations than these .
and he brought me into the inner court of the Lord 's house , and , behold , at the door of the temple of the Lord , between the porch and the altar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temple of the Lord , and their faces toward the east ; and they worshipped the sun toward the east .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer 's inkhorn by his side ;
and the Lord said unto him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , Go ye after him through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity :
and he said unto them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain : go ye forth . and they went forth , and slew in the city .
then said he unto me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perverseness : for they say , The Lord hath forsaken the earth , and the Lord seeth not .
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will recompense their way upon their head .
and , behold , the man clothed with linen , which had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as thou hast commanded me .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord 's glory .
and the sound of the cherubims ' wings was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh .
and it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man 's hand under their wings .
and when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
and as for their appearances , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel .
when they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place whither the head looked they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
as for the wheels , it was cried unto them in my hearing , O wheel .
and the cherubims were lifted up . this is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar .
and when the cherubims went , the wheels went by them : and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubims .
and the cherubims lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight : when they went out , the wheels also were beside them , and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
this is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar ; and I knew that they were the cherubims .
every one had four faces apiece , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar , their appearances and themselves : they went every one straight forward .
and the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me , and said unto me , Speak ; Thus saith the Lord ; Thus have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
Ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
Ye have feared the sword ; and I will bring a sword upon you , saith the Lord God .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
Ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
this city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
and ye shall know that I am the Lord : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you .
again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
therefore say , Thus saith the Lord God ; I will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
and they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the Lord God .
then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
and the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
the word of the Lord also came unto me , saying ,
son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not ; they have ears to hear , and hear not : for they are a rebellious house .
then shalt thou bring forth THY stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into captivity .
dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
in their sight shalt thou bear it upon THY shoulders , and carry it forth in the twilight : thou shalt cover THY face , that thou see not the ground : for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel .
and I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for captivity , and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand ; I brought it forth in the twilight , and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight .
say , I am your sign : like as I have done , so shall it be done unto them : they shall remove and go into captivity .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
and I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall scatter them among the nations , and disperse them in the countries .
moreover the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
son of man , eat THY bread with quaking , and drink THY water with trembling and with carefulness ;
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be desolate ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel , saying , The days are prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel .
again the word of the Lord came to me , saying ,
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off .
therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord God .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy , and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts , Hear ye the word of the Lord ;
Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
they have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , The Lord saith : and the Lord hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , The Lord saith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ; and there was no peace ; and one built up a wall , and , lo , others daubed it with untempered morter :
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
Lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger , and great hailstones in my fury to consume it .
so will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
likewise , thou son of man , set THY face against the daughters of THY people , which prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy thou against them ,
your kerchiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
therefore ye shall see no more vanity , nor divine divinations : for I will deliver my people out of your hand : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God ; repent , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the Lord have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity : the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him ;
that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , saith the Lord God .
the word of the Lord came again to me , saying ,
if I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts :
or if I bring a sword upon that land , and say , sword , go through the land ; so that I cut off man and beast from it :
though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only shall be delivered themselves .
or if I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast :
though Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , as I live , saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord God .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , What is the vine tree more than any tree , or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire devoureth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hath devoured it , and it is burned ?
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall devour them ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I set my face against them .
again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and say , Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem ; Thy birth and THY nativity is of the land of Canaan ; THY father was an Amorite , and THY mother an Hittite .
and as for THY nativity , in the day thou wast born THY navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of THY person , in the day that thou wast born .
and when I passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , I said unto thee when thou wast in THY blood , Live ; yea , I said unto thee when thou wast in THY blood , Live .
then washed I thee with water ; yea , I throughly washed away THY blood from thee , and I anointed thee with oil .
I clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with badgers ' skin , and I girded thee about with fine linen , and I covered thee with silk .
I decked thee also with ornaments , and I put bracelets upon THY hands , and a chain on THY neck .
and I put a jewel on THY forehead , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
thus wast thou decked with gold and silver ; and THY raiment was of fine linen , and silk , and broidered work ; thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil : and thou wast exceeding beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
and THY renown went forth among the heathen for THY beauty : for it was perfect through my comeliness , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord God .
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and playedst the harlot because of THY renown , and pouredst out THY fornications on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of THY garments thou didst take , and deckedst THY high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
Thou hast also taken THY fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
and tookest THY broidered garments , and coveredst them : and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them .
my meat also which I gave thee , fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith I fed thee , thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour : and thus it was , saith the Lord God .
moreover thou hast taken THY sons and THY daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of THY whoredoms a small matter ,
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and in all thine abominations and THY whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of THY youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in THY blood .
and it came to pass after all THY wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the Lord God ; )
that thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place , and hast made thee an high place in every street .
Thou hast built THY high place at every head of the way , and hast made THY beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened THY feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied THY whoredoms .
Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians THY neighbours , great of flesh ; and hast increased THY whoredoms , to provoke me to anger .
Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians , because thou wast unsatiable ; yea , thou hast played the harlot with them , and yet couldest not be satisfied .
Thou hast moreover multiplied THY fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
they give gifts to all whores : but thou givest THY gifts to all THY lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for THY whoredom .
and the contrary is in thee from other women in THY whoredoms , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms : and in that thou givest a reward , and no reward is given unto thee , therefore thou art contrary .
thus saith the Lord God ; Because THY filthiness was poured out , and THY nakedness discovered through THY whoredoms with THY lovers , and with all the idols of THY abominations , and by the blood of THY children , which thou didst give unto them ;
and I will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down THY high places : they shall strip thee also of THY clothes , and shall take THY fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
they shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee through with their swords .
and they shall burn thine houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women : and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
behold , every one that useth Proverbs shall use this proverb against thee , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
Thou art THY mother 's daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of THY sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
and thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at THY left hand : and THY younger sister , that dwelleth at THY right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all THY ways .
as I live , saith the Lord God , Sodom THY sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and THY daughters .
behold , this was the iniquity of THY sister Sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither hath Samaria committed half of THY sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified THY sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
when I shall bring again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , then will I bring again the captivity of THY captives in the midst of them :
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
when THY sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and THY daughters shall return to your former estate .
nevertheless I will remember my Covenant with thee in the days of THY youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting Covenant .
then thou shalt remember THY ways , and be ashamed , when thou shalt receive THY sisters , thine elder and THY younger : and I will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by THY Covenant .
and I will establish my Covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord :
that thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and never open THY mouth any more because of THY shame , when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord God .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and say , Thus saith the Lord God ; A great eagle with great wings , longwinged , full of feathers , which had divers colours , came unto Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the cedar :
he cropped off the top of his young twigs , and carried it into a land of traffick ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
Yea , behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? shall it not utterly wither , when the east wind toucheth it ? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a Covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his Covenant it might stand .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose Covenant he brake , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the Covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; As I live , surely mine oath that he hath despised , and my Covenant that he hath broken , even it will I recompense upon his own head .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it .
the word of the Lord came unto me again , saying ,
what mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , saith the Lord God , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour 's wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman ,
and hath not oppressed any , but hath restored to the debtor his pledge , hath spoiled none by violence , hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ;
he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
Hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept my judgments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the Lord God .
if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth the like to any one of these things ,
and that doeth not any of those duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains , and defiled his neighbour 's wife ,
Hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination ,
Hath given forth upon usury , and hath taken increase : shall he then live ? he shall not live : he hath done all these abominations ; he shall surely die ; his blood shall be upon him .
now , lo , if he beget a son , that seeth all his father 's sins which he hath done , and considereth , and doeth not such like ,
that hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , hath not defiled his neighbour 's wife ,
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , spoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his iniquity .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
all his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Lord God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth in them ; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die .
again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the Lord God : wherefore turn yourselves , and live ye .
and she brought up one of her whelps : it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the prey ; it devoured men .
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit , and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whelps , and made him a young lion .
and he knew their desolate palaces , and he laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and the fulness thereof , by the noise of his roaring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him : he was taken in their pit .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
THY mother is like a vine in THY blood , planted by the waters : she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
but she was plucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
and now she is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty ground .
and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches , which hath devoured her fruit , so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule . this is a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation .
and it came to pass in the seventh year , in the fifth month , the tenth day of the month , that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord , and sat before me .
son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Are ye come to inquire of me ? as I live , saith the Lord God , I will not be inquired of by you .
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up mine hand unto them , saying , I am the Lord your God ;
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
then said I unto them , cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes , and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt : I am the Lord your God .
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , among whom they were , in whose sight I made myself known unto them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
and I gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
moreover also I gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them .
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight I brought them out .
yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
because they despised my judgments , and walked not in my statutes , but polluted my sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness .
but I said unto their children in the wilderness , Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers , neither observe their judgments , nor defile yourselves with their idols :
I am the Lord your God ; walk in my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ;
and hallow my sabbaths ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that ye may know that I am the Lord your God .
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed my judgments , but had despised my statutes , and had polluted my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good , and judgments whereby they should not live ;
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
then I said unto them , What is the high place whereunto ye go ? and the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out , will I rule over you :
and I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will I plead with you face to face .
like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I plead with you , saith the Lord God .
and I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant :
and I will purge out from among you the rebels , and them that transgress against me : I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord God ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
for in mine holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , saith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel , all of them in the land , serve me : there will I accept them , and there will I require your offerings , and the firstfruits of your oblations , with all your holy things .
I will accept you with your sweet savour , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered ; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O ye house of Israel , saith the Lord God .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set THY face toward the south , and drop THY word toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the south field ;
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and say to the land of Israel , Thus saith the Lord ; behold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
that all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath : it shall not return any more .
again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the Slayer .
cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon THY thigh .
because it is a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ? it shall be no more , saith the Lord God .
go thee one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , whithersoever THY face is set .
I will also smite mine hands together , and I will cause my fury to rest : I the Lord have said it .
the word of the Lord came unto me again , saying ,
also , thou son of man , appoint thee two ways , that the sword of the king of Babylon may come : both twain shall come forth out of one land : and choose thou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
appoint a way , that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites , and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
thus saith the Lord God ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
I will overturn , overturn , overturn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him .
shall I cause it to return into his sheath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of THY nativity .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; THY blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for I the Lord have spoken it .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? yea , thou shalt shew her all her abominations .
then say thou , Thus saith the Lord God , The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and maketh idols against herself to defile herself .
those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mock thee , which art infamous and much vexed .
behold , the princes of Israel , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood .
in thee have they set light by father and mother : in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger : in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood : and in thee they eat upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they commit lewdness .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' nakedness : in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution .
and one hath committed abomination with his neighbour 's wife ; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law ; and another in thee hath humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood ; thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained of THY neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , saith the Lord God .
behold , therefore I have smitten mine hand at THY dishonest gain which thou hast made , and at THY blood which hath been in the midst of thee .
can thine heart endure , or can thine hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with thee ? I the Lord have spoken it , and will do it .
and I will scatter thee among the heathen , and disperse thee in the countries , and will consume THY filthiness out of thee .
and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye are all become dross , behold , therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
Yea , I will gather you , and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof , like a roaring lion ravening the prey ; they have devoured souls ; they have taken the treasure and precious things ; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter , seeing vanity , and divining lies unto them , saying , Thus saith the Lord God , when the Lord hath not spoken .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I recompensed upon their heads , saith the Lord God .
the word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
and they committed whoredoms in Egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
and the names of them were Aholah the elder , and Aholibah her sister : and they were mine , and they bare sons and daughters . thus were their names ; Samaria is Aholah , and Jerusalem Aholibah .
and Aholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians her neighbours ,
thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with all their idols she defiled herself .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , upon whom she doted .
these discovered her nakedness : they took her sons and her daughters , and slew her with the sword : and she became famous among women ; for they had executed judgment upon her .
and when her sister Aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms .
she doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours , captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them desirable young men .
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
and the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
so she discovered her whoredoms , and discovered her nakedness : then my mind was alienated from her , like as my mind was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
for she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of THY youth , in bruising THY teats by the Egyptians for the paps of THY youth .
there , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will raise up THY lovers against thee , from whom THY mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
the Babylonians , and all the Chaldeans , Pekod , and Shoa , and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them : all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
they shall also strip thee out of THY clothes , and take away THY fair jewels .
thus will I make THY lewdness to cease from thee , and THY whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest , into the hand of them from whom THY mind is alienated :
Thou hast walked in the way of THY sister ; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand .
thus saith the Lord God ; Thou shalt drink of THY sister 's cup deep and large : thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision ; it containeth much .
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of THY sister Samaria .
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
the Lord said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah ? yea , declare unto them their abominations ;
that they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands , and with their idols have they committed adultery , and have also caused their sons , whom they bare unto me , to pass for them through the fire , to devour them .
and furthermore , that ye have sent for men to come from far , unto whom a messenger was sent ; and , lo , they came : for whom thou didst wash thyself , paintedst THY eyes , and deckedst thyself with ornaments ,
and satest upon a stately bed , and a table prepared before it , whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil .
then said I unto her that was old in adulteries , Will they now commit whoredoms with her , and she with them ?
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah , the lewd women .
and the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus saith the Lord God ; I will bring up a company upon them , and will give them to be removed and spoiled .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols : and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein .
Wherefore thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose scum is therein , and whose scum is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall up on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance ; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
then set it empty upon the coals thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
she hath wearied herself with lies , and her great scum went not forth out of her : her scum shall be in the fire .
in THY filthiness is lewdness : because I have purged thee , and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from THY filthiness any more , till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee .
also the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall THY tears run down .
Forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on THY shoes upon THY feet , and cover not THY lips , and eat not the bread of men .
so I spake unto the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
and your tires shall be upon your heads , and your shoes upon your feet : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities , and mourn one toward another .
in that day shall THY mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eat THY fruit , and they shall drink THY milk .
and I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
for thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou hast clapped thine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced in heart with all THY despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , Beth @-@ jeshimoth , Baal @-@ meon , and Kiriathaim ,
unto the men of the east with the Ammonites , and will give them in possession , that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations .
thus saith the Lord God ; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and revenged himself upon them ;
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword .
and I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord God .
thus saith the Lord God ; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred ;
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines , and I will cut off the Cherethims , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
and I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem , Aha , she is broken that was the gates of the people : she is turned unto me : I shall be replenished , now she is laid waste :
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I am against thee , O Tyrus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
and they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus , and break down her towers : I will also scrape her dust from her , and make her like the top of a rock .
it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God : and it shall become a spoil to the nations .
and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , a king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and companies , and much people .
he shall slay with the sword THY daughters in the field : and he shall make a Fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the buckler against thee .
and he shall set engines of war against THY walls , and with his axes he shall break down THY towers .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all THY streets : he shall slay THY people by the sword , and THY strong garrisons shall go down to the ground .
and they shall make a spoil of THY riches , and make a prey of THY merchandise : and they shall break down THY walls , and destroy THY pleasant houses : and they shall lay THY stones and THY timber and THY dust in the midst of the water .
and I will cause the noise of THY songs to cease ; and the sound of THY harps shall be no more heard .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the Lord have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus ; shall not the isles shake at the sound of THY fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay away their robes , and put off their broidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tremble at every moment , and be astonished at thee .
now shall the isles tremble in the day of THY fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at THY departure .
for thus saith the Lord God ; When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
the word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
and say unto Tyrus , O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many isles , Thus saith the Lord God ; O Tyrus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
THY borders are in the midst of the seas , THY builders have perfected THY beauty .
they have made all THY ship boards of fir trees of Senir : they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee .
of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the Ashurites have made THY benches of Ivory , brought out of the isles of Chittim .
fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be THY sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
the inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were THY mariners : THY wise men , O Tyrus , that were in thee , were THY pilots .
the ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee THY calkers : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy THY merchandise .
they of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , THY men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth THY comeliness .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon THY walls round about , and the Gammadims were in THY towers : they hanged their shields upon THY walls round about ; they have made THY beauty perfect .
Javan , Tubal , and Meshech , they were THY merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in THY market .
the men of Dedan were THY merchants ; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand : they brought thee for a present horns of Ivory and ebony .
Syria was THY merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of THY making : they occupied in THY fairs with emeralds , purple , and broidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and agate .
Judah , and the land of Israel , they were THY merchants : they traded in THY market wheat of Minnith , and Pannag , and honey , and oil , and balm .
Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they occupied with thee in lambs , and rams , and goats : in these were they THY merchants .
the merchants of Sheba and Raamah , they were THY merchants : they occupied in THY fairs with chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were THY merchants in all sorts of things , in blue clothes , and broidered work , and in chests of rich apparel , bound with cords , and made of cedar , among THY merchandise .
the ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in THY market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
THY rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
the suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of THY pilots .
and all that handle the oar , the mariners , and all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust upon their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing .
and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and lament over thee , saying , What city is like Tyrus , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
when THY wares went forth out of the seas , thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of THY riches and of THY merchandise .
in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters THY merchandise and all THY company in the midst of thee shall fall .
all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee , and their kings shall be sore afraid , they shall be troubled in their countenance .
the word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
behold , thou art wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from thee :
with THY wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and silver into THY treasures :
by THY great wisdom and by THY traffick hast thou increased THY riches , and thine heart is lifted up because of THY riches :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of THY wisdom , and they shall defile THY brightness .
they shall bring thee down to the pit , and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas .
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that slayeth thee .
Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , saith the Lord God .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God ; Thou sealest up the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty .
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
Thou wast perfect in THY ways from the day that thou wast created , till iniquity was found in thee .
Thine heart was lifted up because of THY beauty , thou hast corrupted THY wisdom by reason of THY brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
for I will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel , nor any grieving Thorn of all that are round about them , that despised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord God .
thus saith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen , then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set THY face against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and prophesy against him , and against all Egypt :
but I will put hooks in THY jaws , and I will cause the fish of THY rivers to stick unto THY scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of THY rivers , and all the fish of THY rivers shall stick unto THY scales .
and I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of THY rivers : thou shalt fall upon the open fields ; thou shalt not be brought together , nor gathered : I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven .
and all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord , because they have been a staff of Reed to the house of Israel .
when they took hold of thee by THY hand , thou didst break , and rend all their shoulder : and when they leaned upon thee , thou brakest , and madest all their loins to be at a stand .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will bring a sword upon thee , and cut off man and beast out of thee .
and the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the Lord : because he hath said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
behold , therefore I am against thee , and against THY rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of beast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
and I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years : and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
yet thus saith the Lord God ; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered :
and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros , into the land of their habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall take her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it , because they wrought for me , saith the Lord God .
in that day will I cause the Horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
for the day is near , even the day of the Lord is near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
and the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and Libya , and Lydia , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
thus saith the Lord ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the Lord God .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
thus saith the Lord God ; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
and I will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked : and I will make the land waste , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I the Lord have spoken it .
thus saith the Lord God ; I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
and I will make Pathros desolate , and will set fire in Zoan , and will execute judgments in No .
and I will pour my fury upon sin , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
and I will set fire in Egypt : sin shall have great pain , and No shall be rent asunder , and Noph shall have distresses daily .
the young men of Aven and of Pi @-@ beseth shall fall by the sword : and these cities shall go into captivity .
at Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened , when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt : and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
thus will I execute judgments in Egypt : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first month , in the seventh day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be healed , to put a roller to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
and I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but I will break Pharaoh 's arms , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
the waters made him great , the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants , and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field .
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches : for his root was by great waters .
I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied him .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain , and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches :
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
thus saith the Lord God ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
then will I leave thee upon the land , I will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
and I will lay THY flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with THY height .
I will also water with THY blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of thee .
and when I shall put thee out , I will cover the heaven , and make the stars thereof dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light .
for thus saith the Lord God ; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee .
by the swords of the mighty will I cause THY multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations , all of them : and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
then will I make their waters deep , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the Lord God .
when I shall make the land of Egypt desolate , and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full , when I shall smite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the Lord .
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her : the daughters of the nations shall lament her : they shall lament for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , saith the Lord God .
it came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the nether parts of the earth , with them that go down into the pit .
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword : draw her and all her multitudes .
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him : they are gone down , they lie uncircumcised , slain by the sword .
Asshur is there and all her company : his graves are about him : all of them slain , fallen by the sword :
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them slain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
Yea , thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword .
there is Edom , her kings , and all her princes , which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword : they shall lie with the uncircumcised , and with them that go down to the pit .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword , saith the Lord God .
for I have caused my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord God .
again the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , speak to the children of THY people , and say unto them , When I bring the sword upon a land , if the people of the land take a man of their coasts , and set him for their watchman :
if when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning ; if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
he heard the sound of the trumpet , and took not warning ; his blood shall be upon him . but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
when I say unto the wicked , O wicked man , thou shalt surely die ; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered THY soul .
again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he had robbed , walk in the statutes of life , without committing iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the children of THY people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
but if the wicked turn from his wickedness , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten .
then the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
Wherefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; Ye eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
Ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour 's wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
for I will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed .
and , lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear THY words , but they do them not .
and when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds ; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves ! should not the shepherds feed the flocks ?
Ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool , ye kill them that are fed : but ye feed not the flock .
and they were scattered , because there is no shepherd : and they became meat to all the beasts of the field , when they were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and upon every high hill : yea , my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth , and none did search or seek after them .
as I live , saith the Lord God , surely because my flock became a prey , and my flock became meat to every beast of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flock ;
for thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I , even I , will both search my sheep , and seek them out .
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will feed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord God .
I will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but I will destroy the fat and the strong ; I will feed them with judgment .
and as for you , O my flock , thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I judge between cattle and cattle , between the rams and the he goats .
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture , but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures ? and to have drunk of the deep waters , but ye must foul the residue with your feet ?
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus saith the Lord God unto them ; behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder , and pushed all the diseased with your horns , till ye have scattered them abroad ;
therefore will I save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and I will judge between cattle and cattle .
and I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
and I will make with them a Covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
and I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
and I will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord God .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
and say unto it , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
I will lay THY cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
because thou hast had a perpetual hatred , and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity , in the time that their iniquity had an end :
therefore , as I live , saith the Lord God , I will prepare thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hated blood , even blood shall pursue thee .
thus will I make mount Seir most desolate , and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth .
and I will fill his mountains with his slain men : in THY hills , and in THY valleys , and in all THY rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
I will make thee perpetual desolations , and THY cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all THY blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard them .
also , thou son of man , prophesy unto the mountains of Israel , and say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord :
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; I have lifted up mine hand , surely the heathen that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
but ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people of Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
for , behold , I am for you , and I will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown :
and I will multiply men upon you , all the house of Israel , even all of it : and the cities shall be inhabited , and the wastes shall be builded :
Yea , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause THY nations to fall any more , saith the Lord God .
moreover the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it :
and I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
and when they entered unto the heathen , whither they went , they profaned my holy name , when they said to them , These are the people of the Lord , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had pity for mine holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen , whither they went .
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God ; I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
for I will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
a new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
and I will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments , and do them .
and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
and I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord God , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , O house of Israel .
thus saith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
and the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
and they shall say , This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced , and are inhabited .
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : I the Lord have spoken it , and I will do it .
thus saith the Lord God ; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel , to do it for them ; I will increase them with men like a flock .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
the hand of the Lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones ,
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry .
thus saith the Lord God unto these bones ; behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and I will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
so I prophesied as I was commanded : and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold a shaking , and the bones came together , bone to his bone .
and when I beheld , lo , the sinews and the flesh came up upon them , and the skin covered them above : but there was no breath in them .
then he said unto me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried , and our hope is lost : we are cut off for our parts .
therefore prophesy and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
and ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it , and performed it , saith the Lord .
the word of the Lord came again unto me , saying ,
moreover , thou son of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel his companions : then take another stick , and write upon it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim , and for all the house of Israel his companions :
and when the children of THY people shall speak unto thee , saying , Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these ?
and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes .
and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen , whither they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all :
neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols , nor with their detestable things , nor with any of their transgressions : but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces , wherein they have sinned , and will cleanse them : so shall they be my people , and I will be their God .
and David my servant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my judgments , and observe my statutes , and do them .
and they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my servant David shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a Covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting Covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore .
my tabernacle also shall be with them : yea , I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
and the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set THY face against Gog , the land of Magog , the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal , and prophesy against him ,
be thou prepared , and prepare for thyself , thou , and all THY company that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all THY bands , and many people with thee .
thus saith the Lord God ; It shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall things come into THY mind , and thou shalt think an evil thought :
and thou shalt come from THY place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord God , that my fury shall come up in my face .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the Lord God : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
and I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an overflowing rain , and great hailstones , fire , and brimstone .
thus will I magnify myself , and sanctify myself ; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations , and they shall know that I am the Lord .
therefore , thou son of man , prophesy against Gog , and say , Thus saith the Lord God ; behold , I am against thee , O Gog , the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal :
and I will turn thee back , and leave but the sixth part of thee , and will cause thee to come up from the north parts , and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel :
and I will smite THY bow out of THY left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of THY right hand .
Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou , and all THY bands , and the people that is with thee : I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the beasts of the field to be devoured .
and I will send a fire on Magog , and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles : and they shall know that I am the Lord .
so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more : and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , the Holy One in Israel .
behold , it is come , and it is done , saith the Lord God ; this is the day whereof I have spoken .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall burn the weapons with fire : and they shall spoil those that spoiled them , and rob those that robbed them , saith the Lord God .
and seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them , that they may cleanse the land .
Yea , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord God .
and the passengers that pass through the land , when any seeth a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon @-@ gog .
and also the name of the city shall be Hamonah . thus shall they cleanse the land .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the Lord God .
and I will set my glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed , and my hand that I have laid upon them .
so the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward .
and the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity : because they trespassed against me , therefore hid I my face from them , and gave them into the hand of their enemies : so fell they all by the sword .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them , and hid my face from them .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel , and will be Jealous for my holy name ;
after that they have borne their shame , and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me , when they dwelt safely in their land , and none made them afraid .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the Lord their God , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
neither will I hide my face any more from them : for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel , saith the Lord God .
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me , and brought me thither .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and he brought me thither , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring Reed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one Reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one Reed broad .
and every little chamber was one Reed long , and one Reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one Reed .
he measured also the porch of the gate within , one Reed .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
and he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits .
the space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side , and the space was one cubit on that side : and the little chambers were six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
he made also posts of threescore cubits , even unto the post of the court round about the gate .
and from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
and the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
and the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north , he measured the length thereof , and the breadth thereof .
and the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate : the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and their windows , and their arches , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof were before them .
and the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits .
after that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
and he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures .
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , were according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
the little chambers thereof , the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , and the windows to it round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
and at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew their sacrifices .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and he said unto me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi , which come near to the Lord to minister unto him .
so he measured the court , an hundred cubits long , and an hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar that was before the house .
and he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
so he measured the length thereof , twenty cubits ; and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said unto me , This is the most holy place .
after he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
I saw also the height of the house round about : the foundations of the side chambers were a full Reed of six great cubits .
the thickness of the wall , which was for the side chamber without , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within .
and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
so he measured the house , an hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the walls thereof , an hundred cubits long ;
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , an hundred cubits .
and he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cubits , with the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
the door posts , and the narrow windows , and the galleries round about on their three stories , over against the door , cieled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ;
to that above the door , even unto the inner house , and without , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
and it was made with cherubims and palm trees , so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub ; and every cherub had two faces ;
so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
from the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made , and on the wall of the temple .
the posts of the temple were squared , and the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
the altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof , and the length thereof , and the walls thereof , were of wood : and he said unto me , This is the table that is before the Lord .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court , and over against the pavement which was for the utter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
and before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors toward the north .
now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the building .
for they were in three stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground .
and the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cubits .
the chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it round about .
he measured the east side with the measuring Reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring Reed round about .
he measured the north side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring Reed round about .
he measured the south side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring Reed .
he turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring Reed .
afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east :
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell upon my face .
and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house .
and I heard him speaking unto me out of the house ; and the man stood by me .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
Thou son of man , shew the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities : and let them measure the pattern .
this is the law of the house ; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits , and the breadth one cubit .
and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about ; and his stairs shall look toward the east .
and he said unto me , Son of man , thus saith the Lord God ; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
and thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok , which approach unto me , to minister unto me , saith the Lord God , a young bullock for a sin offering .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they did cleanse it with the bullock .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering : they shall also prepare a young bullock , and a ram out of the flock , without blemish .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , saith the Lord God .
then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east ; and it was shut .
then said the Lord unto me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the Lord , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face .
and thou shalt say to the rebellious , even to the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord God ; O ye house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers , uncircumcised in heart , and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to pollute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my Covenant because of all your abominations .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
thus saith the Lord God ; No stranger , uncircumcised in heart , nor uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any stranger that is among the children of Israel .
and the Levites that are gone away far from me , when Israel went astray , which went astray away from me after their idols ; they shall even bear their iniquity .
because they ministered unto them before their idols , and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity ; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them , saith the Lord God , and they shall bear their iniquity .
and they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
but I will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them , whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat .
neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only poll their heads .
neither shall any priest drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hath had no husband , they may defile themselves .
and after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , saith the Lord God .
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance : I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
they shall eat the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs .
and the first of all the firstfruits of all things , and every oblation of all , of every sort of your oblations , shall be the priest 's : ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
moreover , when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord , an holy portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds , and the breadth shall be ten thousand . this shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about .
of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length , with five hundred in breadth , square round about ; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary , which shall come near to minister unto the Lord : and it shall be a place for their houses , and an holy place for the sanctuary .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the oblation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
Ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath . I
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
this is the oblation that ye shall offer ; the sixth part of an ephah of an Homer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an Homer of barley :
concerning the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the Cor , which is an Homer of ten baths ; for ten baths are an Homer :
all the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel .
thus saith the Lord God ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary :
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar , and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court .
and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth , and for him that is simple : so shall ye reconcile the house .
in the first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and an hin of oil for an ephah .
in the seventh month , in the fifteenth day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
thus saith the Lord God ; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sabbath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons .
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
and the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram , and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give , and an hin of oil to an ephah .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and he shall prepare a meat offering , an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto , and an hin of oil to an ephah .
and when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
and the prince in the midst of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
and in the feast and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock , and ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and an hin of oil to an ephah .
Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish : thou shalt prepare it every morning .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meat offering , and the oil , every morning for a continual burnt offering .
moreover the prince shall not take of the people 's inheritance by oppression , to thrust them out of their possession ; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession : that my people be not scattered every man from his possession .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and , behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
in the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad : these four corners were of one measure .
and there was a row of building round about in them , round about them four , and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about .
then said he unto me , These are the places of them that boil , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ancles .
again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
afterward he measured a thousand ; and it was a river that I could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed over .
and he said unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen this ? then he brought me , and caused me to return to the brink of the river .
now when I had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
and it shall come to pass , that the fishers shall stand upon it from En @-@ gedi even unto En @-@ eglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth nets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed ; they shall be given to salt .
thus saith the Lord God ; This shall be the border , whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph shall have two portions .
and ye shall inherit it , one as well as another : concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers : and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of Hethlon , as men go to Zedad ;
Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazar @-@ hatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
and the south side southward , from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh , the river to the great sea . and this is the south side southward .
the west side also shall be the great sea from the border , till a man come over against Hamath . this is the west side .
and it shall come to pass , that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth , there shall ye give him his inheritance , saith the Lord God .
and by the border of Asher , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for Naphtali .
the oblation that ye shall offer unto the Lord shall be of five and twenty thousand in length , and of ten thousand in breadth .
it shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok ; which have kept my charge , which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
and over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
and these shall be the measures thereof ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
and the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand westward : and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion ; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city .
and they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel .
moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
and by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh , and to the river toward the great sea .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their portions , saith the Lord God .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Simeon , one gate of Issachar , one gate of Zebulun .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred , with their three gates ; one gate of Gad , one gate of Asher , one gate of Naphtali .
in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem , and besieged it .
and the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of God : which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah , of Abed @-@ nego .
now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs .
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou seest , deal with THY servants .
and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
as for these four children , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
and the king communed with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : therefore stood they before the king .
and in all matters of wisdom and understanding , that the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm .
and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
the king answered and said to the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
but if ye shew the dream , and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour : therefore shew me the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
the king answered and said , I know of certainty that ye would gain the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain .
then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon :
he answered and said to Arioch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so hasty from the king ? then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions :
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision . then Daniel blessed the God of heaven .
and he changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding :
he revealeth the deep and secret things : he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king 's matter .
therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus unto him ; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will shew unto the king the interpretation .
then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him , I have found a man of the captives of Judah , that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
the king answered and said to Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen , and the interpretation thereof ?
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . THY dream , and the visions of THY head upon THY bed , are these ;
as for thee , O king , THY thoughts came into THY mind upon THY bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
Thou , O king , sawest , and behold a great image . this great image , whose brightness was excellent , stood before thee ; and the form thereof was terrible .
this image 's head was of fine gold , his breast and his arms of silver , his belly and his thighs of brass ,
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands , which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay , and brake them to pieces .
Thou , O king , art a king of kings : for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom , power , and strength , and glory .
and wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all . Thou art this head of gold .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men : but they shall not cleave one to another , even as iron is not mixed with clay .
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him .
the king answered unto Daniel , and said , Of a truth it is , that your God is a God of gods , and a Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , seeing thou couldest reveal this secret .
then the king made Daniel a great man , and gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon , and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon .
then Daniel requested of the king , and he set Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , over the affairs of the province of Babylon : but Daniel sat in the gate of the king .
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof six cubits : he set it up in the plain of Dura , in the province of Babylon .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellers , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up :
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
therefore at that time , when all the people heard the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and all kinds of musick , all the people , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and accused the Jews .
then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego . then they brought these men before the king .
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , answered and said to the king , O Nebuchadnezzar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
if it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of thine hand , O king .
but if not , be it known unto thee , O king , that we will not serve THY gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego : therefore he spake , and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated .
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
then these men were bound in their coats , their hosen , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego .
and these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
how great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth :
the leaves thereof were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all : the beasts of the field had shadow under it , and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof , and all flesh was fed of it .
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven ;
he cried aloud , and said thus , Hew down the tree , and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves , and scatter his fruit : let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from his branches :
nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth :
let his heart be changed from man 's , and let a beast 's heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that thou sawest , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached unto the heaven , and the sight thereof to all the earth ;
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation :
it is thou , O king , that art grown and become strong : for THY greatness is grown , and reacheth unto heaven , and THY dominion to the end of the earth .
this is the interpretation , O king , and this is the decree of the most High , which is come upon my lord the king :
and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots ; THY kingdom shall be sure unto thee , after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule .
at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon .
the king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , saying , O king Nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken ; The kingdom is departed from thee .
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords , and drank wine before the thousand .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , drank in them .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
then came in all the king 's wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . and the king spake and said unto Daniel , Art thou that Daniel , which art of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Jewry ?
I have even heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
and now the wise men , the astrologers , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known unto me the interpretation thereof : but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing :
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let THY gifts be to thyself , and give THY rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
O thou king , the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar THY father a kingdom , and majesty , and glory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then was the part of the hand sent from him ; and this writing was written .
Peres ; Thy kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
then commanded Belshazzar , and they clothed Daniel with scarlet , and put a chain of gold about his neck , and made a proclamation concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
and Darius the median took the kingdom , being about threescore and two years old .
it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes , which should be over the whole kingdom ;
and over these three presidents ; of whom Daniel was first : that the princes might give accounts unto them , and the king should have no damage .
then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
then said these men , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , which is of the children of the captivity of Judah , regardeth not thee , O king , nor the decree that thou hast signed , but maketh his petition three times a day .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . now the king spake and said unto Daniel , Thy God whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musick brought before him : and his sleep went from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste unto the den of lions .
my God hath sent his angel , and hath shut the lions ' mouths , that they have not hurt me : forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me ; and also before thee , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
I make a decree , That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , and stedfast for ever , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed , and his dominion shall be even unto the end .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
Daniel spake and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea .
and four great beasts came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
after this I beheld , and lo another , like a Leopard , which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl ; the beast had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the Horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
as concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time .
I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
these great beasts , which are four , are four kings , which shall arise out of the earth .
but the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
I beheld , and the same Horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ;
until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
but the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me , even unto me Daniel , after that which appeared unto me at the first .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and as I was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat had a notable Horn between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
therefore the he goat waxed very great : and when he was strong , the great Horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
and out of one of them came forth a little Horn , which waxed exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleasant land .
and it waxed great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground , and stamped upon them .
Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised , and prospered .
and it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
and I heard a man 's voice between the banks of Ulai , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
so he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said unto me , understand , O son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me upright .
the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia .
and the rough goat is the king of Grecia : and the great Horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
now that being broken , whereas four stood up for it , four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not in his power .
and in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors are come to the full , a king of fierce countenance , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
and his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
and I Daniel fainted , and was sick certain days ; afterward I rose up , and did the king 's business ; and I was astonished at the vision , but none understood it .
and I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and supplication , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes :
we have sinned , and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even by departing from THY precepts and from THY judgments :
neither have we hearkened unto THY servants the prophets , which spake in THY name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
O Lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against thee .
neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil is come upon us : yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God , that we might turn from our iniquities , and understand THY truth .
therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought THY people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of THY servant , and his supplications , and cause THY face to shine upon THY sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
O my God , incline thine ear , and hear ; open thine eyes , and behold our desolations , and the city which is called by THY name : for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses , but for THY great mercies .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive ; O Lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , O my God : for THY city and THY people are called by THY name .
and whiles I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
Yea , whiles I was speaking in prayer , even the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
I ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth , neither did I anoint myself at all , till three whole weeks were fulfilled .
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ;
then I lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and behold a certain man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz :
and I Daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with me saw not the vision ; but a great quaking fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
and , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall THY people in the latter days : for yet the vision is for many days .
and when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me ,
then said he , Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee ? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia : and when I am gone forth , lo , the prince of Grecia shall come .
but I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth : and there is none that holdeth with me in these things , but Michael your prince .
and a mighty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate , which shall come with an army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prevail :
and shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods , with their princes , and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom , and shall return into his own land .
and the king of the south shall be moved with choler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be given into his hand .
and when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
for the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robbers of THY people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him : and he shall stand in the glorious land , which by his hand shall be consumed .
after this shall he turn his face unto the isles , and shall take many : but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him .
then he shall turn his face toward the Fort of his own land : but he shall stumble and fall , and not be found .
then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom : but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
and in his estate shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom : but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him , and shall be broken ; yea , also the prince of the Covenant .
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
Yea , they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow : and many shall fall down slain .
and both these kings ' hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy Covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
for the ships of Chittim shall come against him : therefore he shall be grieved , and return , and have indignation against the holy Covenant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy Covenant .
and arms shall stand on his part , and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate .
and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
and they that understand among the people shall instruct many : yet they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil , many days .
now when they shall fall , they shall be holpen with a little help : but many shall cleave to them with flatteries .
neither shall he regard the God of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god : for he shall magnify himself above all .
but in his estate shall he honour the God of forces : and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt : and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and he said , Go THY way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
many shall be purified , and made white , and tried ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
and the Lord said unto him , Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel .
and it shall come to pass at that day , that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel .
and she conceived again , and bare a daughter . and God said unto him , Call her name Lo @-@ ruhamah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
but I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by the Lord their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen .
yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which cannot be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people , there it shall be said unto them , Ye are the sons of the living God .
then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of Jezreel .
plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
Lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
and I will not have mercy upon her children ; for they be the children of whoredoms .
therefore , behold , I will hedge up THY way with thorns , and make a wall , that she shall not find her paths .
for she did not know that I gave her corn , and wine , and oil , and multiplied her silver and gold , which they prepared for Baal .
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
and now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and none shall deliver her out of mine hand .
I will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast days , her new moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn feasts .
and I will destroy her vines and her fig trees , whereof she hath said , These are my rewards that my lovers have given me : and I will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them .
and I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the Lord .
therefore , behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak comfortably unto her .
and I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
for I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be remembered by their name .
and I will betroth thee unto me for ever ; yea , I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness , and in judgment , and in lovingkindness , and in mercies .
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness : and thou shalt know the Lord .
and it shall come to pass in that day , I will hear , saith the Lord , I will hear the heavens , and they shall hear the earth ;
so I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver , and for an Homer of barley , and an half Homer of barley :
and I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim :
afterward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the Lord their God , and David their king ; and shall fear the Lord and his Goodness in the latter days .
hear the word of the Lord , ye children of Israel : for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the fowls of heaven ; yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night , and I will destroy THY mother .
and there shall be , like people , like priest : and I will punish them for their ways , and reward them their doings .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor your spouses when they commit adultery : for themselves are separated with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
their drink is sour : they have committed whoredom continually : her rulers with shame do love , Give ye .
the wind hath bound her up in her wings , and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices .
and the revolters are profound to make slaughter , though I have been a rebuker of them all .
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the Lord .
and the pride of Israel doth testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity ; Judah also shall fall with them .
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord ; but they shall not find him ; he hath withdrawn himself from them .
blow ye the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah : cry aloud at Beth @-@ aven , after thee , O Benjamin .
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be .
the princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
when Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to king Jareb : yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of your wound .
for I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Judah : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
come , and let us return unto the Lord : for he hath torn , and he will heal us ; he hath smitten , and he will bind us up .
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
O Ephraim , what shall I do unto thee ? O Judah , what shall I do unto thee ? for your Goodness is as a morning cloud , and as the early dew it goeth away .
therefore have I hewed them by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of my mouth : and THY judgments are as the light that goeth forth .
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity , and is polluted with blood .
and as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests murder in the way by consent : for they commit lewdness .
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel : there is the whoredom of Ephraim , Israel is defiled .
when I would have healed Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered , and the wickedness of Samaria : for they commit falsehood ; and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robbers spoileth without .
and they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
they are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the Baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough , until it be leavened .
in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scorners .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their Baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
they are all hot as an oven , and have devoured their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
Ephraim , he hath mixed himself among the people ; Ephraim is a cake not turned .
Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not .
and the pride of Israel testifieth to his face : and they do not return to the Lord their God , nor seek him for all this .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their Congregation hath heard .
Woe unto them ! for they have fled from me : destruction unto them ! because they have transgressed against me : though I have redeemed them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
and they have not cried unto me with their heart , when they howled upon their beds : they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against me .
set the trumpet to THY mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the Lord , because they have transgressed my Covenant , and trespassed against my law .
Israel hath cast off the thing that is good : the enemy shall pursue him .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
THY calf , O Samaria , hath cast thee off ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ERE they attain to innocency ?
for from Israel was it also : the workman made it ; therefore it is not God : but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces .
for they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it hath no stalk : the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the strangers shall swallow it up .
Israel is swallowed up : now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure .
for they are gone up to Assyria , a wild ass alone by himself : Ephraim hath hired lovers .
Yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
for Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
rejoice not , O Israel , for joy , as other people : for thou hast gone a whoring from THY God , thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor .
they shall not dwell in the Lord 's land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria .
what will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of the Lord ?
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
the watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah : therefore he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
as for Ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird , from the birth , and from the womb , and from the conception .
though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I depart from them !
all their wickedness is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their princes are revolters .
Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
my God will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him : and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
Israel is an empty vine , he bringeth forth fruit unto himself : according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars ; according to the Goodness of his land they have made goodly images .
their heart is divided ; now shall they be found faulty : he shall break down their altars , he shall spoil their images .
it shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb : Ephraim shall receive shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
it is in my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
and Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught , and loveth to tread out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make Ephraim to ride ; Judah shall plow , and Jacob shall break his clods .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up your fallow ground : for it is time to seek the Lord , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
Ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in THY way , in the multitude of THY mighty men .
therefore shall a tumult arise among THY people , and all THY fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth @-@ arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
when Israel was a child , then I loved him , and called my son out of Egypt .
as they called them , so they went from them : they sacrificed unto Baalim , and burned incense to Graven images .
I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat unto them .
he shall not return into the land of Egypt , but the Assyrian shall be his king , because they refused to return .
and the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
and my people are bent to backsliding from me : though they called them to the most High , none at all would exalt him .
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger , I will not return to destroy Ephraim : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the midst of thee : and I will not enter into the city .
they shall walk after the Lord : he shall roar like a lion : when he shall roar , then the children shall tremble from the west .
they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria : and I will place them in their houses , saith the Lord .
Ephraim feedeth on wind , and followeth after the east wind : he daily increaseth lies and desolation ; and they do make a Covenant with the Assyrians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
the Lord hath also a controversy with Judah , and will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will he recompense him .
he took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God :
he is a merchant , the balances of deceit are in his hand : he loveth to oppress .
and I that am the Lord THY God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
I have also spoken by the prophets , and I have multiplied visions , and used similitudes , by the ministry of the prophets .
is there iniquity in Gilead ? surely they are vanity : they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields .
and Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
and by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him .
when Ephraim spake trembling , he exalted himself in Israel ; but when he offended in Baal , he died .
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor , and as the smoke out of the chimney .
yet I am the Lord THY God from the land of Egypt , and thou shalt know no god but me : for there is no saviour beside me .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted ; therefore have they forgotten me .
I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .
I will be THY king : where is any other that may save thee in all THY cities ? and THY judges of whom thou saidst , Give me a king and princes ?
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him : he is an unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
Samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
O Israel , return unto the Lord THY God ; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity .
Asshur shall not save us ; we will not ride upon horses : neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , Ye are our gods : for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy .
I will be as the dew unto Israel : he shall grow as the Lily , and cast forth his roots as Lebanon .
his branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive tree , and his smell as Lebanon .
they that dwell under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the corn , and grow as the vine : the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon .
Ephraim shall say , What have I to do any more with idols ? I have heard him , and observed him : I am like a green fir tree . from me is THY fruit found .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? prudent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the Lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the transgressors shall fall therein .
the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel .
hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . Hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten .
awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
he hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord ; the priests , the Lord 's ministers , mourn .
the field is wasted , the land mourneth ; for the corn is wasted : the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
the vine is dried up , and the fig tree languisheth ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all the trees of the field , are withered : because joy is withered away from the sons of men .
Sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God , and cry unto the Lord ,
Alas for the day ! for the day of the Lord is at hand , and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come .
is not the meat cut off before our eyes , yea , joy and gladness from the house of our God ?
the seed is rotten under their clods , the garners are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the corn is withered .
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
O Lord , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
blow ye the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land tremble : for the day of the Lord cometh , for it is nigh at hand ;
a fire devoureth before them ; and behind them a flame burneth : the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape them .
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horsemen , so shall they run .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
they shall run to and fro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall climb up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief .
the earth shall quake before them ; the heavens shall tremble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their shining :
and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
therefore also now , saith the Lord , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning :
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the Lord your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
who knoweth if he will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind him ; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God ?
gather the people , sanctify the Congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts : let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
then will the Lord be Jealous for his land , and pity his people .
Yea , the Lord will answer and say unto his people , behold , I will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith : and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen :
be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength .
and the floors shall be full of wheat , and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil .
and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the Lord your God , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the Lord your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions :
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit .
and I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come .
for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem ,
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat , and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
and they have cast lots for my people ; and have given a boy for an harlot , and sold a girl for wine , that they might drink .
Yea , and what have ye to do with me , O Tyre , and Zidon , and all the coasts of Palestine ? will ye render me a recompence ? and if ye recompence me , swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head ;
because ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things :
the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
behold , I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will return your recompence upon your own head :
and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a people far off : for the Lord hath spoken it .
proclaim ye this among the Gentiles ; Prepare war , wake up the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up :
assemble yourselves , and come , all ye heathen , and gather yourselves together round about : thither cause THY mighty ones to come down , O Lord .
let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about .
put ye in the sickle , for the harvest is ripe : come , get you down ; for the press is full , the fats overflow ; for their wickedness is great .
multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision : for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon shall be darkened , and the stars shall withdraw their shining .
the Lord also shall roar out of Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the Lord will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
so shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion , my holy mountain : then shall Jerusalem be holy , and there shall no strangers pass through her any more .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hills shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters , and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord , and shall water the valley of Shittim .
Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
for I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed : for the Lord dwelleth in Zion .
and he said , The Lord will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of Carmel shall wither .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Damascus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron :
but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael , which shall devour the palaces of Ben @-@ hadad .
I will break also the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven , and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden : and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to Edom :
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall devour the palaces thereof :
and I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon , and I will turn mine hand against Ekron : and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish , saith the Lord God .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Tyrus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly Covenant :
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead , that they might enlarge their border :
but I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind :
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Moab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime :
but I will send a fire upon Moab , and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth : and Moab shall die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet :
and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Judah , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have despised the law of the Lord , and have not kept his commandments , and their lies caused them to err , after the which their fathers have walked :
thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar , and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god .
yet destroyed I the Amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
and I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazarites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? saith the Lord .
therefore the flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the mighty deliver himself :
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
will a lion roar in the forest , when he hath no prey ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have taken nothing at all ?
shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the Lord hath not done it ?
the lion hath roared , who will not fear ? the Lord God hath spoken , who can but prophesy ?
publish in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria , and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
therefore thus saith the Lord God ; An adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down THY strength from thee , and THY palaces shall be spoiled .
that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and I will smite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of Ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith the Lord .
the Lord God hath sworn by his holiness , that , lo , the days shall come upon you , that he will take you away with hooks , and your posterity with fishhooks .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , saith the Lord .
and offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving with leaven , and proclaim and publish the free offerings : for this liketh you , O ye children of Israel , saith the Lord God .
and I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities , and want of bread in all your places : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the Lord .
and also I have withholden the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the harvest : and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was rained upon , and the piece whereupon it rained not withered .
so two or three cities wandered unto one city , to drink water ; but they were not satisfied : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the Lord .
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew : when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased , the palmerworm devoured them : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the Lord .
therefore thus will I do unto thee , O Israel : and because I will do this unto thee , prepare to meet THY God , O Israel .
hear ye this word which I take up against you , even a lamentation , O house of Israel .
the virgin of Israel is fallen ; she shall no more rise : she is forsaken upon her land ; there is none to raise her up .
for thus saith the Lord God ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
seek the Lord , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in Bethel .
that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong , so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress .
they hate him that rebuketh in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor , and ye take from him burdens of wheat : ye have built houses of hewn stone , but ye shall not dwell in them ; ye have planted pleasant vineyards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
for I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
seek good , and not evil , that ye may live : and so the Lord , the God of hosts , shall be with you , as ye have spoken .
hate the evil , and love the good , and establish judgment in the gate : it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph .
Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord ! to what end is it for you ? the day of the Lord is darkness , and not light .
as if a man did flee from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house , and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of THY songs ; for I will not hear the melody of THY viols .
Woe to them that are at ease in Zion , and trust in the mountain of Samaria , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel came !
pass ye unto Calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great : then go down to Gath of the Philistines : be they better than these kingdoms ? or their border greater than your border ?
Ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that lie upon beds of Ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
that chant to the sound of the viol , and invent to themselves instruments of musick , like David ;
that drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief ointments : but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive , and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , behold , the Lord commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
shall horses run upon the rock ? will one plow there with oxen ? for ye have turned judgment into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock :
thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me ; and , behold , he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king 's mowings .
thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me : and , behold , the Lord God called to contend by fire , and it devoured the great deep , and did eat up a part .
then said I , O Lord God , cease , I beseech thee : by whom shall Jacob arise ? for he is small .
and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate , and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword .
then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
but prophesy not again any more at Bethel : for it is the king 's chapel , and it is the king 's court .
then answered Amos , and said to Amaziah , I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was an herdman , and a gatherer of sycomore fruit :
and the Lord took me as I followed the flock , and the Lord said unto me , Go , prophesy unto my people Israel .
now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord : Thou sayest , Prophesy not against Israel , and drop not THY word against the house of Isaac .
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , saith the Lord God : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
hear this , O ye that swallow up the needy , even to make the poor of the land to fail ,
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ; yea , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord God , that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the earth in the clear day :
behold , the days come , saith the Lord God , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord :
and they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord , and shall not find it .
though they dig into hell , thence shall mine hand take them ; though they climb up to heaven , thence will I bring them down :
and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will I command the serpent , and he shall bite them :
and though they go into captivity before their enemies , thence will I command the sword , and it shall slay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven , and hath founded his troop in the earth ; he that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : the Lord is his name .
are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me , O children of Israel ? saith the Lord . have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt ? and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
behold , the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom , and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth ; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , saith the Lord .
for , lo , I will command , and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
in that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up his ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
that they may possess the remnant of Edom , and of all the heathen , which are called by my name , saith the Lord that doeth this .
and I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
and I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them , saith the Lord THY God .
the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high ; that saith in his heart , Who shall bring me down to the ground ?
though thou exalt thyself as the eagle , and though thou set THY nest among the stars , thence will I bring thee down , saith the Lord .
shall I not in that day , saith the Lord , even destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mount of Esau ?
and THY mighty men , O Teman , shall be dismayed , to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter .
but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of THY brother in the day that he became a stranger ; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction ; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress .
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress .
for the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : THY reward shall return upon thine own head .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and the house of Jacob shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble , and they shall kindle in them , and devour them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau ; for the Lord hath spoken it .
but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a mighty tempest in the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
and he said unto them , I am an Hebrew ; and I fear the Lord , the God of heaven , which hath made the sea and the dry land .
then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said unto him , Why hast thou done this ? for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord , because he had told them .
then said they unto him , What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous .
and he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you .
nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous against them .
so they took up Jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish 's belly ,
and said , I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord , and he heard me ; out of the belly of hell cried I , and thou heardest my voice .
for thou hadst cast me into the deep , in the midst of the seas ; and the floods compassed me about : all THY billows and THY waves passed over me .
the waters compassed me about , even to the soul : the depth closed me round about , the weeds were wrapped about my head .
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , O Lord my God .
when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord : and my prayer came in unto thee , into thine holy temple .
but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving ; I will pay that that I have vowed . salvation is of the Lord .
and the Lord spake unto the fish , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land .
and the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time , saying ,
so Jonah arose , and went unto Nineveh , according to the word of the Lord . now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days ' journey .
and Jonah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cried , and said , Yet forty days , and Nineveh shall be overthrown .
so the people of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
for word came unto the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
but it displeased Jonah exceedingly , and he was very angry .
therefore now , O Lord , take , I beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
so Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the Lord God prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
but God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd that it withered .
then said the Lord , Thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
the word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
hear , all ye people ; hearken , O earth , and all that therein is : and let the Lord God be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
for , behold , the Lord cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
and the mountains shall be molten under him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as the waters that are poured down a steep place .
for the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the transgression of Jacob ? is it not Samaria ? and what are the high places of Judah ? are they not Jerusalem ?
therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard : and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and I will discover the foundations thereof .
therefore I will wail and howl , I will go stripped and naked : I will make a wailing like the dragons , and mourning as the owls .
for her wound is incurable ; for it is come unto Judah ; he is come unto the gate of my people , even to Jerusalem .
declare ye it not at Gath , weep ye not at all : in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust .
pass ye away , thou inhabitant of Saphir , having THY shame naked : the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth @-@ ezel ; he shall receive of you his standing .
for the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good : but evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem .
O thou inhabitant of Lachish , bind the chariot to the swift beast : she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion : for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee .
make thee bald , and poll thee for THY delicate children ; enlarge THY baldness as the eagle ; for they are gone into captivity from thee .
Woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
even of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war .
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie , saying , I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink ; he shall even be the prophet of this people .
the breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the Lord on the head of them .
and I said , Hear , I pray you , O heads of Jacob , and ye princes of the house of Israel ; Is it not for you to know judgment ?
who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the Lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err , that bite with their teeth , and cry , Peace ; and he that putteth not into their mouths , they even prepare war against him .
therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine ; and the sun shall go down over the prophets , and the day shall be dark over them .
then shall the seers be ashamed , and the diviners confounded : yea , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer of God .
but truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord , and of judgment , and of might , to declare unto Jacob his transgression , and to Israel his sin .
hear this , I pray you , ye heads of the house of Jacob , and princes of the house of Israel , that abhor judgment , and pervert all equity .
therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
but in the last days it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains , and it shall be exalted above the hills ; and people shall flow unto it .
and he shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afar off ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever .
in that day , saith the Lord , will I assemble her that halteth , and I will gather her that is driven out , and her that I have afflicted ;
and I will make her that halted a remnant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation : and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth , even for ever .
and thou , O tower of the flock , the strong hold of the daughter of Zion , unto thee shall it come , even the first dominion ; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem .
now why dost thou cry out aloud ? is there no king in thee ? is THY counseller perished ? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail .
now gather thyself in troops , O daughter of troops : he hath laid siege against us : they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the Assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
and they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof : thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian , when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
and the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord , as the showers upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sons of men .
Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries , and all thine enemies shall be cut off .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord , that I will cut off THY horses out of the midst of thee , and I will destroy THY chariots :
and I will cut off the cities of THY land , and throw down all THY strong holds :
and I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand ; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers :
THY Graven images also will I cut off , and THY standing images out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands .
and I will pluck up THY groves out of the midst of thee : so will I destroy THY cities .
and I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen , such as they have not heard .
hear ye now what the Lord saith ; arise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear THY voice .
hear ye , O mountains , the Lord 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth : for the Lord hath a controversy with his people , and he will plead with Israel .
for I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed thee out of the house of servants ; and I sent before thee Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
Wherewith shall I come before the Lord , and bow myself before the high God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves of a year old ?
will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that is abominable ?
shall I count them pure with the wicked balances , and with the bag of deceitful weights ?
for the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee , in making thee desolate because of THY sins .
Thou shalt eat , but not be satisfied ; and THY casting down shall be in the midst of thee ; and thou shalt take hold , but shalt not deliver ; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword .
Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
the good man is perished out of the earth : and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
the best of them is as a brier : the most upright is sharper than a Thorn hedge : the day of THY watchmen and THY visitation cometh ; now shall be their perplexity .
trust ye not in a friend , put ye not confidence in a guide : keep the doors of THY mouth from her that lieth in THY bosom .
for the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man 's enemies are the men of his own house .
therefore I will look unto the Lord ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the Lord shall be a light unto me .
I will bear the indignation of the Lord , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
in the day that THY walls are to be built , in that day shall the decree be far removed .
in that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
according to the days of THY coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things .
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
they shall lick the dust like a serpent , they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth : they shall be afraid of the Lord our God , and shall fear because of thee .
he will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
God is Jealous , and the Lord revengeth ; the Lord revengeth , and is furious ; the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth wrath for his enemies .
the Lord is slow to anger , and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked : the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
he rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers : Bashan languisheth , and Carmel , and the flower of Lebanon languisheth .
the mountains quake at him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at his presence , yea , the world , and all that dwell therein .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
the Lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he knoweth them that trust in him .
but with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue his enemies .
what do ye imagine against the Lord ? he will make an utter end : affliction shall not rise up the second time .
for while they be folden together as thorns , and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry .
thus saith the Lord : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more .
for now will I break his yoke from off thee , and will burst THY bonds in sunder .
he that dasheth in pieces is come up before THY face : keep the munition , watch the way , make THY loins strong , fortify THY power mightily .
for the Lord hath turned away the excellency of Jacob , as the excellency of Israel : for the emptiers have emptied them out , and marred their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken .
the chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightnings .
he shall recount his worthies : they shall stumble in their walk ; they shall make hast to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepared .
the gates of the rivers shall be opened , and the palace shall be dissolved .
and Huzzab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up , and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves , tabering upon their breasts .
take ye the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold : for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture .
she is empty , and void , and waste : and the heart melteth , and the knees smite together , and much pain is in all loins , and the faces of them all gather blackness .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feedingplace of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whelp , and none made them afraid ?
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with ravin .
the noise of a whip , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the pransing horses , and of the jumping chariots .
the Horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear : and there is a multitude of slain , and a great number of carcases ; and there is none end of their corpses ; they stumble upon their corpses :
because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot , the mistress of witchcrafts , that selleth nations through her whoredoms , and families through her witchcrafts .
behold , I am against thee , saith the Lord of hosts ; and I will discover THY skirts upon THY face , and I will shew the nations THY nakedness , and the kingdoms THY shame .
and I will cast abominable Filth upon thee , and make thee vile , and will set thee as a gazingstock .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , Nineveh is laid waste : who will bemoan her ? whence shall I seek comforters for thee ?
art thou better than populous No , that was situate among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
yet was she carried away , she went into captivity : her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
Thou also shalt be drunken : thou shalt be hid , thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy .
all THY strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
behold , THY people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of THY land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies : the fire shall devour THY bars .
draw thee waters for the siege , fortify THY strong holds : go into clay , and tread the morter , make strong the brickkiln .
there shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm : make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locusts .
THY crowned are as the locusts , and THY captains as the great grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day , but when the sun ariseth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
THY shepherds slumber , O king of Assyria : THY nobles shall dwell in the dust : THY people is scattered upon the mountains , and no man gathereth them .
there is no healing of THY bruise ; THY wound is grievous : all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee : for upon whom hath not THY wickedness passed continually ?
why dost thou shew me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ? for spoiling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up strife and contention .
therefore the law is slacked , and judgment doth never go forth : for the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth .
behold ye among the heathen , and regard , and wonder marvellously : for I will work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
for , lo , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
they are terrible and dreadful : their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves .
their horses also are swifter than the leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves : and their horsemen shall spread themselves , and their horsemen shall come from far ; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat .
they shall come all for violence : their faces shall sup up as the east wind , and they shall gather the captivity as the sand .
and they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , imputing this his power unto his god .
Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil , and canst not look on iniquity : wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously , and holdest THY tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he ?
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
therefore they sacrifice unto their net , and burn incense unto their drag ; because by them their portion is fat , and their meat plenteous .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am reproved .
and the Lord answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
behold , his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him : but the just shall live by his faith .
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booties unto them ?
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
Thou hast consulted shame to THY house by cutting off many people , and hast sinned against THY soul .
for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and stablisheth a city by iniquity !
behold , is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity ?
for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea .
Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , that puttest THY bottle to him , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
God came from Teman , and the Holy One from mount Paran . Selah . his glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
and his brightness was as the light ; he had horns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction : and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble .
was the Lord displeased against the rivers ? was thine anger against the rivers ? was THY wrath against the sea , that thou didst ride upon thine horses and THY chariots of salvation ?
THY bow was made quite naked , according to the oaths of the tribes , even THY word . Selah . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
the mountains saw thee , and they trembled : the overflowing of the water passed by : the deep uttered his voice , and lifted up his hands on high .
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation : at the light of thine arrows they went , and at the shining of THY glittering spear .
Thou didst march through the land in indignation , thou didst thresh the heathen in anger .
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of THY people , even for salvation with thine anointed ; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discovering the foundation unto the neck . Selah .
Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages : they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me : their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly .
Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses , through the heap of great waters .
yet I will rejoice in the Lord , I will joy in the God of my salvation .
the word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hizkiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
I will utterly consume all things from off the land , saith the Lord .
I will consume man and beast ; I will consume the fowls of the heaven , and the fishes of the sea , and the stumblingblocks with the wicked ; and I will cut off man from off the land , saith the Lord .
hold THY peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand : for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath bid his guests .
and it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord 's sacrifice , that I will punish the princes , and the king 's children , and all such as are clothed with strange apparel .
in the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill their masters ' houses with violence and deceit .
therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation : they shall also build houses , but not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , but not drink the wine thereof .
the great day of the Lord is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the Lord : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
seek ye the Lord , all ye meek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord 's anger .
for Gaza shall be forsaken , and Ashkelon a desolation : they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day , and Ekron shall be rooted up .
this shall they have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts .
the Lord will be terrible unto them : for he will famish all the gods of the earth ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the isles of the heathen .
and he will stretch out his hand against the north , and destroy Assyria ; and will make Nineveh a desolation , and dry like a wilderness .
she obeyed not the voice ; she received not correction ; she trusted not in the Lord ; she drew not near to her God .
her princes within her are roaring lions ; her judges are evening wolves ; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow .
her prophets are light and treacherous persons : her priests have polluted the sanctuary , they have done violence to the law .
for then will I turn to the people a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of the Lord , to serve him with one consent .
from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all THY doings , wherein thou hast transgressed against me : for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in THY pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain .
I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the Lord .
the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
the Lord hath taken away THY judgments , he hath cast out thine enemy : the king of Israel , even the Lord , is in the midst of thee : thou shalt not see evil any more .
in that day it shall be said to Jerusalem , Fear thou not : and to Zion , Let not thine hands be Slack .
the Lord THY God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
in the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , saying ,
Ye have sown much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clothe you , but there is none warm ; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes .
therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew , and the earth is stayed from her fruit .
and I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon men , and upon cattle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , with all the remnant of the people , obeyed the voice of the Lord their God , and the words of Haggai the prophet , as the Lord their God had sent him , and the people did fear before the Lord .
in the seventh month , in the one and twentieth day of the month , came the word of the Lord by the prophet Haggai , saying ,
speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , and to the residue of the people , saying ,
who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory ? and how do ye see it now ? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing ?
according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt , so my spirit remaineth among you : fear ye not .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the dry land ;
and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with glory , saith the Lord of hosts .
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith the Lord .
consider now from this day and upward , from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temple was laid , consider it .
and again the word of the Lord came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms , and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen ; and I will overthrow the chariots , and those that ride in them ; and the horses and their riders shall come down , every one by the sword of his brother .
in the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying ,
therefore say thou unto them , Thus saith the Lord of hosts ; Turn ye unto me , saith the Lord of hosts , and I will turn unto you , saith the Lord of hosts .
your fathers , where are they ? and the prophets , do they live for ever ?
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Sebat , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo the prophet , saying ,
I saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , speckled , and white .
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said , These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
and they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the myrtle trees , and said , We have walked to and fro through the earth , and , behold , all the earth sitteth still , and is at rest .
then the angel of the Lord answered and said , O Lord of hosts , how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years ?
and the Lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words .
and I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease : for I was but a little displeased , and they helped forward the affliction .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and saw , and behold four horns .
I lifted up mine eyes again , and looked , and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand .
and , behold , the angel that talked with me went forth , and another angel went out to meet him ,
for I , saith the Lord , will be unto her a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of her .
Ho , ho , come forth , and flee from the land of the north , saith the Lord : for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven , saith the Lord .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
sing and rejoice , O daughter of Zion : for , lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the Lord .
and many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
be silent , O all flesh , before the Lord : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation .
and he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord , and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him .
and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the filthy garments from him . and unto him he said , behold , I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and I will clothe thee with change of raiment .
and I said , Let them set a fair Mitre upon his head . so they set a fair Mitre upon his head , and clothed him with garments . and the angel of the Lord stood by .
and the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua , saying ,
hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou , and THY fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant the branch .
and the angel that talked with me came again , and waked me , as a man that is wakened out of his sleep ,
and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
then he answered and spake unto me , saying , This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the Lord of hosts .
the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you .
then answered I , and said unto him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
and I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
then I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and behold a flying roll .
and , behold , there was lifted up a talent of lead : and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah .
and he said , This is wickedness . and he cast it into the midst of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stork : and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four chariots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
in the first chariot were red horses ; and in the second chariot black horses ;
and in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses .
and the angel answered and said unto me , These are the four spirits of the heavens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
the black horses which are therein go forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after them ; and the grisled go forth toward the south country .
and the bay went forth , and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth : and he said , Get you hence , walk to and fro through the earth . so they walked to and fro through the earth .
then cried he upon me , and spake unto me , saying , behold , these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country .
and the word of the Lord came unto me , saying ,
take of them of the captivity , even of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah ;
then take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest ;
and speak unto him , saying , Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts , saying , behold the man whose name is The branch ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temple of the Lord :
even he shall build the temple of the Lord ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and the crowns shall be to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the Lord .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius , that the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in Chisleu ;
speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
and oppress not the widow , nor the fatherless , the stranger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart .
but they refused to hearken , and pulled away the shoulder , and stopped their ears , that they should not hear .
therefore it is come to pass , that as he cried , and they would not hear ; so they cried , and I would not hear , saith the Lord of hosts :
thus saith the Lord ; I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the holy mountain .
for before these days there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction : for I set all men every one against his neighbour .
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
for thus saith the Lord of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith the Lord of hosts , and I repented not :
so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah : fear ye not .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are things that I hate , saith the Lord .
thus saith the Lord of hosts ; It shall yet come to pass , that there shall come people , and the inhabitants of many cities :
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord , and to seek the Lord of hosts : I will go also .
Yea , many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem , and to pray before the Lord .
the burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach , and Damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of Israel , shall be toward the Lord .
and Tyrus did build herself a strong hold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
behold , the Lord will cast her out , and he will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire .
Ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and Ekron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
and a Bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
and I will encamp about mine house because of the army , because of him that passeth by , and because of him that returneth : and no oppressor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
as for thee also , by the blood of THY Covenant I have sent forth THY prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water .
turn you to the strong hold , ye prisoners of hope : even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee ;
and the Lord shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds of the south .
and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an ensign upon his land .
for how great is his Goodness , and how great is his beauty ! corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the maids .
ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the Lord shall make bright clouds , and give them showers of rain , to every one grass in the field .
out of him came forth the corner , out of him the nail , out of him the battle bow , out of him every oppressor together .
and they shall be as mighty men , which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the Lord is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
and I will strengthen the house of Judah , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them again to place them ; for I have mercy upon them : and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am the Lord their God , and will hear them .
and they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : yea , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord .
I will hiss for them , and gather them ; for I have redeemed them : and they shall increase as they have increased .
and I will sow them among the people : and they shall remember me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children , and turn again .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Labanon ; and place shall not be found for them .
and he shall pass through the sea with affliction , and shall smite the waves in the sea , and all the deeps of the river shall dry up : and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down , and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away .
and I will strengthen them in the Lord ; and they shall walk up and down in his name , saith the Lord .
Howl , fir tree ; for the cedar is fallen ; because the mighty are spoiled : howl , O ye oaks of Bashan ; for the forest of the vintage is come down .
there is a voice of the howling of the shepherds ; for their glory is spoiled : a voice of the roaring of young lions ; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled .
three shepherds also I cut off in one month ; and my soul lothed them , and their soul also abhorred me .
then said I , I will not feed you : that that dieth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another .
and I took my staff , even Beauty , and cut it assunder , that I might break my Covenant which I had made with all the people .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord .
and I said unto them , If ye think good , give me my price ; and if not , forbear . so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver .
and the Lord said unto me , cast it unto the Potter : a goodly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the Potter in the house of the Lord .
the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel , saith the Lord , which stretcheth forth the heavens , and layeth the foundation of the earth , and formeth the spirit of man within him .
behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem .
and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it .
in that day , saith the Lord , I will smite every horse with astonishment , and his Rider with madness : and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah , and will smite every horse of the people with blindness .
and the governors of Judah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the Lord of hosts their God .
the Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first , that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah .
in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the angel of the Lord before them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord of hosts , that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they shall no more be remembered : and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
but he shall say , I am no prophet , I am an husbandman ; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , saith the Lord , two parts therein shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left therein .
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished ; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
then shall the Lord go forth , and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the light shall not be clear , nor dark :
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord , not day , nor night : but it shall come to pass , that at evening time it shall be light .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and the Lord shall be king over all the earth : in that day shall there be one Lord , and his name one .
and men shall dwell in it , and there shall be no more utter destruction ; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited .
and this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem ; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consume away in their holes , and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
and Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the Camel , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , and to keep the feast of tabernacles .
and it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS unto the Lord ; and the pots in the Lord 's house shall be like the bowl 's before the altar .
and now , I pray you , beseech God that he will be gracious unto us : this hath been by your means : will he regard your persons ? saith the Lord of hosts .
but ye have profaned it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is polluted ; and the fruit thereof , even his meat , is contemptible .
behold , I will corrupt your seed , and spread Dung upon your faces , even the Dung of your solemn feasts ; and one shall take you away with it .
and ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you , that my Covenant might be with Levi , saith the Lord of hosts .
my Covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me , and was afraid before my name .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth : for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupted the Covenant of Levi , saith the Lord of hosts .
have we not all one father ? hath not one God created us ? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother , by profaning the Covenant of our fathers ?
Judah hath dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
the Lord will cut off the man that doeth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tabernacles of Jacob , and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts .
behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to this temple , even the messenger of the Covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the Lord of hosts .
but who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like a refiner 's fire , and like fullers ' soap :
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver : and he shall purify the sons of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness .
then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord , as in the days of old , and as in former years .
Ye are Cursed with a curse : for ye have robbed me , even this whole nation .
and I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field , saith the Lord of hosts .
and now we call the proud happy ; yea , they that work wickedness are set up ; yea , they that tempt God are even delivered .
then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another : and the Lord hearkened , and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord , and that thought upon his name .
but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as calves of the stall .
and ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this , saith the Lord of hosts .
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse .
and Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ;
and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy ghost .
then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus : for he shall save his people from their sins .
now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us .
then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name Jesus .
when Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
and thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
and he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
when he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
and was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
in Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
and he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
but when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
in those days came John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judaea ,
and the same John had his raiment of Camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy ghost , and with fire :
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
and Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
and when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
and saith unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
and leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
and Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
and going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
and Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
and his fame went throughout all Syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with devils , and those which were lunatick , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them .
and seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him :
blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
Ye are the light of the world . a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
for I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
but I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
but I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
and if THY right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of THY members should perish , and not that THY whole body should be cast into hell .
and if THY right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of THY members should perish , and not that THY whole body should be cast into hell .
it hath been said , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
but I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths :
Ye have heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
but I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on THY right cheek , turn to him the other also .
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away THY coat , let him have THY cloke also .
give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
Ye have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love THY neighbour , and hate thine enemy .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
and if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
but when thou doest alms , let not THY left hand know what THY right hand doeth :
but thou , when thou prayest , enter into THY closet , and when thou hast shut THY door , pray to THY Father which is in secret ; and THY Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
but when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen .
that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto THY Father which is in secret : and THY Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
the light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , THY whole body shall be full of light .
but if thine eye be evil , THY whole body shall be full of darkness . if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
and why take ye thought for raiment ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
and yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
Wherefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
( for after all these things do the Gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
but seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye Mete , it shall be measured to you again .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in THY brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
or how wilt thou say to THY brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of THY brother 's eye .
give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
Ye shall know them by their fruits . do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
and it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
and I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
and Jesus said unto the centurion , Go THY way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
and when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick of a fever .
and he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
when the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
and Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
and he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
so the devils besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
and he said unto them , Go . and when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
and , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
and he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; THY sins be forgiven thee .
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) arise , take up THY bed , and go unto thine house .
but when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
and as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me . and he arose , and followed him .
and it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
but when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
but go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
and Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
and , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
but Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; THY faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
but when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
but they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
as they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
and when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
these twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
and as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , inquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as Serpents , and harmless as doves .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
for it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
what I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
for I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
and he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
he that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man 's reward .
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
and it came to pass , when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see :
the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
for this is he , of whom it is written , behold , I send my messenger before THY face , which shall prepare THY way before thee .
Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
and from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
and if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
but I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
and thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
but I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
at that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto Babes .
even so , Father : for so it seemed good in THY sight .
all things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
at that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred , and began to pluck the ears of corn , and to eat .
but when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , behold , THY disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
but he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ;
how he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
but if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
and when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue :
and , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . and they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
and he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
but when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
he shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
a bruised Reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
but when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
and Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
but if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
Wherefore I say unto you , All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the Holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
and whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
but I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
for by THY words thou shalt be justified , and by THY words thou shalt be condemned .
but he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas :
the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
while he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
for whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
the same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
and when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
and when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
he answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
for whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
for this people 's heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . this is he which received seed by the way side .
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
but when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
but he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
the field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
the enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
and it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
for Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
and the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath 's sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
and his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
and his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
when Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
and Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
and when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
and he said , Come . and when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
and when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
and when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
but he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . and if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
these are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
then Jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
then came she and worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me .
but he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to dogs .
then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is THY faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
and Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
and great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
Insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
and he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of Magdala ,
the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
he answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
and in the morning , It will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowring . O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas . and he left them , and departed .
and when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
how is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees ?
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
and I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
but he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
for what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
for the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
and was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
while he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
and when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
and when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
and as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen again from the dead .
but I say unto you , That Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
and Jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
Wherefore if THY hand or THY foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
and if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
but if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
and if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
Verily I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
and when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
but forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
the servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
but the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
and his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
so when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
and his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
so likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses .
and it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ;
he saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
and I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
for there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
and again I say unto you , It is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
and every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
they say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
so when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
and when they had received it , they murmured against the Goodman of the house ,
saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
take that thine is , and go THY way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
so the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
then came to him the mother of Zebedee 's children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
but Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? they say unto him , We are able .
and when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
but Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
but it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
and the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
and if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
and the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
and Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David ; they were sore displeased ,
and he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
and Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
the baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
for John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
but last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
but when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
and they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
and when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables , and said ,
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
and the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
but when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
they say unto him , Caesar 's . then saith he unto them , render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar 's ; and unto God the things that are God 's .
when they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
but as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
but when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord THY God with all THY heart , and with all THY soul , and with all THY mind .
he saith unto them , How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying ,
the Lord said unto my Lord , sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies THY footstool ?
then spake Jesus to the multitude , and to his disciples ,
all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
but woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
Woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
and he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness .
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered THY children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
and Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
and Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
and because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
and woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
for then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
and except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened .
for there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
Wherefore if they shall say unto you , behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
for as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
so likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
but as the days of Noe were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the Ark ,
and knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
but know this , that if the Goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
they that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
and unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
but he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
and I was afraid , and went and hid THY talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
for unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
for I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
and the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , depart from me , ye Cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
the Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
and as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
but I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father 's kingdom .
and when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
he went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , THY will be done .
and he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
and while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
and , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smote off his ear .
in that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
and they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
but Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest 's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
but Jesus held his peace . and the high priest answered and said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God .
then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
and when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
and after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , surely thou also art one of them ; for THY speech bewrayeth thee .
and Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the Cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly .
when the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
and when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
and the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
and when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a Reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , hail , King of the Jews !
and they spit upon him , and took the Reed , and smote him on the head .
and after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
and as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
and they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
he trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
and straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a Reed , and gave him to drink .
and , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
and came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedee 's children .
when the even was come , there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
and when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
so they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Jesus , which was crucified .
he is not here : for he is risen , as he said . come , see the place where the Lord lay .
and go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
and as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . and they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
so they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day .
then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy ghost :
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . Amen .
the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
and there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
and John was clothed with Camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
and it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
and straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
and he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
and when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
and straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
and they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
and they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
and when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
and forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
but Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
and he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
and in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
and there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
and as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
and saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go THY way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for THY cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and again he entered into Capernaum , after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
and straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
and they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
when Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , THY sins be forgiven thee .
and immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , arise , and take up THY bed , and walk ?
and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
and as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . and he arose and followed him .
and it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
when Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but THY disciples fast not ?
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
and he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
and they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
and when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
and he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
for he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
and unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
and he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
there came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , behold my mother and my brethren !
and he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
and he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
and some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
but when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
and when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
and he said unto them , unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
and these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
and these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
for there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
and he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye Mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
for he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath .
for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
but when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
but without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples .
and the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side .
and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
and he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
and he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . and the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
and they came over unto the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
and forthwith Jesus gave them leave . and the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
and they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
and they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the Legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
and when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
and he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
but the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
and they laughed him to scorn . but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
and straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great astonishment .
and he went out from thence , and came into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Juda , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? and they were offended at him .
but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and he marvelled because of their unbelief . and he went round about the villages , teaching .
and he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
and they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
but when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
and when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a Supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ;
and when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
and the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
and immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
and brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
and when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
and the Apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
and he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
and the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
and Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
and they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
and when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
but when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
for they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
and when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
and when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
then came together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from Jerusalem .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
for laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
and when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , Hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
and when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
for from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
and from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
for a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
the woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
but Jesus said unto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it unto the dogs .
and when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
and again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
and they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
and he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
and straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
and if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
so they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
and the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , whom do men say that I am ?
and he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
and he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
and after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
and his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
and there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
for he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
but I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
and straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
and they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
when Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
but Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
and they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
and he came to Capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
but they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
and he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
and if THY hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
and if THY foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
for every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
and he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
but when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
and he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
and James and John , the sons of Zebedee , come unto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
they said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on THY right hand , and the other on THY left hand , in THY glory .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
but Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
but so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
for even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? the blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
and they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
and they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
and they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
and many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
and they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest .
and Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
and on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry :
and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
and they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
and he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
and when even was come , he went out of the city .
and in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
for verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
and they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
but those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
and they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
shall we give , or shall we not give ? but he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it .
and Jesus answering said unto them , render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . and they marvelled at him .
now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
and the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
in the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
and as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
he is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
and thou shalt love the Lord THY God with all THY heart , and with all THY soul , and with all THY mind , and with all THY strength : this is the first commandment .
and the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love THY neighbour as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
and when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . and no man after that durst ask him any question .
for David himself said by the Holy ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies THY footstool .
and Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
and he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury :
and Jesus answering said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
but when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy ghost .
now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains :
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
but woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
and except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
and then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
so ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
for the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the Porter to watch .
after two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
for ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
and when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . and he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
and the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
and wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the Goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
the Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
and he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
and when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
and they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , sit ye here , while I shall pray .
and he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
and he said , ABBA , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
and again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
and when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
and he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
and as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
and they laid their hands on him , and took him .
and one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
and Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
and Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and THY speech agreeth thereto .
and the second time the Cock crew . and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the Cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept .
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to Pilate .
and the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
and Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
and there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
and Pilate answered and said again unto them , What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? and they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
and so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
and the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
and they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
and they smote him on the head with a Reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
and when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
and they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
and they bring him unto the place golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
and when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
and it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
and the superscription of his accusation was written over , the King of the Jews .
and with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
and when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a Reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
and when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
there were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
and when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
and when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
and he saith unto them , Be not affrighted : Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
and they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
after that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
so then after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God .
and they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen .
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
there was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
and they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
and there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
and when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
but the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for THY prayer is heard ; and THY wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
and thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy ghost , even from his mother 's womb .
and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
and the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
and , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
and when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
and the angel came in unto her , and said , hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
and , behold , thou shalt conceive in THY womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name Jesus .
he shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
and the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
and , behold , THY cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
and Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ;
and entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
and whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
for , lo , as soon as the voice of THY salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
and blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
and Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
he hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
he hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
he hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
he hath holpen his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
now Elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
and his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God .
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the Lord was with him .
to perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy Covenant ;
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
and it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus , that all the world should be taxed .
and all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
and Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
and , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
and this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .
and it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
and they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
and the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
and , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy ghost was upon him .
and it was revealed unto him by the Holy ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
for mine eyes have seen THY salvation ,
and Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
and when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him .
and it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
and he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene ,
Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
as it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
he answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
and Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph ,
which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge ,
which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda ,
which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of ER ,
which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi ,
which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim ,
which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David ,
which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of salmon , which was the son of Naasson ,
which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda ,
which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech ,
which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan ,
which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
and Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
and the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord THY God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash THY foot against a stone .
and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
and all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . and they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ?
but unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
and all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
and came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
and they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
and Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold THY peace , and come out of him . and when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
and they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
and when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
and it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret ,
and saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
and he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . and he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
and when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
and they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
for he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
and he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . and immediately the leprosy departed from him .
and he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for THY cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
and , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
and they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
and he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
and he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
but new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
and certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
and Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
how he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
and it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
and the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
and looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , Stretch forth THY hand . and he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
and it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away THY cloke forbid not to take THY coat also .
give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away THY goods ask them not again .
and as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
and if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . for with the same measure that ye Mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
the disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in THY brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
and a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
and when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
and when they came to Jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , That he was worthy for whom he should do this :
when Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
and it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
and when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
and he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he delivered him to his mother .
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
this is he , of whom it is written , behold , I send my messenger before THY face , which shall prepare THY way before thee .
for I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
and all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
for John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil .
and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
and it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him ,
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . and when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
they on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
and that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
but that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
no man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light .
for nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
and he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
but as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
and they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
and they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
and Jesus asked him , saying , What is THY name ? and he said , Legion : because many devils were entered into him .
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
when they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
and it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
and , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
for he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . but as he went the people thronged him .
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
and he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , maid , arise .
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
and whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
and the Apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
he said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
and he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels .
but I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
and as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
and , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias :
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
while he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
and , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
but they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
and it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
and they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
and when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ?
but he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and Jesus said unto him , foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
after these things the Lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
therefore said he unto them , The harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
and if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
and in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . go not from house to house .
and into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
but I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
but it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
behold , I give unto you power to tread on Serpents and Scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
all things are delivered to me of my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him .
and he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
for I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
he said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
and he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord THY God with all THY heart , and with all THY soul , and with all THY strength , and with all THY mind ; and THY neighbour as thyself .
and Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
and likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
but a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
and went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an Inn , and took care of him .
and on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
and she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
and he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be THY name . THY kingdom come . THY will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
and forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . and lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
and I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
and he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . and it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
but if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
he that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
for as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
the men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
no man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , THY whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , THY body also is full of darkness .
if THY whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
and as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
and the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
but rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
Woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
and as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
in the mean time , when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people , insomuch that they trode one upon another , he began to say unto his disciples first of all , beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
and I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
but I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
and whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy ghost it shall not be forgiven .
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
and he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
the life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
if then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
but rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
and this know , that if the Goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
then Peter said unto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
and the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
of a truth I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
and that servant , which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division :
the father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
and he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is .
and when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass .
Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
or those Eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
and , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity Eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
and he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
the Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
and ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these Eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
and he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
and he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that Fox , behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered THY children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
and it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
and Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
and they held their peace . and he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
and answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
but when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
and they all with one consent began to make excuse . the first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
and the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
and whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
so likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
and when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
and when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
and bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be merry .
now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
and he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and THY father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
but as soon as this THY son was come , which hath devoured THY living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
it was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this THY brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
and he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
and he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of THY stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? and he said , An hundred measures of wheat . and he said unto him , Take THY bill , and write fourscore .
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's , who shall give you that which is your own ?
no servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
and the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
and it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham 's bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
and in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
and beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
take heed to yourselves : if THY brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
but which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
and will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not .
so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
and it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
and when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . and it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
and he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
for as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
and as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the Ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed .
in that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
and shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
and the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
and they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
for it is easier for a Camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
and they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
and it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
and they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
and , behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
and he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
and he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
and when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at THY house .
and when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
and Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord ; behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
for the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
and as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
and it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
for I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
and he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
and if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
and they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
and they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
and he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
and when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this THY day , the things which belong unto THY peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
for the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and THY children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of THY visitation .
and he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
and it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
and he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
but when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
so they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
and he said unto them , render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar 's , and unto God the things which be God 's .
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
and Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
and he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake .
then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
for these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
but woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
and there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
when they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
so likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand .
watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives .
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover .
and he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
for I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
and he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
but , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
and truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
and they began to inquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
and there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
but ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
for whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
and the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
and he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? and they said , Nothing .
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
and he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
and when he was at the place , he said unto them , pray that ye enter not into temptation .
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
when they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
when I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . and Peter followed afar off .
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
and when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
and as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
and if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? and he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
and Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
and the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
no , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
( who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
but they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
for , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
for if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
and there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , this IS the King of the Jews .
but the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into THY hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
and all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
and all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
and , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counseller ; and he was a good man , and a just :
( the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
this man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
and the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
and it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
he is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
and returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
it was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the Apostles .
then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days ?
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
and they said one to another , did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
and as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
but they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
and when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
and , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
and he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
and it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
in the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
the same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
he was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
that was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
he was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
but as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
and the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
no man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
he it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe 's latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , behold the lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
and I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
and I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy ghost .
again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ;
one of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
and he brought him to Jesus . and when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
and he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
and both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
and when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine .
and there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
after this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
and when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , except a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God .
Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ?
Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
if I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ?
and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
for God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
he that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
and this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
and John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him .
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
for he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .
then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
( for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
then saith the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans .
but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
the woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not THY husband : in that saidst thou truly .
Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
but the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
and he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
and many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
so when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
and said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of THY saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
so Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
when he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
Jesus saith unto him , Go THY way ; THY son liveth . and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . and they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
so the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
after this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
and a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
the impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
and he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
the man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole .
and therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
for the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
for as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will .
for the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son :
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
for as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
and hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
but I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
but I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
and the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
and ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
but I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
after these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias .
and a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
and Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
and the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
when Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
and Jesus said , Make the men sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
and Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
and when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
and entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . and it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .
Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
and Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
all that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
for I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
and this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
no man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
it is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
he that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
as the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
this is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
what and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
it is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
and he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my Father .
and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God .
after these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him .
now the Jews ' feast of tabernacles was at hand .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
the world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast ; for my time is not yet full come .
when he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
the Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye cannot come .
what manner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye cannot come ?
in the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
( but this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet .
others said , This is the Christ . but some said , shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ?
the officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
this they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . but Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
when Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
and yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
these words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye cannot come .
then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye cannot come .
I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
and he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
they answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
which of you convinceth me of sin ? and if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God :
yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
and as Jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth .
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
when he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
and said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
the neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
and it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
but the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
but by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
these words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
he answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
we know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
the man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
and Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
and when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
and a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
this parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
the thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
but he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
the hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
and other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
no man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this commandment have I received of my Father .
Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my Father 's name , they bear witness of me .
but ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
my Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand .
say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
but if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
now a certain man was sick , named Lazarus , of Bethany , the town of Mary and her sister Martha .
( it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
when Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
these things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep .
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
but I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
and when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
as soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
the Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
then when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
when Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
and I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him .
but some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
and one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all ,
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
and the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
there they made him a Supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
this he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
on the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
for this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
and Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
he that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
and I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
but though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
that the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
and if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
and Supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ;
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
he riseth from Supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
after that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
so after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
if I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another 's feet .
for I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
when Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a Sop , when I have dipped it . and when he had dipped the Sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye cannot come ; so now I say to you .
a new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down THY life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The Cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .
in my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
if ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
if ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it .
yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
at that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's which sent me .
but the Comforter , which is the Holy ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . if ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I.
and now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you .
abide in me , and I in you . as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
I am the vine , ye are the branches : he that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
these things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
this is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you .
henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
if I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloke for their sin .
if I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father .
but this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause .
but when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
and ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
they shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
and these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
but because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
and when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ;
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
he shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
all things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
and ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
at that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you :
for the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
these things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world .
these words spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify THY Son , that THY Son also may glorify thee :
as thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
and this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .
I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
and now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
I have manifested THY name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept THY word .
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
for I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
and now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
and now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
I have given them THY word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
as thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
and for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
and I have declared unto them THY name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the Brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
as soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
then asked he them again , whom seek ye ? and they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Malchus .
and led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
and Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said .
and when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
when Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . and they took Jesus , and led him away .
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew golgotha :
and Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , Jesus of NAZARETH the King of the Jews .
this title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
when Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold THY son !
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
and he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
and there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
so they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
and he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
for as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
but Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
and seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
and when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
Jesus saith unto her , Mary . she turned herself , and saith unto him , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master .
and when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
and after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
then saith he to Thomas , reach hither THY finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither THY hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not Faithless , but believing .
and many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
but when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his Fisher 's coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
as soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
Jesus saith unto them , Come and dine . and none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
this is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth THY hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God :
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
when they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , Lord , wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel ?
and he said unto them , It is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his own power .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea , and in Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
and when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day 's journey .
and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
and it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
and when the day of Pentecost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them .
and they were all filled with the Holy ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews , devout men , out of every nation under heaven .
now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit ; and they shall prophesy :
and I will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable day of the Lord come :
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved .
Ye men of Israel , hear these words ; Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
whom God hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
for David speaketh concerning him , I foresaw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with THY countenance .
men and brethren , let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David , that he is both dead and buried , and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ , that his soul was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles , Men and brethren , what shall we do ?
then Peter said unto them , repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy ghost .
for the promise is unto you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as the Lord our God shall call .
then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and they continued stedfastly in the Apostles ' doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
and sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength .
and he leaping up stood , and walked , and entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising God .
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
but ye denied the Holy One and the Just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ;
but those things , which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he hath so fulfilled .
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
and it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
Yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
Ye are the children of the prophets , and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers , saying unto Abraham , And in THY seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
and as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
and they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
and Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
then Peter , filled with the Holy ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem ; and we cannot deny it .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
for the man was above forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
and being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
the kings of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord , and against his Christ .
by stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of THY holy child Jesus .
and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
but a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
and Ananias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
and the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
and great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
and by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in Solomon 's porch .
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
then the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the Sadducees , ) and were filled with indignation ,
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they feared the people , lest they should have been stoned .
the God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour , for to give repentance to Israel , and forgiveness of sins .
and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the Holy ghost , whom God hath given to them that obey him .
when they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them .
and now I say unto you , refrain from these men , and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will come to nought :
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the Apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
and they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , It is not reason that we should leave the word of God , and serve tables .
Wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
and the word of God increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the Libertines , and Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia and of Asia , disputing with Stephen .
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
and they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
and set up false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law :
for we have heard him say , that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us .
and all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and dwelt in Charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
and God spake on this wise , That his seed should sojourn in a strange land ; and that they should bring them into bondage , and entreat them evil four hundred years .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge , said God : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
but when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
and at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ; and Joseph 's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh .
and were carried over into Sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem .
but when the time of the promise drew nigh , which God had sworn to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt ,
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
then fled Moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of Madian , where he begat two sons .
and when forty years were expired , there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush .
then said the Lord to him , Put off THY shoes from THY feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground .
I have seen , I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them . and now come , I will send thee into Egypt .
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
he brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is that Moses , which said unto the children of Israel , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
Yea , ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness , as he had appointed , speaking unto Moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
but he , being full of the Holy ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
and cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet , whose name was Saul .
and he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , Lord , lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this , he fell asleep .
and Saul was consenting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria , except the Apostles .
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
for unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
but there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy ghost :
( for as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
repent therefore of this THY wickedness , and pray God , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity .
then answered Simon , and said , pray ye to the Lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
and the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip , saying , arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza , which is desert .
and he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? and he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
the place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
and he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
and when they were come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
and as he journeyed , he came near Damascus : and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven :
and he said , Who art thou , Lord ? and the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
and he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? and the Lord said unto him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
and hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
but the Lord said unto him , Go THY way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles , and kings , and the children of Israel :
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues , that he is the Son of God .
but Saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is very Christ .
and when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
and he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy ghost , were multiplied .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
and there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
and all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him , and turned to the Lord .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
and forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
but Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
and he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
and now send men to Joppa , and call for one Simon , whose surname is Peter :
he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do .
and when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
and when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to Joppa .
on the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
and he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ,
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and the morrow after they entered into Caesarea . and Cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
and as Peter was coming in , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
and as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
therefore came I unto you without gainsaying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
and Cornelius said , Four days ago I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
and said , Cornelius , THY prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
send therefore to Joppa , and call hither Simon , whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
the word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
and he commanded us to preach unto the people , and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead .
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy ghost .
and the Apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
and when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
but Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order unto them , saying ,
upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
and , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was , sent from Caesarea unto me .
and the spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting . moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man 's house :
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ;
then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy ghost .
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I , that I could withstand God ?
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
and some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , which , when they were come to Antioch , spake unto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Jesus .
and the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the Lord .
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
and there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
and he killed James the brother of John with the sword .
and because he saw it pleased the Jews , he proceeded further to take Peter also . ( then were the days of unleavened bread . )
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
and the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , and bind on THY sandals . and so he did . and he saith unto him , cast THY garment about thee , and follow me .
and he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
and when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark ; where many were gathered together praying .
and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named Rhoda .
but Peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
and when Herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . and he went down from Judaea to Caesarea , and there abode .
and upon a set day Herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them John , whose surname was Mark .
now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
so they , being sent forth by the Holy ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
and when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
and when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Bar @-@ Jesus :
then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord .
now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem .
but when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
and afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of CIS , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
and as John fulfilled his course , he said , whom think ye that I am ? I am not he . but , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose .
men and brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and whosoever among you feareth God , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
for they that dwell at Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
and though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , I will give you the sure mercies of David .
for David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue , the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
but when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
for so hath the Lord commanded us , saying , I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles , that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth .
and when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region .
but the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
and it came to pass in Iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed .
but the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles , and made their minds evil affected against the brethren .
but the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the Jews , and part with the Apostles .
and when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles , and also of the Jews with their rulers , to use them despitefully , and to stone them ,
they were ware of it , and fled unto Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
and there sat a certain man at Lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother 's womb , who never had walked :
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
and they called Barnabas , Jupiter ; and Paul , Mercurius , because he was the chief speaker .
then the priest of Jupiter , which was before their city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
which when the Apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of , they rent their clothes , and ran in among the people , crying out ,
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
and there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium , who persuaded the people , and , having stoned Paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
and after they had passed throughout Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
and when they had preached the word in Perga , they went down into Attalia :
and thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
and when they were come , and had gathered the church together , they rehearsed all that God had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles .
and certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren , and said , except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses , ye cannot be saved .
when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the Apostles and elders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
and when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the Apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
but there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed , saying , That it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses .
and the Apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved , even as they .
that the residue of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the Lord , who doeth all these things .
Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God :
but that we write unto them , that they abstain from pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
it seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
so when they were dismissed , they came to Antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle :
and Judas and Silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas , Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord , and see how they do .
but Paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
and the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ;
then came he to Derbe and Lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a Jewess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium .
him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
and as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the Apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem .
and so were the churches established in the faith , and increased in number daily .
now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia , and were forbidden of the Holy ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
after they were come to Mysia , they assayed to go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
and after he had seen the vision , immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia , assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
therefore loosing from Troas , we came with a straight course to Samothracia , and the next day to Neapolis ;
and from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
the same followed Paul and us , and cried , saying , These men are the servants of the most high God , which shew unto us the way of salvation .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
and when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
and suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one 's bands were loosed .
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas ,
and they spake unto him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , straightway .
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in God with all his house .
and the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul , The magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore depart , and go in peace .
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates : and they feared , when they heard that they were Romans .
and they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
and Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
opening and alleging , that Christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom I preach unto you , is Christ .
and some of them believed , and consorted with Paul and Silas ; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
and when they found them not , they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city , crying , These that have turned the world Upside down are come hither also ;
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
and when they had taken security of Jason , and of the other , they let them go .
and the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews .
these were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the scriptures daily , whether those things were so .
therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
but when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
and then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
and they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry .
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
( for all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
then Paul stood in the midst of Mars ' hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
for as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO the unknown God . whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
God that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
that they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , Graven by art and man 's device .
because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
Howbeit certain men clave unto him , and believed : among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
and he departed thence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named Justus , one that worshipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
and Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision , Be not afraid , but speak , and hold not THY peace :
and when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and Gallio cared for none of those things .
and he came to Ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
but bade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you , if God will . and he sailed from Ephesus .
and when he had landed at Caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to Antioch .
and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly .
when they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
and when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
and he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out of them .
and there were seven sons of one Sceva , a Jew , and chief of the priests , which did so .
and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overcame them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
for a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
and when they heard these sayings , they were full of wrath , and cried out , saying , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
and the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul 's companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
and when Paul would have entered in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was confused ; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
and they drew Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . and Alexander beckoned with the hand , and would have made his defence unto the people .
for ye have brought hither these men , which are neither robbers of churches , nor yet blasphemers of your goddess .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
but if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a lawful assembly .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day 's uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
and when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
and after the uproar was ceased , Paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into Macedonia .
and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
and there abode three months . and when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into Syria , he purposed to return through Macedonia .
and we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to Troas in five days ; where we abode seven days .
and upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
and there were many lights in the upper chamber , where they were gathered together .
and Paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , Trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
when he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
and we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
and when he met with us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
and we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios ; and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next day we came to Miletus .
for Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
serving the Lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
and now , behold , I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
and now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God .
for I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto Coos , and the day following unto Rhodes , and from thence unto Patara :
and finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia , we went aboard , and set forth .
now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
and finding disciples , we tarried there seven days : who said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
and when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
and when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
and when we had finished our course from Tyre , we came to Ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
and as we tarried there many days , there came down from Judaea a certain prophet , named Agabus .
and when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to Jerusalem .
and after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to Jerusalem .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
and when we were come to Jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
and the day following Paul went in with us unto James ; and all the elders were present .
and when they heard it , they glorified the Lord , and said unto him , Thou seest , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law :
what is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vow on them ;
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
( for they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
and all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
and as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
and some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
and it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and I said , What shall I do , Lord ? and the Lord said unto me , arise , and go into Damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
and when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
and he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that Just One , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away THY sins , calling on the name of the Lord .
and when the blood of THY martyr Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
and they gave him audience unto this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should live .
and as they bound him with thongs , Paul said unto the centurion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and uncondemned ?
and the chief captain answered , With a great sum obtained I this freedom . and Paul said , But I was free born .
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of THY people .
and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
and when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
and when Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
then Paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , Bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
so the chief captain then let the young man depart , and charged him , See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
and he called unto him two centurions , saying , Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea , and horsemen threescore and ten , and spearmen two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
and provide them beasts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe unto Felix the governor .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
who , when they came to Caesarea , and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of THY clemency a few words .
for we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes :
then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship .
and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
and have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
except it be for this one voice , that I cried standing among them , touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day .
and when Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , When Lysias the chief captain shall come down , I will know the uttermost of your matter .
and he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
and after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
now when Festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto Caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
while he answered for himself , Neither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against Caesar , have I offended any thing at all .
but Festus , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
and because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
and on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
my manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ;
which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . for which hope 's sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
and when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
and I said , Who art thou , Lord ? and he said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest .
but rise , and stand upon THY feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
but shewed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
for these causes the Jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
that Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the Gentiles .
for the king knoweth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
then Agrippa said unto Paul , Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian .
and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
and entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
and the next day we touched at Sidon . and Julius courteously entreated Paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
and when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
and when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
and , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called The fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea .
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
and when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
and running under a certain island which is called Clauda , we had much work to come by the boat :
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
and now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
but when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
and sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
and when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
and when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
and when they were escaped , then they knew that the island was called Melita .
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a viper out of the heat , and fastened on his hand .
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously .
and it came to pass , that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we departed , they laded us with such things as were necessary .
and after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria , which had wintered in the isle , whose sign was Castor and Pollux .
and from thence we fetched a compass , and came to Rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to Puteoli :
where we found brethren , and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward Rome .
and from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum , and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , we know that every where it is spoken against .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well spake the Holy ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
for the heart of this people is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
to all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
first , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
for I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
that is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
or despisest thou the riches of his Goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
but after THY hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life :
but unto them that are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath ,
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
( for not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
for when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest THY boast of God ,
and knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
Thou that makest THY boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ?
for circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , THY circumcision is made uncircumcision .
therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
for he is not a Jew , which is one outwardly ; neither is that circumcision , which is outward in the flesh :
God forbid : yea , let God be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , That thou mightest be justified in THY sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged .
but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speak as a man )
and not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose damnation is just .
there is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
they are all gone out of the way , they are together become unprofitable ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
what shall we say then that Abraham our father , as pertaining to the flesh , hath found ?
now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
but to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
how was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
for the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
for if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect :
who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations ; according to that which was spoken , So shall THY seed be .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara 's womb :
he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
and being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ;
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and not only so , but we glory in Tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
and hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy ghost which is given unto us .
but God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
for if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
( for until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam 's transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
and not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ?
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him :
likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
for when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end everlasting life .
know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
for when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
for that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I.
if then I do that which I would not , I consent unto the law that it is good .
now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
for I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
for the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .
now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
for I delight in the law of God after the inward man :
but I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
O wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
for to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
and if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
for if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
for as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint @-@ heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
for we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
but if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered .
and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit , because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God .
and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
for whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
what shall we then say to these things ? if God be for us , who can be against us ?
he that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
who shall lay any thing to the charge of God 's elect ? it is God that justifieth .
who is he that condemneth ? it is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
as it is written , For THY sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
not as though the word of God hath taken none effect . for they are not all Israel , which are of Israel :
that is , They which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
and not only this ; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one , even by our father Isaac ;
for he saith to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion .
so then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth .
what if God , willing to shew his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction :
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which he had afore prepared unto glory ,
even us , whom he hath called , not of the Jews only , but also of the Gentiles ?
as he saith also in Osee , I will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her beloved , which was not beloved .
and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God .
for he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth .
what shall we say then ? that the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
but Israel , which followed after the law of righteousness , hath not attained to the law of righteousness .
Wherefore ? because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . for they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
Brethren , my heart 's desire and prayer to God for Israel is , that they might be saved .
for they being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
but what saith it ? the word is nigh thee , even in THY mouth , and in THY heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
that if thou shalt confess with THY mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
and how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
but I say , Have they not heard ? yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
but I say , did not Israel know ? first Moses saith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
but Esaias is very bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me .
I say then , Hath God cast away his people ? God forbid . for I also am an Israelite , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew . Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias ? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel , saying ,
but what saith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
what then ? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for ; but the election hath obtained it , and the rest were blinded
( according as it is written , God hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ; ) unto this day .
and David saith , Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumbling block , and a recompence unto them :
let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow down their back alway .
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
for I speak to you Gentiles , inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles , I magnify mine office :
if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh , and might save some of them .
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
for if the firstfruit be holy , the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . be not highminded , but fear :
for if God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee .
behold therefore the Goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , Goodness , if thou continue in his Goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
and they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for God is able to graff them in again .
for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
for I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in .
and so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob :
as concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sakes .
for as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
and be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
for as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
let love be without dissimulation . Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
be of the same mind one toward another . mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . be not wise in your own conceits .
if it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .
therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head .
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . for there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
for for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
the night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
for one believeth that he may eat all things : another , who is weak , eateth herbs .
let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth : for God hath received him .
he that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not the day , to the Lord he doth not regard it . he that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not , and giveth God thanks .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
for to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
but why dost thou judge THY brother ? or why dost thou set at nought THY brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
but if THY brother be grieved with THY meat , now walkest thou not charitably . destroy not him with THY meat , for whom Christ died .
for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy ghost .
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
for meat destroy not the work of God . all things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
it is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby THY brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
Hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before God . happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : for whatsoever is not of faith is sin .
for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy ghost .
and I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of Goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
Yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
but as it is written , To whom he was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that have not heard shall understand .
for it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem .
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
when therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
and I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ 's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ;
that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea :
that ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
who have for my life laid down their own necks : unto whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles .
salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen , and my fellowprisoners , who are of note among the Apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
salute Herodion my kinsman . greet them that be of the household of Narcissus , which are in the Lord .
salute Philologus , and Julia , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints which are with them .
now I beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
Timotheus my workfellow , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
but now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
I thank my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ ;
who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
God is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
for Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
for it is written , I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
but unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
for ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called :
but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ;
and base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
but of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption :
and I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
and I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
but as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
for what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
I have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
for ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ?
who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
so then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
for we are labourers together with God : ye are God 's husbandry , ye are God 's building .
according to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
if any man 's work abide which he hath built thereupon , he shall receive a reward .
if any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
if any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
let no man deceive himself . if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ;
let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of Christ , and stewards of the mysteries of God .
moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
for I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
we are fools for Christ 's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ;
and labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it :
being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the Filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
for though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
now some are puffed up , as though I would not come to you .
but I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are puffed up , but the power .
for the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
what will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles , that one should have his father 's wife .
and ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . for even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us :
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
know ye not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things that pertain to this life ?
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
I speak to your shame . is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
and God hath both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
what ? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ? for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
for ye are bought with a price : therefore glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's .
now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
the wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
for I would that all men were even as I myself . but every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
but if they cannot contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
and unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
but and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
but if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
for what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save THY husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save THY wife ?
but as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . and so ordain I in all churches .
is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . is any called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
for he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lord 's Freeman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Christ 's servant .
now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but I would have you without carefulness . he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord :
but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
and this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
and if any man think that he knoweth anything , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
but if any man love God , the same is known of him .
as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
but meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
am I not an Apostle ? am I not free ? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord ? are not ye my work in the Lord ?
if I be not an Apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other Apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
if we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter ?
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
for if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
what is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
for though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
and unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
and this I do for the gospel 's sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? so run , that ye may obtain .
but I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
moreover , brethren , I would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
and did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them : and that Rock was Christ .
now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
neither let us tempt Christ , as some of them also tempted , and were destroyed of Serpents .
neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
now all these things happened unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
behold Israel after the flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter ?
but I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord 's table , and of the table of devils .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man 's conscience ?
for if I by grace be a partaker , why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
give none offence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church of God :
even as I please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
but I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
for the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
for as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of god .
now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
for there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
when ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's Supper .
for in eating every one taketh before other his own Supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
after the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
for as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord 's death till he come .
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord 's body .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
but when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . and the rest will I set in order when I come .
Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
and there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all .
for as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Christ .
if the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
and if the ear shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
if the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? if the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
Nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
and those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
for our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked :
that there should be no Schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
and whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .
and though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
but when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
when I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
I would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
and even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
what is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at THY giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
I thank my God , I speak with tongues more than ye all :
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
in the law it is written , With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people ; and yet for all that will they not hear me , saith the Lord .
Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
if any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
but if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
for ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
for God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
but if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
moreover , brethren , I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you , which also ye have received , and wherein ye stand ;
by which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
after that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
for I am the least of the Apostles , that am not meet to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
but if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
and if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
and if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
but now is Christ risen from the dead , and become the firstfruits of them that slept .
for as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive .
then cometh the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
and when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we die .
awake to righteousness , and sin not ; for some have not the knowledge of God : I speak this to your shame .
and that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
all flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
there are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
there is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
it is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
it is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . there is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
the first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the Lord from heaven .
as is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
and as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory .
but thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
now concerning the collection for the saints , as I have given order to the churches of Galatia , even so do ye .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
and when I come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem .
and if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
now I will come unto you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
for I will not see you now by the way ; but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
as touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
and whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
and our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
for we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life :
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
but as God is true , our word toward you was not yea and nay .
now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ;
moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
not for that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
but I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heaviness .
for if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
and I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
but if any have caused grief , he hath not grieved me , but in part : that I may not overcharge you all .
sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inflicted of many .
so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
to whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
for we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :
to the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
do we begin again to commend ourselves ? or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
and not as Moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
but their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in Christ .
therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ;
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
but if our gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost :
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
we are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
for we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
for our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ;
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
for in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven :
if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit .
therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord :
we are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
for the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
and all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
to wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ 's stead , be ye reconciled to God .
we then , as workers together with him , beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain .
( for he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ;
now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?
having therefore these promises , dearly beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
for , when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
Wherefore , though I wrote unto you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you .
therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
for if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
and his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .
for to their power , I bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
Insomuch that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
and herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
for if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
but thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
and we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us :
providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
whether any do inquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be inquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
for as touching the ministering to the saints , it is superfluous for me to write to you :
yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
but this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
and by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
( for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ;
do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ 's , even so are we Christ 's .
for though I should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed :
that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
but we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ :
not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man 's line of things made ready to our hand .
for I am Jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely ?
as the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
that which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
for ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
in journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
if I must needs glory , I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities .
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
in Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me :
it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
for though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a Thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
for this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
and he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ 's sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
truly the signs of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
I desired Titus , and with him I sent a brother . did Titus make a gain of you ? walked we not in the same spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?
this is the third time I am coming to you . in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established .
since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me , which to you @-@ ward is not weak , but is mighty in you .
for though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
but I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates .
now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
for we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection .
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the communion of the Holy ghost , be with you all . Amen .
grace be to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father :
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
but though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
as we said before , so say I now again , If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed .
but I certify you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man .
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
and profited in the Jews ' religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me ; but I went into Arabia , and returned again unto Damascus .
now the things which I write unto you , behold , before God , I lie not .
and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ :
but neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
to whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
but of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man 's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
but contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ;
( for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles : )
only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
but if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
for if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
for I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ?
he therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
Brethren , I speak after the manner of men ; Though it be but a man 's Covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto .
and this I say , that the Covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , cannot disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
for if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
but before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
there is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;
Wherefore thou art no more a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
but now , after that ye have known God , or rather are known of God , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements , whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ?
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first .
where is then the blessedness ye spake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you .
I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
for it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh ; but he of the freewoman was by promise .
which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar .
for this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
but Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
now we , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise .
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit , even so it is now .
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
for I testify again to every man that is circumcised , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
for , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
but if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye cannot do the things that ye would .
but if ye be led of the Spirit , ye are not under the law .
but the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , Goodness , faith ,
if we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
Brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an one in the spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou also be tempted .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting .
and let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
but God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
from henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
Paul , an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints which are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus :
grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ :
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself :
that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth ; even in him :
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
in whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
and hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus :
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
for we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
that at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
and came and preached peace to you which were afar off , and to them that were nigh .
now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellowcitizens with the saints , and of the household of God ;
and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward :
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery ; ( as I wrote afore in few words ,
whereby , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ )
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit ;
Whereof I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power .
to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God ,
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
I therefore , the prisoner of the Lord , beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called ,
endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things . )
and he gave some , Apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , Evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
for the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
that we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
but speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Christ :
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
if so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in Jesus :
and that ye put on the new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness .
let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
and grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice :
but fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ;
for this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
for ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
( for the fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
for the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
for we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
honour THY father and mother ; ( which is the first commandment with promise ; )
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
and for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel ,
for which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul and Timotheus , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
for God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
and this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment ;
but I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
and many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
the one preach Christ of contention , not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds :
what then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
but if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
for I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
and having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
Wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
Yea , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and rejoice with you all .
but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
for all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ 's .
him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
for he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
though I might also have confidence in the flesh . if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
Circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , an Hebrew of the Hebrews ; as touching the law , a Pharisee ;
not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
whose end is destruction , whose God is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things . )
for our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ :
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
let your moderation be known unto all men . the Lord is at hand .
be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God .
and the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus .
finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
but I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
now ye Philippians know also , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
not because I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that may abound to your account .
now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints ,
as ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ ;
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
giving thanks unto the Father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light :
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son :
in whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins :
and he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
and , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
and you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the church :
whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you , and for them at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ;
for though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
rooted and built up in him , and stablished in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with Thanksgiving .
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ :
buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
and you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ;
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
and having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body is of Christ .
if ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
when Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry :
for which things ' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience :
and have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him :
put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ;
Forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
and above all these things put on charity , which is the bond of perfectness .
and let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
and whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
and whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ;
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven .
Withal praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
all my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord :
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ;
Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and Marcus , sister 's son to Barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ; )
and Jesus , which is called Justus , who are of the circumcision . these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God , which have been a comfort unto me .
for I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church which is in his house .
and when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ : grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
for our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
and ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy ghost :
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God @-@ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
for yourselves , brethren , know our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain :
but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the Apostles of Christ .
so being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
for ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
for what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?
for verily , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tribulation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
for what thanks can we render to God again for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God ;
night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
for this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter : because that the Lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .
he therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but God , who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit .
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without , and that ye may have lack of nothing .
but I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep .
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the Archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
but of the times and the seasons , brethren , ye have no need that I write unto you .
Ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
therefore let us not sleep , as do others ; but let us watch and be sober .
for they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night .
but let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
and we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . and be at peace among yourselves .
now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
see that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
in every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
we are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and Tribulations that ye endure :
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
remember ye not , that , when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
and then shall that Wicked be revealed , whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming :
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
Whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may have free course , and be glorified , even as it is with you :
and we have confidence in the Lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
for even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned :
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
and I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
now unto the King eternal , Immortal , invisible , the only wise God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
who will have all men to be saved , and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an Apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
but I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
for Adam was first formed , then Eve .
a bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
and let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
for bodily exercise profiteth little : but godliness is profitable unto all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach , because we trust in the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , specially of those that believe .
let no man despise THY youth ; but be thou an example of the believers , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity .
neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ;
but if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
and withal they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
if any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid .
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
for the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not highminded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eternal life .
I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
greatly desiring to see thee , being mindful of THY tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in THY grandmother Lois , and THY mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
for God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind .
be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner : but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God ;
Whereunto I am appointed a preacher , and an Apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
this thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
but , when he was in Rome , he sought me out very diligently , and found me .
the Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
Thou therefore , my son , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus .
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
it is a faithful saying : for if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him :
of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
and their word will eat as doth a canker : of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth ; and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
if a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will .
traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
all scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears ;
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables .
I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith :
for Demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and is departed unto Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus unto Dalmatia .
only Luke is with me . take Mark , and bring him with thee : for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
the cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
do THY diligence to come before winter . Eubulus greeteth thee , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brethren .
but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching , which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour ;
to Titus , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre 's sake .
this witness is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
the aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ;
to speak evil of no man , to be no brawlers , but gentle , shewing all meekness unto all men .
that being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing be wanting unto them .
Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
that the communication of THY faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
Wherefore , though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient ,
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
having confidence in THY obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
but withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
there salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ;
God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
for unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? and again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
and again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
but unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of THY kingdom .
and , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and THY years shall not fail .
but to which of the angels said he at any time , sit on my right hand , until I make thine enemies THY footstool ?
are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
God also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the Holy ghost , according to his own will ?
for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come , whereof we speak .
Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of THY hands :
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
saying , I will declare THY name unto my brethren , in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee .
for verily he took not on him the nature of angels ; but he took on him the seed of Abraham .
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succour them that are tempted .
for this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house .
for every house is builded by some man ; but he that built all things is God .
and Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
but Christ as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end .
Wherefore ( as the Holy ghost saith , To day if ye will hear his voice ,
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , They do alway err in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God .
for we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
for some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
but with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for we which have believed do enter into rest , as he said , As I have sworn in my wrath , if they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
for he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
for the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee .
though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ;
and being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ;
of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing .
for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end :
and so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
for this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
and verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham :
and here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
and as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham .
for the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
for the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
for such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
for if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law :
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant , which was established upon better promises .
for if that first Covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
for finding fault with them , he saith , behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more .
in that he saith , A new Covenant , he hath made the first old . now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary .
for there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
which had the golden censer , and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tables of the Covenant ;
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
the Holy ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
but Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
for if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
for where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
for a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
for then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
then said he , Lo , I come to do THY will , O God . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
but this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
Whereof the Holy ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
for we know him that hath said , vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . and again , The Lord shall judge his people .
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
but call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
for ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
by faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
for he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
but now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
by faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered up Isaac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
by faith Jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
by faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
by faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ;
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
by faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
by faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
they were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
( of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
but if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ;
looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
and this word , Yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remain .
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear :
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
for the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
but I beseech you the rather to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting Covenant ,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
and I beseech you , brethren , suffer the word of exhortation : for I have written a letter unto you in few words .
know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . they of Italy salute you .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad , greeting .
if any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed .
let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted :
blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God cannot be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
but every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
for he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a Forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
if any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man 's religion is vain .
pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
my brethren , have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory , with respect of persons .
Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
for he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
for he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
was not Abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
for as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
for every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of Serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
Therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . my brethren , these things ought not so to be .
can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ? either a vine , figs ? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
from whence come wars and fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
go to now , ye rich men , weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you .
your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
Ye have condemned and killed the just ; and he doth not resist you .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door .
take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
and he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations :
whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory :
receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
but as he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of conversation ;
and if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man 's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently :
being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever .
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
to whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
for so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
for what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
for even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps :
who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands :
not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
let him eschew evil , and do good ; let him seek peace , and ensue it .
for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil .
and who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
but and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
for it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
as every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
but rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ 's sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
if ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
but let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters .
yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ?
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing , as unto a faithful Creator .
and when the chief shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time :
be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
but the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
the church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .
greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
Simon Peter , a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
for if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
but he that lacketh these things is blind , and cannot see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
and this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy ghost .
and many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
for if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
and spared not the old world , but saved Noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
( for that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ; )
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
having eyes full of adultery , and that cannot cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; Cursed children :
which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
these are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
while they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , The dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire .
that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
for this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
but the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
but , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the Lord is not Slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us @-@ ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
and account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
( for the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
and these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
if we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
my little children , these things write I unto you , that ye sin not . and if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous :
and he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
and hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
he that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
but whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
he that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
and the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
they went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
but ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? he is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
he that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
in this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . and wherefore slew he him ? because his own works were evil , and his brother 's righteous .
we know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . he that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
but whoso hath this world 's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
my little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
and hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
and this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . and hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the Spirit which he hath given us .
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God :
and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
we are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .
in this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
no man hath seen God at any time . if we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
Hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his Spirit .
and we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us . God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
if a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
by this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .
for this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
this is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . and it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy ghost : and these three are one .
if we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
and this is the record , that God hath given to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
he that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life .
these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
and this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us :
and if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
we know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
for the truth 's sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoiced greatly that I found of THY children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
and now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
and this is love , that we walk after his commandments . this is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
if there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
for I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
which have borne witness of THY charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . he that doeth good is of God : but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee :
Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called :
I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
and the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
yet Michael the Archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
Woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
these are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men 's persons in admiration because of advantage .
keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
the revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . even so , Amen .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
his head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
and his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
and when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . and he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last :
I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ;
I know THY works , and THY labour , and THY patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are Apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars :
and hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove THY candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
I know THY works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
and to the angel of the church in Pergamos write ; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges ;
repent ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
and unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
I know THY works , and charity , and service , and faith , and THY patience , and THY works ; and the last to be more than the first .
behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know THY works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found THY works perfect before God .
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
he that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
I know THY works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before THY feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take THY crown .
and unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
so then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
and immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an Emerald .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven spirits of God .
and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
and the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
and no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
and I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
and I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
and I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
saying with a loud voice , worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
and the four beasts said , Amen . and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals , and I heard , as it were the noise of Thunder , one of the four beasts saying , Come and see .
and I saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
and when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . and I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
and the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
and said to the mountains and rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the lamb :
and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
and I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
saying , Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads .
and I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and cried with a loud voice , saying , salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the lamb .
and all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
saying , Amen : blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and Thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen .
and I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the lamb .
therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
they shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
and when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
and I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
and the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
and the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
the first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
and the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
and the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
and the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
and he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the Scorpions of the earth have power .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
and they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
and they had tails like unto Scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
and they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
and the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
and the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
and thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
for their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto Serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
and there was given me a Reed like unto a rod : and the angel stood , saying , Rise , and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and them that worship therein .
but the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
and I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
these are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
and after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the Ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars :
and she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death .
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
and the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
and the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
and the beast which I saw was like unto a Leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast : and they worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like unto the beast ? who is able to make war with him ?
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
and it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
if any man have an ear , let him hear .
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
and he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
here is wisdom . let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six .
and I looked , and , lo , a lamb stood on the mount Sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their foreheads .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great Thunder : and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps :
and in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
and there followed another angel , saying , Babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
and I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , thrust in THY sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
and the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
and I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God .
and after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
and the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels , Go your ways , and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
and I heard the angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
and men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , It is done .
and there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials , and talked with me , saying unto me , Come hither ; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters :
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
and upon her forehead was a name written , mystery , BABYLON the great , the mother of HARLOTS and ABOMINATIONS of the Earth .
and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .
and the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
and the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
for God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will , and to agree , and give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
and the woman which thou sawest is that great city , which reigneth over the kings of the earth .
and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ; and the earth was lightened with his glory .
and he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
and I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
reward her even as she rewarded you , and double unto her double according to her works : in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double .
therefore shall her plagues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire : for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her .
and the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , Alas , alas , that great city Babylon , that mighty city ! for in one hour is THY judgment come .
and the fruits that THY soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
the merchants of these things , which were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing ,
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for THY merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by THY sorceries were all nations deceived .
and in her was found the blood of prophets , and of saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth .
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
and I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
his eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , King of Kings , and Lord of lords .
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
and I saw an angel come down from heaven , having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
and he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . this is the first resurrection .
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and when the thousand years are expired , Satan shall be loosed out of his prison ,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
and they went up on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city : and fire came down from God out of heaven , and devoured them .
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
and I John saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away .
and he said unto me , It is done . I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely .
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the bride , the lamb 's wife .
and had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names written thereon , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
on the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
and he that talked with me had a golden Reed to measure the city , and the gates thereof , and the wall thereof .
and the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the Reed , twelve thousand furlongs . the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
and he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
and the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the lamb is the light thereof .
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it .
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb .
and there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and they shall see his face ; and his name shall be in their foreheads .
and there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light : and they shall reign for ever and ever .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
he that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .
and , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
and the Spirit and the bride say , Come . and let him that heareth say , Come . and let him that is athirst come . and whosoever will , let him take the water of life freely .
for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
