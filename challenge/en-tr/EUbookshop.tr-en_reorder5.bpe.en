pre@@ face he competition policy pursu@@ ed by the European Commission has a direct impact on th@@ ed@@ a@@ ily life of the citizens of the European Union .
whether they be consumers , sa@@ vers , users of public services , employees or taxpayers , the Union 's citizens enjoy the fru@@ its of the competition policy in the@@ various aspects of their everyday life .
Re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing@@ firms to compete with each other fos@@ ters innovation , redu@@ ces production costs , increas@@ es@@ economic efficiency and , consequently , enhan@@ ces the competitiveness of the European economy , particularly vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis its main trading partners .
the propag@@ ation of th@@ ec@@ om@@ peti@@ tive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabri@@ c of the internal market and , in so doing , provides clear back @@@ -@@ @ up to employment policies .
aid is in principle prohibited by the Treaty if , by favour@@ ing certain firms , it is li@@ able to cause damage to their competitors in other M@@ ember States , which in some cas@@ es@@ might go as far as to jeopardise their very survival and , consequently , the jobs of their
only if aid is justified by the existence of a Community interest will the Com@@ mission@@ grant exem@@ ption from this general principle of prohibi@@ tion .
in some cases , State aid mer@@ ely leads to activities which no longer meet the requirements of economic efficiency being maintained arti@@ fic@@ ially , or to competition with efficient firms in the same sector being dist@@ or@@ ted .
I have asked for the establishment of an aid register list@@ ing@@ all of the Commission 's decisions concerning State aid , and of a sco@@ re@@ board which would enab@@ le@@ it to be seen whether M@@ ember States are comp@@ lying with the State aid rules .
I am convinced that transparency will enable the public and it@@ s@@ representatives to become more involved in aid @@@ -@@ @ monitoring policy .
it enhan@@ ces the quality and variety of good@@ sp@@ la@@ ced on the market , fos@@ ters technological innovation and economic performance and , finally , promotes fair prices for users .
it also seeks to preserve and stimulate their ability to operate on them@@ ar@@ ket in such a way as to contribute to the competitive process .
in conclusion , the Commission and its departments responsible for competition encourage the@@ active participation of consumers and their organisations .
given their knowledge of the day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day functioning of markets , in particular those in mass @@@ -@@ @ market consumer goods , consum@@ er@@ organisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact .
such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which dist@@ ort competition .
economic freedom , within a proper regulatory framework , is a precondition for the development of a free society .
it imp@@ acts not only on the economic environment but also on the organisation of@@ society at large .
it is in this way that competition policy is a " people 's " policy .
the Community 's competition policy pursu@@ es a precise goal , which is to defend@@ and develop effective competi@@ tion@@ in the common market .
demand seeks the@@ best rati@@ o between quality and pri@@ ce@@ for the products it requires . the mos@@ te@@ fficient response emer@@ ges as a result of a contest between suppliers .
thus , competition leads everybody individually to seek out the means of striking th@@ is@@ balance between quality and price in order to meet demand to the best possible
extent . competition is therefore a simple and effici@@ ent@@ means of guarante@@ eing consumers a level of exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce@@ in terms of the quality and price of products and@@ services .
this consol@@ i@@ dates the Community 's industrial and commercial fabri@@ c so that itis able to conf@@ ront the competitiveness of our main@@ partners and to put Community firms in a position tos@@ uc@@ ce@@ ed in markets around the world .
on the bas@@ is@@ of this body of law , competition policy focuses on four main areas of action .
• The control of mer@@ gers between firms ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . a mer@@ ger between two large group@@ s@@ which results in their domin@@ ating the market ) .
• The monitoring of State aid ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . the prohibi@@ tion of a State grant designed to keep@@ a loss @@@ -@@ @ making firm in business even though it has no prospect of recovery ) .
it does not enter into play until such time@@ as trade between M@@ ember States is aff@@ ec@@ ted@@ by the practices in question .
Fo@@ re@@ x@@ amp@@ le , a price @@@ -@@ @ fixing agreement between Bak@@ ers in a given town will not ha@@ ve@@ any impact on the Community market , and European law is therefore not@@ applic@@ able to this kind of situation .
in some cases , this power is shared with the M@@ ember States " own competi@@ tion@@ authorities and law courts ( articles 81 and 82 ) , while in others it li@@ es@@ exclu@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ with the Commission ( mer@@ ger control , monitoring of State aid ) .
by contrast , it is exclusive when the legislative provision in@@ question expres@@ s@@ ly stipulates that this is the case .
for the control of large @@@ -@@ @ scal@@ emer@@ gers , the M@@ ember States considered it necessary to create a one @@@ -@@ @ stop shop@@ .@@ They appointed the European Commission to that end .
finally , it should be added that most M@@ ember States have their own dome@@ sti@@ cla@@ w@@ s@@ to counter anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practices ( restric@@ tive agreements , abuses of ad@@ omin@@ ant position , and mer@@ gers ) .
in the area of its anti @@@ -@@ @ tru@@ st@@ operations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibi@@ tan agreement or@@ to issue an in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion@@ that a restric@@ tive practice be stopped , but also to im@@ pos@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ on firms found guilty of anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive conduct .
the amount of th@@ es@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ is calculated according to the gra@@ vity and dur@@ ation of the inf@@ r@@ ing@@ em@@ ent@@ .@@ Some of the most serious practices are price car@@ tels or ab@@ u@@ sive conduct by fir@@ m@@ sh@@ ol@@ ding a virtual monopoly .
an appeal against a Commission decision may be lo@@ d@@ ged with the Court of First In@@ stance or the Court of Justice of the European Commun@@ ities .
the most famili@@ ar@@ example is an agreement on prices , or car@@ tel , where@@ by firms fix price lev@@ el@@ s@@ jointly so that consumers are unable to take advantage of competition bet@@ we@@ en@@ suppliers to obtain competitive prices .
forms of distribution . in those circumstances , enterprises no longer have to be real@@ ly@@ competitive and have no incentive to innov@@ ate or reduce production costs .
the crisis thus affects employees , sub@@ contractors and tr@@ ad@@ er@@ s.@@ Mo@@ reover , arti@@ fic@@ ially high prices affect the costs of inter@@ mediate consumers , who are adver@@ sely affected by their suppliers " anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive behaviour .
the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive behaviour of a few firms thus har@@ ms all operators and@@ justi@@ fies the intervention of the authorities .
if an agreement fulfil@@ s the following conditions , it is vo@@ id : it is concluded between firms or " under@@ tak@@ ings " ;
l@@ ast@@ ly , it may apply discrimin@@ atory conditions to firms that are not parties to the agreement , placing them at ac@@ om@@ peti@@ tive dis@@ advantage .
under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exemp@@ ted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distribu@@ tion@@ agreements for example .
in this case , the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practice har@@ med firms outside the car@@ tel , which were system@@ atically exclu@@ de@@ d@@ from calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
the result of th@@ is@@ agreement , for the final consumer , was purchase prices that were higher than@@ they would have been with free competition .
after the new venture has been set up , businesses such as@@ banks , super@@ markets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers inter@@ active services via television . access to the services will be through a de@@ co@@ der .
in this case , the Com@@ mission@@ sought to make it easier for new digital inter@@ active television services to develop@@ while at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market .
efficient businesses are run with a view to conqu@@ ering markets , to the poin@@ t@@ where they may establish very strong positions indeed .
citizens have good reason to be appre@@ hensive of abuses of this kind , wh@@ ich@@ result in higher prices , restrictions on the avail@@ ability of products and services and unfair trading conditions .
article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibi@@ ts the abuse of a dominant position . for the article to apply , the following conditions must be fulfilled .
abuse of a dominant position on the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies
the abuse cons@@ isted of@@ establishing a system of brand lo@@ yal@@ ty , which meant that the market in air@@ transport services provided by travel agencies was closed to British Airways '@@ competitors .
the effect of the system was to@@ reinforce agencies " brand lo@@ yal@@ ty to British Air@@ w@@ ay@@ s@@ and to dis@@ courage them from offering the services of
the Commission therefore considered that this practice , which affected the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies , constitu@@ ted an abuse of a dominant position .
abuse of a dominant position in the organisation of the Football World Cup
on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Fren@@ ch@@ committee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 199@@ 8.@@ The committee , the C@@ F@@ O , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event th@@ at@@ included ticket sales .
the Commission found that the arrangements for tic@@ ket@@ sales for the final matches were discrimin@@ atory and constitu@@ ted an abuse of ad@@ omin@@ ant position .
persons not resident in France who w@@ ished to see the final@@ s@@ were thus at a sever@@ ed@@ is@@ advantage compared with@@ persons resident in Fran@@ ce@@ .@@ The Commission there@@ for@@ er@@ uled against the C@@ F@@ O .
Mer@@ gers which create or strengthen a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position , however , are prohibited by the Treaty in@@ order to prevent ensu@@ ing abuses . a firm is in ad@@ omin@@ ant position when it is able to act on them@@ ar@@ ket without having to take account of there@@ action of its competitors , suppliers or@@ customers .
for example , such a firm can increas@@ e@@ its prices above those of its competitors with@@ out@@ fearing any loss of profit .
all market players ande@@ spec@@ ially consumers stand to lose from the@@ emer@@ gence of this kind of dominant structure , which is likely to result in higher prices , a narro@@ wer choice of goods or scar@@ c@@ it@@ y@@ of innovation .
that is why the European Union has set up an advance vet@@ t@@ ing@@ system for mer@@ gers with a Community dimension that enables it to prohibi@@ t ap@@ lan@@ ned mer@@ ger if necessary .
i@@ den@@ tical systems have been set up in the M@@ ember States for investigating mer@@ gers of national dimension .
it must be bor@@ ne in@@ mind that the Commission 's objective in the mer@@ ger control field is to preserve as@@ itu@@ ation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be agu@@ aran@@ tee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
it may be that , in the short term , efforts to improve the competitiveness of firms by means of mer@@ gers or@@ acquis@@ itions involve restructuring and thus loss of jobs .
the Community dimension of a mer@@ ger or acquisition is@@ assessed using th@@ res@@ holds based on the turnover of the companies invol@@ v@@ ed@@ .@@ The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EU@@ R 5 000 million ) and the Community @@@ -@@ @ wide threshold ( EU@@ R 250 million ) .
• Mer@@ gers and acquis@@ itions with a Community dimension have to be noti@@ fied to the Commission for its agreement before they are put into effect .
since the@@ entry into force of the mer@@ ger regulation , the Commission has seen th@@ en@@ um@@ ber of noti@@ fic@@ ations grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
• After an initial scrutiny period of one month , the Commission decides either to
regulation author@@ ise the trans@@ action or , if it thinks that a dominant position might be created or strengthened , to initiate a four @@@ -@@ @ month investigation procedure .
• At the end of this procedure , the Commission may author@@ ise the mer@@ ger
( more than 90 % ) .
in a market in the process of integration , mer@@ gers wh@@ ich@@ create or strengthen a dominant position are , in fact , quite rare .
In@@ some cases , the mer@@ ger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen ad@@ omin@@ ant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a sol@@ u@@ tion@@ to the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
in both the Finnish and Austrian cases , the Com@@ mission@@ considered that the mer@@ ger of these retail cha@@ ins would have created ad@@ omin@@ ant position ; in the Finnish case , it decided to prohibi@@ t the trans@@ action , while in the Austrian case it accepted the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies , which cons@@ isted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors .
the mer@@ ger of Car@@ re@@ four and Pro@@ mod@@ è@@ s was authorised subject to the@@ div@@ est@@ ment of a maj@@ or@@ sharehol@@ ding in ac@@ om@@ peti@@ tor .
but the@@ analysis of competi@@ tiv@@ ec@@ on@@ di@@ tions at lo@@ cal@@ level was left to th@@ en@@ ational competi@@ tion@@ authorities , since th@@ emer@@ ger involved as@@ eries of very lo@@ cal@@ is@@ ed@@ competition problems .
the Commission thus ensured th@@ at@@ competition was@@ preserved or restored in order to allow consumers to continue to benefit from ac@@ ho@@ ice of outlets , attractive prices and a di@@ verse range of consumer goods .
insurance policy@@ hol@@ ders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fro@@ m@@ the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .
it would have given the new firm siz@@ e@@ ab@@ le@@ shares of the market for the supply of various life @@@ -@@ @ assur@@ ance products in Italy .
in addition , the investigation revealed links between the two firms and the@@ ir@@ main competitors that could have indu@@ ced them to co@@ ordinate their behavi@@ our@@ in the insurance and investment fields .
the mer@@ ging of the@@ operations of the two main players in the French pet@@ ro@@ leum products sector wo@@ ul@@ d@@ have created a dominant position on@@ several markets . after the mer@@ ger , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina
the mer@@ ging of the@@ operations of the tw@@ om@@ ain players in the French pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ products sector wo@@ ul@@ d@@ have created a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position on sever@@ al@@ markets .
furthermore , the combination of To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina and el@@ f service stations on French motor@@ ways would have given the new group a market share of some 60 % .
the Commission considered that this level of market power would have pus@@ h@@ ed@@ up prices in a market where they were already high .
l@@ ast@@ ly , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina and El@@ f@@ would have become the leader on the market for L@@ P@@ G , used for heating . in or@@ der@@ to resolve the competition problems identified , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina / el@@ f under@@ took to sell alar@@ ge pro@@ portion of the operations concerned to competitors .
in this way , the Commission ensured that the French fuel markets remain@@ ed@@ competitive and that consumers continued to benefit from the supply of@@ pet@@ ro@@ leum products at fair prices .
however , the special rights must not go beyond what is necessary for the performance of that service .
otherwise , from the point of view of Community law , they would cre@@ a@@ tes@@ itu@@ ations that restric@@ t competition .
the public authorities in the M@@ ember States may gr@@ ant@@ special rights , in particul@@ ar@@ monopoly rights , to public or@@ private under@@ tak@@ ings top@@ er@@ form services of general@@ economic interest .
in these sectors , a distinc@@ tion must be made between the@@ infrastructure and the services provided over@@ this infrastructure .
while it is often difficult to@@ establish a second , competing infrastructure , for reasons linked to investment costs ande@@ con@@ om@@ ic efficiency , it is possible and desi@@ rab@@ le@@ to create competitive conditions in respect of@@ the services provided .
the process of opening up these sectors to@@ competition has a positi@@ ve@@ impact for inter@@ medi@@ ate@@ users , and also for final@@ consumers .
in a sector of the economy which is experi@@ en@@ cin@@ grap@@ id growth driven by the emer@@ gence of the Internet and of electron@@ ic@@ commerce , the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source of@@ competitiveness and new jobs .
depending on the circumstances , it may itself adopt a European liberalisation direc@@ tive , or propose that such a direc@@ tive be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament .
a direc@@ tive is a piece of Community legislation which sets a common objective to be at@@ tained by all M@@ ember States , one that each M@@ ember State will incorpor@@ ate
EU@@ R 5@@ 10 million for the right to operate on the Spanish market , while Tele@@ f@@ ó@@ nica , the State operator , had been allowed to provide mobile telephone services without
advantage over its new competi@@ tor , enabling it tos@@ tr@@ eng@@ then its dominant position on the mobil@@ e@@ telephony market .
the Commission decided that there was no necessary relation bet@@ we@@ en@@ the stated cultural policy objective of preserving plur@@ alism in the F@@ le@@ mis@@ h prin@@ ted@@ press and the granting in F@@ lan@@ ders of a monopoly on commercial television to V@@ T@@ M .
Un@@ subsidis@@ ed firms can even run in@@ to@@ difficulties that will impact on their competitiveness and ability to keep the@@ i@@ re@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in jobs .
ultimately , then , the entire market will suffer from State aid , and the general competitiveness of the European economy is im@@ per@@ il@@ led .
the Commission 's monitoring of State aid has a considerable impact on day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day life and offers three main beneficial effects .
by prev@@ ent@@ ing@@ dist@@ or@@ tions of in@@ tra @@@ -@@ @ Community competition that would be dele@@ ter@@ ious to th@@ es@@ ing@@ le market , it boos@@ ts economic growth in the Union and promo@@ tes@@ employment as a result .
aid can take a variety of forms : grants and interest relief , of course , but also tax@@ relief .
aid can be given in the form of a State guarantee or holding , or even@@ provision by the State of goods and services on preferential terms .
- promote culture and heritage conserv@@ ation ; where , in the last two cases , such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common
the Commission has adopted a number of documents to clar@@ ify its State aid policy .
they concern regions lagging behind in terms of development , R & D , employment and training , small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized businesses , protection of the environment and the rescue and and 88 restructuring of firms in difficulty .
the Commission generally takes a favourable approach to such sch@@ e@@ mes as long as they do not dist@@ ort competition to an ex@@ t@@ ent@@ in@@ compatible with the common interest .
it is@@ often ap@@ prised of such sch@@ e@@ mes via complaints from firms . in@@ compatible sch@@ e@@ mes@@ are banned , and the off@@ ending M@@ ember State may well be required to rec@@ over th@@ es@@ ums paid out .
certain forms of State financial support for firms can be an@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary means of tackling structural han@@ dic@@ aps and exc@@ ess costs flow@@ ing fro@@ m@@ location in such areas .
the objective of this aid is to help alleviate or even@@ remove a number of problems ( employment , development , et@@ c . ) facing certain@@ urban areas .
it ac@@ ted@@ with the t@@ wo@@ fold concern to preserve a company in@@ the process of return to vi@@ ability on the air transpor@@ t@@ market without jeopardis@@ ing competition : consum@@ er@@ s@@ would benefit both from Al@@ ital@@ ia 's services and from those of its competitors .
the effect of this balanced policy is to preserve competitiveness an@@ dem@@ plo@@ yment throughout the common market for the benefit of all th@@ os@@ e@@ employed in the motor industry .
in my local area , there are on@@ ly@@ two large super@@ markets , each belonging to one of the t@@ wo@@ cha@@ ins in question .
at the moment , there is keen competi@@ tion@@ between the two super@@ markets in prices and promotional offer@@ s.@@ A@@ m I right in fearing that , after the mer@@ ger , this situation will@@ change and local competition will dis@@ appear ?
community dimension , the domestic competition authorities will as a rule have the power to take similar action .
difference in the price of the same vehicle depending on whether it is bought in my country of residence or in the other M@@ ember State .
my deal@@ er has told me that I could not buy the@@ vehicle abroad as the manufacturer for@@ bids its deal@@ ers fro@@ m@@ making cross @@@ -@@ @ border sales .
petrol prices went up by the same amount on the same day in al@@ l@@ the petrol stations in my region .
it may be the consequence of an increase in tax or in the price of crude oil , for example because of an international crisis .
where there is no explanation of th@@ is@@ kind , it might be that the price rise is the result of an agreement between fil@@ l@@ ing@@ station owners or oil companies .
an investigation would have to be conducted to@@ determine whether or not this was the case .
I usu@@ al@@ ly@@ take a fer@@ ry run by the U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses line , which offers the m@@ ost@@ attractive prices of the three companies operating at the port in question .
the combination of a price rise and the al@@ ign@@ ment of prices between the thre@@ ec@@ om@@ pan@@ ies - the only three operating at the port - would seem to indic@@ ate@@ concer@@ ted action by the three firms .
in the face of red@@ un@@ dan@@ cies , what justi@@ fication is there for the Commission
the firm is going to have to pay@@ back the aid to the government .
however , the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the vi@@ ability of firms . on the contrary , the goal is to ensure that firms rec@@ over a lasting vit@@ ality .
thus , aid granted to a firm in order temporarily to save its business and the jobs it provides may cause difficulties for several firms and thousands of workers that receive no government aid .
however , the Commission is in favour of aid for the restructuring of firms in difficulty , provided that it leads to the long @@@ -@@ @ term restoration of the firms " competitiveness .
private firms have different objectives from public@@ services and I am afraid that the quest for profit may promp@@ t@@ these firms to abandon un@@ profitable activities or to be les@@ s@@ rigor@@ ous on matters of safety and public health .
in some sectors , for example air transport and telecommunications , liber@@ alis@@ ation@@ has clearly brought benefits to consumers , in terms of prices and the services on offer , without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
X services in geo@@ graph@@ ically remote areas .
so the public has gained agre@@ at deal from the policy of liberalisation : lower prices , a wider range of services , more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny .

regional development : an important step towards

in this article we look at how the original pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance has taken on new dimen@@ sions .
investment was implemented through the In@@ str@@ ument for
( 1 ) e legal basis for this assistance is Council Regula@@ tion ( EC ) No 10@@ 85 / 2006 , adopted on 17 July 2006 .
candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU M@@ ember States and regions under Co@@ hesion Policy instruments .
a significant share of IPA funds managed by the DG@@ s for Regional Policy and Employment are allocated to Lisbon @@@ -@@ @ type expendi@@ ture ( roughly 15 to 20 % of the overall programme allocation , depending on the country ) .
components III , I@@ V and V are open to candidate countries only ( name@@ ly the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
their design mir@@ r@@ ors closely the management and programming principles of structural , co@@ hesion and rural development funds .
by gaining first @@@ -@@ @ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absor@@ b future structural , co@@ hesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
in this relatively short period ( programme preparations and negotiations took less than a year ) , essential preconditions and principles for successful implementation were agreed .
a quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Com@@ pon@@ ent III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
investment aid in candidate countries is only a frac@@ tion of the level of investment assistance available to M@@ ember Sta@@ tes@@ 2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in dev@@ ising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of St@@ ruc@@ tural Fund programmes .
the project will serve a population of approximately 4@@ 44 000 inhabitants
as a result of the Regional Development component of pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance , a prec@@ ur@@ sor to the St@@ ruc@@ tural and Co@@ hesion F@@ unds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
one of the main objectives of the Regional Development operational programme is to contribute to sustainable development and the regional integration of the country into the Western Balkans .
heavy pollution caused by non @@@ -@@ @ treated waste water , as well as non @@@ -@@ @ treated urban and industrial water , is however a real threat for sustainable development and the quality of life for the inhabitants .
is article focuses on the first of these elements , which will support up to 12 programmes between the M@@ ember States and ( potential ) candidate countries ( see map ) .
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a ge@@ ar through pre @@@ -@@ @ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Sec@@ re@@ tariat staff@@ ed from both sides of the border .
in this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river bas@@ ins like the Danube and T@@ is@@ za , could be developed in the IPA cross@@ border programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , cross@@ border area .
finally , there is another lay@@ er of benefits that should also be taken into account - these can be described as the institutional benefits for the ( potential ) candidate countries .
in line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds implementation , the IPA cross@@ border programmes will mir@@ ror St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds rules as closely as pos@@ si@@ ble@@ . is means fir@@ st@@ ly that the programmes are run on a multi@@ annual basis .

although starting up while Bulgaria was still a candidate for accession , the projects continued as planned , after the country had become a member of the EU .
it was not only the status of the country in its relation to the EU that under@@ went a change - the funding instrument changed its name , becoming the In@@ str@@ ument for P@@ re @@@ -@@ @ Accession Assistance ( IPA ) .

in this last phase of pre @@@ -@@ @ accession , Croatian SM@@ E@@ s are generally still finding it difficult to maintain competitiveness .

Prof@@ . D@@ r Y@@ av@@ uz C@@ AB@@ B@@ A@@ R , He@@ ad of Oper@@ ating St@@ ruc@@ ture at the Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade , explains how the economy is developing through the 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2010 Oper@@ ational Programme of the IPA .
geo@@ graph@@ ically , the Programme concent@@ rates on the regions where income per capita is below 75 % of the Turkish national
average ( 12 N@@ U@@ T@@ S@@ 1 II Regi@@ ons ) .
within these regions , there is a strong focus on the 15 Growth Cent@@ res which have been identified in the Strategic co@@ her@@ ence Framework .
it then attribu@@ tes a competitiveness index for each region by applying a co@@ efficient to each on@@ e@@ . e result is a map showing differing levels of competitiveness between regi@@ on@@ s@@ . is is then col@@ our co@@ ded into five groups , where the ligh@@ test sha@@ de represents the lowest level of competitiveness .
on the next graphic , the Com@@ peti@@ tiveness M@@ ap has been modi@@ fied to show solely the target regions of the RC@@ O@@ P and three groups of regions with a similar level of competitiveness .
it has been difficult , but all the pieces are now in place for some exc@@ iting economic developments , as well as providing the tools for evalu@@ ating future projects under the IPA .
in regions with high competitiveness , the measures are targeted at increasing added value , and cop@@ ing with
advisory missions were carried out to provide assistance to the Croatian authorities in building up the necessary institutional , management and control capacities .
e conclusion of the ver@@ ification au@@ dit is that the overall system for the management and control of IPA program is comp@@ li@@ ant with the requirements .

e first programme to be approved by the European Commission on 14 December 2007 was between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
a wide variety of projects were successfully implemented under the Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood Programme .
here are just a couple of examples among many .
aside from the form@@ ality of the measures , it 's encouraging to think of real people coming together from different organisations and communities with common goals to achieve .
joint activities were introduced in the sp@@ here of health protection and improving the quality of life of young people in the cross@@ border region .
economic gains by themselves would be hol@@ low if they did not also ensure sustainable growth and the preservation and development of natural and cultural resources , which constitute key assets in this border region .
e real start of the programme - the first call for proposals - will be launched during the last quarter of 2008 , when applicants will be able to send their project proposals to the programme secre@@ tariat in Ky@@ ust@@ en@@ dil .

participants agreed that measuring the impact of EU activities and also the effectiveness of public@@ ity measures via public surveys is one of the most objective meth@@ od@@ s@@ 5. e surveys , accompanied by analysis , also draw lessons for the more efficient promotion of EU structural interven@@ tions .
it began with a presentation by Anna Bug@@ al@@ ska ( Ministry for Regional Development , Poland ) of the camp@@ ain " Poland Gro@@ wing Be@@ autiful ! e " S@@ even mir@@ ac@@ les of EU funds " competition , " which provided the basis for discussion and raised various questions .

a number of recent initiatives reflect that quality control in education is an important issue on the political agenda of the European Commission as well as in many European countries .
within the Lisbon process , enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in Europe is one of the three main goals to be achieved in the period up to 2010 .
in this context , the European Commission has set up an expert group on " Im@@ proving the Education of Te@@ ach@@ ers and tra@@ in@@ ers . "
the group has identified the development of systems for the evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the initial and in@@ service education of teachers as one of the priorities involved in improving teacher education .
concern for quality assur@@ ance in teacher education is closely linked to the broader context of the development of higher education and the follow@@ up of the Bologna Process .
they should also commit themselves exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assur@@ ance , in their work . "
in light of the Lisbon and Bologna processes , the European Commission asked Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce in the autumn of 2004 to carry out a study on regulations for the evaluation of teacher education in European countries .
the present compar@@ ative study carried out with reference to the rep@@ lies obtained from these questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res , has been commented on and checked by the 30 Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce Network member countries ( 1 ) .
they describe the various players involved , as well as their qualifications , the documents which have to be used in identi@@ fying criteria , the focus and procedures of evaluation and its frequ@@ ency .
however , the extent to which such evaluation procedures are regulated may differ from one country to the next .
if information is available on current quality assur@@ ance practices , it is provided in the appropriate sections of this report .
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
it may provide either a basis for reform or an evaluation of newly implemented reforms , as shown in the examples below .
in the United Kingdom ( Wal@@ es ) , a review of the provision of initial teacher education on behalf of the Wel@@ sh Assembly Government has been under@@ way since 2005 .
this looks at how a certain aspect of initial teacher education is being dealt with across the whole of the system , rather than just within a specific institution .
in 24 countries or regions , only general regulations for the evaluation of all higher education apply to the evaluation of teacher education ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1.1 ) .
apart from the legislative framework for the evaluation or accredi@@ tation of higher education , no specific evaluation systems are ge@@ ar@@ ed to teacher education .
in Germany , specific regulations apply solely to the evaluation of the final " on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ job " qualifying ( indu@@ ction ) phase , which is organised by the teacher training institu@@ tes ( Stu@@ di@@ en@@ semin@@ are ) .
in Poland , teacher education provided by universities is evalu@@ ated in accordance with general regulations for quality control in higher education , whereas specific regulations apply in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
in England , Wal@@ es and Northern Ireland , there are separate arrangements , established by law , for the school inspec@@ tor@@ ates to evaluate programmes of initial teacher education .
additional notes Belgium ( B@@ E de ) : the figure rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
General regulations apply to the evaluation of all higher education ( including initial teacher education ) .
as will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evalu@@ ations are often very closely inter@@ related ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
in several countries , regulations provide for more than one evaluation procedure , including external and / or internal evaluation . there are various reasons for this : different components or stages of education
however , in 2001 , the university requested the European University Association to organise an institutional quality review , which was repeated in 2004 .
evaluation undertaken by bodies or persons not directly involved in the activities of the particular programme or institution concerned is generally referred to as external evaluation .
this chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evalu@@ ators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it reli@@ es ; the frequ@@ ency of external evaluation .
in Cyprus , Poland ( in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es ) and Iceland , the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for external evaluation .
in Spain , the external evaluation committee has to be well balanced in terms of the training and experience of its members .
legislation on higher education and a list of evaluation criteria are the official sources most often used in the context of external evaluation .
the " guidelines for initial Te@@ acher Education courses " in Scot@@ land give regulations on the requirements for initial teacher education and specify such things as the length of programmes , the amount of school experience and comp@@ ul@@ sory programme elements .
the " Standard for initial Te@@ acher Education : bench@@ mark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have at@@ tained at the end of their programmes .
the E@@ valu@@ ation Framework for the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of Program@@ mes of initial Te@@ acher Education and the Ar@@ ran@@ gements for the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of Program@@ mes of initial Te@@ acher Education give detailed gu@@ idance on how the accredi@@ tation process works .
however , these countries have all adopted lists of criteria , some of which may involve aspects directly relating to teacher education .
in Latvia , for example , the Hig@@ her Education Qu@@ ality E@@ valu@@ ation Centre has developed a questionnaire for evaluation experts , which consists of questions regarding the main quality aspects to be evalu@@ ated .
figure 2.3 : official documents to be used to establish criteria for the external evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
United Kingdom : the information provided rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
the committee will ensure that its interviews with different groups focus on those aspects previously analy@@ sed which have yi@@ elded contra@@ dic@@ tory findings , or which seem especially important , are unclear or are not sufficiently conclu@@ sive .
class@@ room ob@@ servation ( in the institution providing initial teacher education ) can@@ not be regarded as among the main procedures in external evaluation .
figure 2.5 : procedures and mechanisms in the external evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
regular evalu@@ ations for the renewal of accredi@@ tation are then generally planned within a period ranging from three to twelve years after the prec@@ eding evaluation .
Denmark : the Center for Vi@@ der@@ eg@@ å@@ en@@ de Ud@@ d@@ ann@@ else are given the possibility to participate in a single accredi@@ tation process allowing them to obtain the quality la@@ bel of University Col@@ leg@@ es .
Germany : only evalu@@ ations of bac@@ hel@@ or '@@ s@@ - and master 's @@@ -@@ @ type programmes are used for the purpose of accredi@@ tation ( or re @@@ -@@ @ accredi@@ tation ) .
France : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to evaluation carried out by the des ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation carried out by the C@@ NE and the IG@@ A@@ EN@@ R .
this will be applied to institutions for teacher education once they have designed their study programmes according to the Bologna requirements .
this is an excep@@ tional situation linked to the monitoring of the 2001 reform of programmes for initial teacher education ( see chapter 1 ) .
in Wal@@ es , the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspec@@ tions by 2008 , after which a different cycle will be introduced . United Kingdom ( SC@@ T ) : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to evaluation of all higher education institutions ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occur@@ s at regular inter@@ vals and another whose frequ@@ ency var@@ ies .
in Denmark , programme evaluation may be conducted by E@@ va ( Danish E@@ valu@@ ation Institute ) on its own initiative and upon the request of , for example , the government , ministries , advisory boards , local authorities and establis@@ hments .
in Germany , external evaluation is carried out on the initiative of universities and teacher training centres , or the ministry of education in the case of teacher training institu@@ tes ( Stu@@ di@@ en@@ semin@@ are ) ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 4 , Sec@@ tion 4.@@ 1 ) .
the legislation of the different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der states that all external evaluation should be carried out regularly without specif@@ ying its frequ@@ ency .
in Spain , the AN@@ EC@@ A issues a call for applications , annually or every two years , from higher education institutions w@@ ishing to be evalu@@ ated .
the decision whether to submit to evaluation is taken by the head of the institution .
in Austria , external evaluation may be conducted at the request of the universities or the Ministry for Education , Science and Culture .
internal evaluation ( self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation ) of teacher education may B@@ E defined as an evaluation process for which those working in a particular institution or programme are responsible .
internal evaluation offers opportunities for quality enhan@@ cement in so far as it is a collective app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of structures and practices existing within the institution concerned .
an over@@ view of the different kinds of internal evaluation in each country covered by this survey is provided in the an@@ ne@@ x .
in the Czech Republic , Germany ( in the case of teacher training institu@@ tes ) , Poland , Slovenia and Iceland ( for the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions ) , the responsibility for Co@@ ordination lies mainly with the management of the institution .
however , in some L@@ ä@@ n@@ der , it may also include administr@@ ators from the office of teacher training ( Am@@ t f@@ ür Leh@@ r@@ er@@ bil@@ d@@ ung ) or similar institutions in the L@@ ä@@ n@@ der , and staff from the teacher training institu@@ tes to be evalu@@ ated .
in universities in Poland , the teacher education faculty or chair of the university is responsible for internal evaluation .
in teacher training col@@ leg@@ es , internal evaluation is carried out by the colle@@ ge council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the internal evaluation process has to be managed by a specific commission appointed by the rec@@ tor / de@@ an .
in some institutions , there is a special quality manager , while in others quality issues are the responsibility of the governing board or a council .
in Bulgaria , the evaluation committee presents its reports to the governing board of the institution .
Cyprus : the F@@ ig@@ ure rela@@ tes solely to the internal evaluation of col@@ leg@@ es providing initial teacher education for primary educ@@ ation@@ .@@ Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Hungary : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that takes place prior to external evaluation .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
these experts may either act on behalf of the principal or board of the institution , or simply give meth@@ od@@ ological / technical support to the staff responsible for conducting the evaluation .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the fac@@ ul@@ ties or departments concerned .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should cons@@ ist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
it is recommended that committees should have a maximum of seven members .
in Hungary , the committee members are professors and researchers elected by the council of the institution for a period of three years .
the student self @@@ -@@ @ governing body may deleg@@ ate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
in Iceland , the committee should comp@@ rise at least four and no more than six members drawn from faculty staff , students and administration .
chapter 3 -@@ Internal E@@ valu@@ ation of initial Te@@ acher Education
Luxembourg : for secondary education , the general component of teacher education has to be undertaken abroad .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
several countries state that other participants may contribute to internal evaluation , including the institution 's non @@@ -@@ @ academic staff , external stak@@ ehol@@ ders from the business sector or academic life elsewhere , and former gradu@@ ates of the institution .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , it is comp@@ ul@@ sory for people external to the faculty or school offering the programme and for people from outside the institution to take part in the annual evaluation .
in Romania , it is recommended that representatives of the institution 's best gradu@@ ates and of employers should take part in the internal evaluation of P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical university col@@ leg@@ es and universities .
in Malta , for example , all academic staff members are encouraged to conduct an evaluation of their course programme by means of questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res or interviews with their students .
external experts from abroad serving as moder@@ ators are invited to review both the course content and assessed as@@ sign@@ ments . they may also put forward recommendations for possible improvements .
in Slovenia , the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the specific commission appointed by the de@@ an for managing the internal evaluation process should be composed of teachers , administr@@ ators and student representatives .
virtually all of the fore@@ going types of document are used to identify the criteria for internal evaluation in the French Community of Belgium , Greece , Lithuania and Poland .
almost all countries use legislation on higher education to establish the criteria of internal evaluation , always in con@@ jun@@ ction with several of the other documents referred to above .
in almost all cases , the use of such documents is comp@@ ul@@ sory , except in the French Community of Belgium and Romania , where their use is recommended .
the second , the Gu@@ í@@ a de Aut@@ o@@ evalu@@ ac@@ i@@ ó@@ n ( self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation guide ) , is intended to facilitate the start of the sel@@ f@@ evaluation phase .
in Slovakia , the list of criteria developed by the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Committee for purposes of external evaluation and accredi@@ tation is very often used for the internal evaluation of study programmes in general .
while the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is op@@ tional in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , intern@@ ally dev@@ ised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them .
figure 3.3 : official documents to be used to establish criteria for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification fra@@ me@@ works for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom , although there are no specific regulations to this effect , the use of external evaluation results for internal evaluation is expected .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the out@@ comes of the General Te@@ aching Council for Scot@@ land process will in turn fe@@ ed back into the internal quality assur@@ ance processes of the university .
however , there is no exp@@ li@@ cit mention of this having to happen - simply an expec@@ tation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
of the countries with official regulations on the scope of internal evaluation , most cover all ( or almost all ) of the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned issues .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curricul@@ um is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
as well as the quality of teaching , other areas of interest were the organis@@ ational structure , administration , tasks of the department , research , the provision of services , public relations and the development plan .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the course work@@ load and the teachers ' and ass@@ ist@@ ants " ability to deliver the course .
the global reports established on this basis by the department and the faculty are used for ga@@ ug@@ ing how students ' perceptions v@@ ary over time or across discipl@@ ines , and for compar@@ ing student performance .
Latvia : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of a higher education institution for its accredi@@ tation , ( 2 ) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for accredi@@ tation , and ( 3 ) to the internal evaluation of a study programme for re@@ accredi@@ tation .
although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school pla@@ cements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the sel@@ f@@ evaluation report .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place before external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
in 13 countries and regions , there are no official regulations which lay down procedures and mechanisms for internal evaluation .
in the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) , internal evaluation is expected but is not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly required .
Greece : the information rela@@ tes to the law on quality assur@@ ance in higher education issued in August 2005 .
in ten countries or regions , higher education institutions have to undertake internal evaluation at fixed inter@@ vals of longer periods ranging from three to ten years .
Alternati@@ vely , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evalu@@ ations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . in Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
in Ireland , internal evaluation , which has to be carried out every ten years , results in external evaluation of the quality assur@@ ance procedures adopted by higher education institutions .
in the nine countries or regions in which the frequ@@ ency of internal evaluation is not determined by regulations , different scenarios are possible .
Iceland : higher education institutions are obliged to introduce an internal quality assur@@ ance system , which may take a variety of forms .
internal evaluation oc@@ curr@@ ing only once , to enable new programmes or institutions to be accredi@@ ted for the first time , is not covered .
inadequate quality may , for example , mean that institutions have to draw up and implement a plan for improvement consisting of various measures , which may be subject to follow@@ up evaluation .
penalties are also possible , as when an institution is no longer granted the right to award qualifications , or when its funding is ad@@ jus@@ ted .
over and above their consequences for institutions , the results of evaluation may also be made available to their staff , students and the general public .
the following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the avail@@ ability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
in just five countries or regions ( the French Community of Belgium , Denmark , Ireland , Austria and Finland ) , these aspects der@@ ive only margin@@ ally from regulations - if at all .
it is intended that they should - entirely on their own initiative - introduce a procedure for reform inspired by the findings of external evaluation ( which remain confi@@ dential ) .
however , in the end it is the government of the Community which decides on the possible consequences of external evaluation .
in the majority of countries , the findings of external evaluation provide the basis for a decision regarding the ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation of institutions or programmes .
in Lithuania , evalu@@ ations conducted by the centre for quality assessment in higher education are ge@@ ar@@ ed as a priority to enhancing quality , but their results also fe@@ ed into a ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation process .
if the results are not satisfactory , the institution concerned may continue to offer its existing programmes but may not introduce any new ones until it has improved its performance .
the level of funding may also v@@ ary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) .
the results of these evalu@@ ations are taken into account notably during negotiations to ren@@ ew the four @@@ -@@ @ year public funding contract .
this generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time , which var@@ ies from one country to the next .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation decisions , conditional or temporary accredi@@ tation may be awarded in the case of non @@@ -@@ @ compliance with accredi@@ tation requirements .
in the Czech Republic , if the accredi@@ tation awarded to study programmes is subject to certain conditions , the faculty has to submit ( generally within two years ) a report on the fulfil@@ ment of imposed conditions .
the publication of evaluation findings means that they are available de facto to all those involved in the functioning of higher education .
in Austria , the publication of external and internal evaluation results is not subject to any regulations , which may be due to a lack of regulations on evaluation in general .
in practice in this country , evaluation results are usually made available to the stak@@ ehol@@ ders .

Czech Republic : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the annual internal evaluation , and ( 2 ) to internal evaluation that occur@@ s prior to external evaluation .
Ireland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external review of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teaching practice .
according to regulations , the results of annual internal evaluation must be available to the public , but the institution concerned decides whether or not to publish them .
Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
Slovenia : according to internal institutional rules , internal evaluation results are published on the website of the faculty concerned .
they are also published in reports produced by the national higher education quality assessment commission .
in 11 countries , the results have to be available to academic staff and students .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursu@@ es several aims .
it is intended to help control the system , provide reports on its quality and enable adjustments to enhance its performance .
it imp@@ lies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .

professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nation@@ ally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in several countries , the design of in@@ service education programmes has become completely decentral@@ ised and is the responsibility of schools .
as a consequence , schools and local education authorities offer training based on the skills and development needs of teachers and schools .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illu@@ strated in the examples below .
in Greece and Cyprus , public authority in@@ service teacher education centres are the only bodies offering provision .
in Norway , higher education institutions are the sole providers of in@@ service teacher education .

Belgium ( B@@ E F@@ r ) : the information rela@@ tes solely to the In@@ stitu@@ t de la formation en cour@@ s de carri@@ è@@ re ( in @@@ -@@ @ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of in@@ service education at joint level of all public and private providers ( inter@@ r@@ é@@ se@@ au@@ x ) .
these two projects are currently being implemented .
Lithuania : draft regulations on the evaluation of in@@ service teacher education are in the final phase of legal approval .
their approval and a first evaluation are planned for 2006 . Iceland : evaluation of higher education institutions providing in@@ service teacher education has not yet been carried out .
in these two countries , regulations on both accredi@@ tation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
the contents of the course have to be relevant to the objectives and strategies of the institutions and the initial education of the participants .
although no regulations exist in Cyprus , evaluation of in@@ service education programmes is conducted by the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical Institute of the Ministry of Education and Culture .
in Malta , organisers are encouraged to review their courses by asking participants to fill in questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res .
furthermore , in England , the Tra@@ ining and Development Agency for Scho@@ ols has an extended re@@ mit covering in@@ service education for teachers .
in Spain , depending on the legislation of the Aut@@ onomous Community concerned , the evaluation of in@@ service teacher education providers consists of different elements .
those referred to as " comp@@ ul@@ sory " in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.2 are common to all Aut@@ onomous Commun@@ ities , whereas those termed " op@@ tional " reflect the situation of just some of them .
Belgium ( B@@ E F@@ r ) : the information rela@@ tes solely to the In@@ stitu@@ t de la formation en cour@@ s de carri@@ è@@ re ( in @@@ -@@ @ service education institute ) which is responsible for the organisation and evaluation of in@@ service education at joint level of all public and private providers ( inter@@ r@@ é@@ se@@ au@@ x ) .
Ireland : data refer to both the external evaluation of a samp@@ le of in@@ service teacher education courses and the peri@@ o@@ dic evaluation of in@@ service teacher education providers .
Italy : ( 1 ) ref@@ ers to higher education institutions and institutions for initial teacher education , and ( 2 ) to teacher unions or associations and private @@@ -@@ @ sector training providers .
Lithuania : the draft regulations include almost all procedures on a comp@@ ul@@ sory basis . Slovenia : data refer to accredi@@ tation only .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . an au@@ dit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspec@@ torate specifically established for school education or in@@ service teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
in line with the decentral@@ ised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accredi@@ tation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Aut@@ onomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of in@@ service teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
as regards evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many L@@ ä@@ n@@ der have established or appointed central institu@@ tes or agencies for this task .
an agency for evaluation or an evaluation committee
the ministry of education , a ministry department or commission
Finland : In@@ service teacher education of at least 30 EC@@ T@@ S provided by higher education institutions may be accredi@@ ted by the FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC at the request of the provider .
in Hungary , the process occur@@ s at three levels . at prepar@@ atory level , the organis@@ er of the programme asks an expert from the National Reg@@ ister of Ex@@ per@@ ts to give an opinion on it .
in a second stage , an expert from the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ ó@@ gu@@ s @@@ -@@ @ t@@ ov@@ á@@ b@@ b@@ k@@ é@@ p@@ z@@ é@@ si Ak@@ kredi@@ t@@ á@@ ci@@ ó@@ s Tes@@ tü@@ let ( In @@@ -@@ @ service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining Ac@@ credi@@ ting B@@ ody ) evalu@@ ates the programme in accordance with a guide@@ line based on legal regulations and then prepares a proposal to the minister on the decision of approval of the programme .
in Poland , depending on the course evalu@@ ated , two different bodies carry out evaluation .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practi@@ sing teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during after@@ no@@ ons , week@@ ends or summer .
the heads of regional education authorities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) , which are subordin@@ ate to the ministry , evaluate and acc@@ re@@ dit qualification courses offered by all other providers .
in the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium and Ireland , the inspec@@ torate is part of the ministry of education .
an inspec@@ torate for in@@ service teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining ) , where it particip@@ ates in evaluation along with other bodies .
in the French Community of Belgium , the In@@ stitu@@ t de la formation en cour@@ s de carri@@ ere , a community @@@ -@@ @ wide institution , organis@@ es and evalu@@ ates in@@ service teacher education , notably through its operators .
however , this does not necessarily mean that the issues mentioned in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.@@ 4 are not usually covered .

participants " opinions on the training they receive
In@@ service teacher education abroad
in the majority of them , the content of the activity as well as the teaching methods and / or the compet@@ ences of the tra@@ in@@ ers are taken into account .
the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accredi@@ tation of in@@ service teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
consist@@ ency between content and organisation of the activity and the educational aims seems to be one of the most important aspects .
in Ireland , evaluation also focuses on the re@@ lev@@ ance of the course to the primary school curricul@@ um and the extent to which the activity comp@@ lies with official policy and guidelines .
the detailed content requirements are compared with the goals of the respective training programme and with the data given by the programme organis@@ er .
moreover , evaluation analy@@ ses whether the programme emphasises successful learning and how the issues presented can be put into practice .
in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
programmes are then accredi@@ ted for five years . if providers want to continue their programmes after the fifth year , they must go through the accredi@@ tation procedure again .
programme providers are also required to carry out sel@@ f@@ evaluation procedures .
furthermore , the Sul@@ i@@ Nova K@@ ht ( a non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisation ) monitors in@@ service teacher education programmes by means of a sel@@ f@@ evaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervis@@ es and approves the National Centre of In@@ service Tra@@ ining activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educ@@ ational Auth@@ orities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of in@@ service teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the R@@ EA
in Slovenia , according to regulations which have been in place since the 2004 / 05 school year , only part of in@@ service courses are accredi@@ ted each year .
the results of the accredi@@ tation and evaluation of in@@ service education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( C@@ hap@@ ter 4 ) .
in the Czech Republic , accredi@@ tation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Commission .
the Ministry has the right to control the accredi@@ ted programmes during the period of accredi@@ tation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in Latvia , the commission has the right to withdraw approval given to a programme if there is proof that it has failed to meet requirements .
in Poland , negative evaluation findings can result in the accredi@@ tation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for in@@ service courses to be chann@@ elled into other training institutions .
this accredi@@ tation may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn if there is proof of irregularities .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @@@ -@@ @ making with respect to the goals , processes and instruc@@ tors of the programmes .
in the Netherlands , accredi@@ tation results are published on the website of the N@@ eder@@ lands @@@ -@@ @ Vla@@ am@@ se Ac@@ credi@@ tati@@ e Organ@@ is@@ ati@@ e ( N@@ V@@ AO , or Ac@@ credi@@ tation Organisation of The Netherlands and F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
these reports are then sent to the Council for Program@@ mes of Contin@@ u@@ ing Education and Tra@@ ining of Profes@@ sional Staff of Scho@@ ols and kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens .
on the basis of these reports , an overall national report is prepared and is discussed and assessed by the Council before being sent to the minister of education .
in Romania , accredi@@ ted teacher training programmes are published in a list used by teachers for the selection of the in@@ service training course that they must attend every five years .
these reforms have been referred to in previous chapters .
many countries have begun reforms of the organisation of initial teacher education and in@@ service training sometimes in relation to the Bologna process , or are inten@@ ding to do so .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adap@@ t procedures for evalu@@ ating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
the introduction of the two @@@ -@@ @ cycle ( bac@@ hel@@ or / master ) structure in several L@@ ä@@ n@@ der in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
later , it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that , in order to be granted this recognition , courses had to be struc@@ tured in mo@@ du@@ les , accredi@@ ted and therefore evalu@@ ated be@@ fore@@ hand .
the previous system of evaluation sought to ensure that the regulations were comp@@ lied with .
ongoing debate on the evaluation of initial and in@@ service education is exam@@ ining how far evaluation of this kind should become general practice and whether it achiev@@ es its aims .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and comp@@ ul@@ sory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the defin@@ ition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of in@@ service teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
in the case of quality assur@@ ance , recommendations should be submitted to the Wel@@ sh Assembly Government by January 2007 .
at or near the end of this period of study , they en@@ rol in a programme of initial professional training , enabling them to qualify as teachers .
Syn@@ ony@@ ms : assessment , au@@ dit , pe@@ er review , quality assessment , review .
they describe the character@@ isti@@ cs of the requirements and conditions to be met , and therefore provide the ( quanti@@ t@@ ative and / or qual@@ it@@ ative ) basis on which an evalu@@ ative conclusion is drawn .
external evaluation : the process where@@ by a specialised external body collec@@ ts data , information and evidence about an institution or a programme , in order to make a statement about its quality .
internal evaluation : a process carried out under the responsibility of those working within an institution , consisting of the systematic collection of administrative data and the questioning of students , lec@@ turers and other staff .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curricul@@ um of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be at@@ tained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredi@@ ted or certi@@ fied .

the potential tasks are ranked by priority on the basis of both the results of the risk analy@@ s@@ is@@ and the need to ensure a balanced coverage of budgetary areas .
adding value to financial management
Th@@ is@@ includes making suggestions on how to cost @@@ -@@ @ effectively : improve compliance with legislation ; reduce the risk of err@@ ors and irregularities ; improve the organisation of European Union activities and its internal control systems ; make the European Union 's actions more transparent by improving accounting methods and procedures ; and@@ achieve EU policy objectives more effectively and efficiently .
irregularities and fraud
the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors reports on any irregularities and suspec@@ ted@@ fraud .
the Treaty also requires that the Court of Au@@ di@@ tors be requested to give a formal opin@@ ion@@ on each proposal to@@ introduce or amend legislation with a financial impact , including the fight against fraud .
the objec@@ tiv@@ e@@ is to ensure that transactions have been executed in accordance with the rele@@ van@@ tru@@ les andre@@ gula@@ tions , that they exist in reality , have been correc@@ tly calculated and that the benefic@@ i@@ aries of EU aid hav@@ eful@@ filled their obligations .

the Court , in common with other public au@@ dit bodies , has two different approaches to sound financial manag@@ em@@ ent@@ audi@@ ts , depending on the topic under au@@ dit and the risks involved .
the first approach is to evaluate the management of the expendi@@ ture , and particularly the measures taken to achiev@@ ev@@ al@@ ue for money .
the au@@ dit concludes on whether the approach tak@@ en@@ by management was likely to ensure value for money , and if not , how it could be improved .
this involves an exam@@ ination of whether , and how , the objectives of the specific expendi@@ ture w@@ er@@ e@@ achiev@@ ed@@ and an assessment of whether the minimum resources were used for that outcome .

for every au@@ dit undertaken , the audi@@ tors prepare an au@@ dit planning memorandum which sets out the au@@ dit scope , approach and objectives , and how these are to be achieved in the most efficient and cost @@@ -@@ @ effective way .
it includes deta@@ il@@ s@@ of the human and other resources needed to complete the task and practical information such as countries to be visi@@ ted@@ and how au@@ dit evidence is to be collected , as well as the au@@ dit timetable .
the audi@@ tors collect evidence in accordance with@@ the au@@ dit programme , both within the European Union institutions and on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ spot in M@@ ember and benefic@@ i@@ ary States .
the type of evidence needed depends on the trans@@ ac@@ tion@@ or au@@ dit subject in question and , in particular , on the conditions for receiving the EU aid .
however , the extent of this testing can be reduced when reli@@ ance is placed on the internal control systems , where it is possible and economic to do so .
if the au@@ dit testing shows that the systems are well conce@@ ived and operating effectively , the amount of direct test@@ ing@@ of transactions necessary to meet the au@@ dit objectives can be reduced .
the purpose of the statement is to allow the audi@@ tees to confirm the fac@@ tual accur@@ acy of the Court 's au@@ dit fin@@ d@@ ing@@ s@@ and to give them the opportunity to provide any further information or explan@@ ations that may be necessary .

monitoring the drug situation
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . key indicators , core dat@@ as@@ ets ) which offer countries a " common language " with which to interpre@@ t the drug phenomenon .
as well as monitoring the drug situation today , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is ever vig@@ il@@ ant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies .
this publication of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) and the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission of the Organ@@ ization of American States ( C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS ) is protected by copy@@ right .
a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet .
starting from a highly het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous group of drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories across different contin@@ ents , the en@@ deavour is to extr@@ act the essence of their experience and to trans@@ mit the final result in such a way that it can be re@@ interpreted in other re@@ alities and conditions .
although this is the outcome of a long elabor@@ ation and ref@@ le@@ ction process , the hand@@ book itself should be considered more as a starting point , rather than as a final achievement .
these are only a few of the questions that this hand@@ book tries to address in a practical manner , starting with the most important one : why do we need a national drugs observatory ?
one of the first consequences of this form@@ alised approach was an acknowled@@ gement of the need to set up national monitoring systems and obser@@ vat@@ ories .
since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @@@ -@@ @ based policy @@@ -@@ @ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
this change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions , and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful .
wh@@ il@@ st the political responsibility remains in the hands of decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , there is a growing consensus that they need objective , fac@@ tual , reliable and compar@@ able information in order to take informed decisions .
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership ( 3 ) , and neighbourhood countries ( 4 ) that wish and / or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs , such as the Inter@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Dru@@ gs Ob@@ ser@@ vatory C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS , to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and / or to consolidate their national obser@@ vat@@ ories ;
• non @@@ -@@ @ EU countries involved in a co@@ operation on drugs matters with the EU and with other
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
we must inform the re@@ ader of the following in relation to this publication :
although it presents a concep@@ tual framework , it is based on practice in establishing the network 15 years ago , and in expanding it to more than 15 new countries since then .
• we do not offer a single model to be cop@@ ied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sor@@ ts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a struc@@ tured analysis of each national context .
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policy@@ making and for the organisation of drug @@@ -@@ @ related services , and on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues of general interest ;
a national drugs observatory ( N@@ D@@ O ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information concerning drugs and
) , and their consequences .
according to national priorities , the scope of the work of the N@@ D@@ O may focus only on illi@@ cit drugs , or could also cover alcohol , tobacco and other li@@ cit drugs ( such as pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs ) .
national audience : the N@@ D@@ O addresses the information needs of four groups of customers which make up its audience at national level : decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , the scientific community , professionals working in the drugs field , and the general public .
as far as the work of an N@@ D@@ O is concerned , we use the term " core functions " to describe the key processes to be developed and implemented by the N@@ D@@ O .
in order to present the core functions of an N@@ D@@ O , we have adap@@ ted the concept of " business process . "
depending on the resources and the mandate of the N@@ D@@ O , and on the data and expertise available in the country , a range of possible set @@@ -@@ @ ups are possible , as presented in C@@ hap@@ ter 7 - Chal@@ len@@ ging questions ) .
in order to gather , produce , analy@@ se and dis@@ semin@@ ate information in a regular manner , the N@@ D@@ O must build a sustainable network that is able to work continu@@ ously on its own improvement .
one of the main tasks of the N@@ D@@ O is to establish a national drug information network together with the partners and resources identified in the information map .
science , and our knowledge and understanding of the drugs phenomenon , are also in constant evol@@ ution .
in other words , developing the drug information network , and the related networking tasks , is part of an ongoing process that represents the N@@ D@@ O 's principal and most time @@@ -@@ @ consum@@ ing activity .
in most cases , the main publication produced by the N@@ D@@ O on a ye@@ arly basis will be a national report or an executive sum@@ m@@ ary of the latest developments in the national context .
it is of particular importance that the N@@ D@@ O provides an up@@ date of the national drugs situation ye@@ arly , both for national and for international purposes .
in addition to the national report , the N@@ D@@ O may also be expected to produce reports on ad ho@@ c studies and to provide evidence for the evaluation of national strategies and action plans .
a critical issue for the development and strengthening of the N@@ D@@ O lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other public@@ ations in co@@ operation with its national and local partners .
in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
1 sup@@ ran@@ ational organisations , called the Lisbon consensus (
O@@ AS ) , the National Institute on Dru@@ g Ab@@ use ( N@@ I@@ DA ) , the World Health Organ@@ ization , the International E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology Wor@@ k@@ group and the Global HIV Preven@@ tion Research Network .
• Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related crime ( violations of drug laws ; pro@@ portion of property crimes associated with drug consumption ; pro@@ portion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption ) ;
based on this list , each regional or international drug monitoring network has developed its own model taking into account its specific needs and its institutional environment , but the core data remain the same .
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transp@@ os@@ ition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
) is struc@@ tured so as to cover two main areas : " monitoring the situation " which covers ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology , crime and markets , and " monitoring responses " which covers interven@@ tions , law and policies .
they are also used for the analysis of the coverage of responses or the assessment of the impact of policies and actions .
the data sources employed to calc@@ ulate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the rout@@ ine information systems used in the country .
the treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next .
according to the situation outside Europe , it may be necessary to collect data on other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases that are related directly or indirectly to drug use or drugs users , such as tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis and sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted inf@@ ections .
drug seiz@@ ures can be as much an indicator of law enforcement activity in terms of supply reduction as they are of drug avail@@ ability , but if cross @@@ -@@ @ checked with qual@@ it@@ ative information they may be a confirmation of drug flows .
the gui@@ ding principle of this new clas@@ si@@ fication is the target population by ass@@ ump@@ tions concerning its risk for sub@@ stance abuse , but not the overall objective or content of a prevention intervention , as was the case previously .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has developed a monitoring tool which addresses the policies and interven@@ tions that M@@ ember States have established to protect drug users from further exclu@@ sion and to improve their social inclusion .
• the situation and assistance to drug users in prisons ; • law @@@ -@@ @ enforcement measures as an alternative to prison for drug offen@@ ders , and ;
• law @@@ -@@ @ enforcement measures especially targeting stat@@ ut@@ ory di@@ ver@@ sions addressed at young offen@@ ders , in order to avoid their pro@@ gres@@ sion into the criminal justice system .
in addition , the following research protocols to study the consequences of drug use have been developed or are currently under development : emergency rooms ; treatment centres ; and mortality associated with drug use .
E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ological research forms the foundation the O@@ ID 's work in Latin America and the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an , and is the sine qu@@ a non of any drug information system .
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book solid ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology based network in each country , leading toward the development of trend data on drug use throughout the region .
the O@@ ID programme estimates the human social and economic costs of drugs in the

to further this effort , the O@@ ID is embar@@ king on a collabor@@ ative en@@ deav@@ or with the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction to develop a meth@@ od@@ ological tool to
although local data collection may already exist , the process of establishing a national drugs observatory is usually linked to the need to provide sub @@@ -@@ @ regional or international organisations with data on the national drugs situation .
however , a problem frequently en@@ countered is that this information is not collected in a co@@ ordinated and systematic manner , which may be compo@@ unded when some of the actors involved do not work together .
data in relation to the complex drug phenomenon are of little value if not put into context and analy@@ sed .
to identify national experts and professionals who could contribute either to a better understanding or to a better reporting of the national situation is very important .
once the relevant contact people have been identified , this sum@@ m@@ ary document should be sent to them , in order to prepare the first meeting .
it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " in C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
indeed , at the start of the information map process , the objective is to initiate contact with persons identified before sending any explan@@ atory document .
people can facilitate or slow down the process , either because they find it interesting or because they feel threatened when sharing their data and possibly their responsibility .
by " system , " we mean a struc@@ tured organisation of het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous sources of information that is needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the drug situation .
the elements of this system are not bound necessarily by hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical relations and its financing does not come from a single source of funding .
• the process of construc@@ ting the system must be documented and monitored : this is the role of the national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS - see P . 46 ) .
this may also apply when experts from different institutions are going to take part in the work of the N@@ D@@ O , for instance for drafting the national report .
the next step of the process involves the preparation of a national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS ) , in which information is combined so as to identify objectives and actions to be undertaken .
the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS should give the guidelines for the work to be carried out over the years to come .
therefore , what matters here is to identify and estimate for the concrete actions that will be launched as additional resources become available .
• D@@ ata collection : it is the responsibility of the N@@ D@@ O to identify g@@ aps and needs for additional data collection exercises , and to conv@@ ey this information to the national authorities .
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's five key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators ;
with the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS , the N@@ D@@ O and its partners identi@@ fies what needs to be done long @@@ -@@ @ term in order to implement the drug monitoring reference framework , using the information map as a starting point .
however it is important to bear in mind that kno@@ wing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are mer@@ ely long @@@ -@@ @ term goals .
once the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS is endorsed by its main stak@@ ehol@@ ders , then the N@@ D@@ O can prepare a ye@@ arly work programme .
the relationship between the partners is non @@@ -@@ @ hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical , but the network exists around a project which is co@@ ordinated under the leadership of the N@@ D@@ O .
it is the role of the N@@ D@@ O to keep the project on track , ste@@ ering the collabor@@ ative process towards a common goal .
contributions by partners , especially in deliver@@ ables produced by the N@@ D@@ O , should be acknowledged ; compet@@ ences available in the network should be used and recognised .
for networks being established following the initiative or request of the N@@ D@@ O and / or the national authorities , the Co@@ ordination role of the N@@ D@@ O should be two @@@ -@@ @ way .
• the Inter @@@ -@@ @ Minist@@ erial Dru@@ g Committee ( funding of N@@ D@@ O staff who co@@ ordinate the production of the national report and who ensure national reporting obligations are met )
• other national organisations for some ad ho@@ c surveys and / or qual@@ it@@ ative studies among drug users • laborat@@ ories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences • the national drugs observatory in its role of co@@ ordinator of the whole network .
when possible , on the basis of the experts and institutions identified during the information map exercise , establish a national working group for each set of indicators and core data and for national reporting .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
• Pres@@ ent the missions of the N@@ D@@ O and the national drug information network : the ultimate goal is to meet national reporting obligations
• T@@ ry to arran@@ ge a meeting every 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 years with your partners to share information , discuss the conclusions of your reports , and reflect about current trends .
the N@@ D@@ O has a key role in raising awareness on this issue with partners and driving a consensus on concrete steps to take in order to improve the quality of data collected .
improving the quality of information on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues following an initial identification of potential problems or shortcomings may be achieved by establishing new sources of information , or capacity building .
• Car@@ ry out a formal review of data quality and avail@@ ability at national level with an expert panel • compar@@ e results with international guidelines and standards

• working with quanti@@ t@@ ative data ; • analy@@ sing qual@@ it@@ ative information ; • interpre@@ ting and putting together all sources of information .
it is also important that staff keep a record of all of the information related to the data used for any reporting .
while the data collected through surveys or through government records allow for some kind of meas@@ urement , there are some areas or some aspects of the drugs situation that can@@ not be directly meas@@ ured .
2 inform about " (
Met@@ ad@@ ata give us in@@ sight as to how data were collected , what they describe and refer to , and about the reli@@ ability and compar@@ ability of the information provided .
is this study part of other sets of studies that are being compared , or is it a one @@@ -@@ @ off study ?
Met@@ ad@@ ata are as important as the data themselves , and should be stored and kept up@@ dated by the national drugs observatory , under what is sometimes called the " statistical met@@ ad@@ ata system . "
when the N@@ D@@ O identi@@ fies problems on compati@@ bility of defin@@ itions and their application with international standards and protocols , it should explore with the data providers the reasons for these discre@@ pan@@ cies and try to find solutions .
where sam@@ pling has been employed , the method of sam@@ pling can determine whether the samp@@ le is representative of the target population , or some sub@@ set ( 3 ) .
central to which prob@@ abil@@ istic sam@@ pling method is employed is the avail@@ ability or not of a co@@ her@@ ent samp@@ le frame , or l@@ isting of the target population .
Pro@@ b@@ abil@@ istic methods , correc@@ tly implemented , allow gener@@ alis@@ ations to be made to the population listed in the samp@@ le frame , with statements of sam@@ pling er@@ ror in the form of confidence inter@@ vals .
if in principle the study findings are to be gener@@ alis@@ able , it is necessary to ensure that the samp@@ le is representative .
different discipl@@ ines may make reference to different types of val@@ idity , however with quanti@@ t@@ ative studies , what is important to ensure is that :
• the measure is relevant to the study population ; • the measure is relevant to the experts in the subject ;
while assessing the val@@ idity of the studies or surveys , special attention must be paid to possible bi@@ ases , or non @@@ -@@ @ ran@@ dom or systematic err@@ ors , entering into the data .
this criter@@ ion rela@@ tes to technical issues that may arise and that may have an impact on the study and bias the results .
was there any decision taken by the inter@@ viewers that may influence or affect the sam@@ pling method ?
the N@@ D@@ O is expected to use its statistical knowledge to assess the conclusions of the reports and surveys that it has received , and / or to conduct or contribute to the statistical analysis of primary data .
scientific objec@@ tivity and independence are essential conditions for the legitimacy and credibility of the work of the N@@ D@@ O and its partners - any compromise would undermine the vi@@ ability of the whole system .
qual@@ it@@ ative research gives us an opportunity to make sense of quanti@@ t@@ ative information , by further expl@@ oring :
• interpre@@ ting statistical data and placing it in context ; • providing in@@ sight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug @@@ -@@ @ using pat@@ ter@@ ns ; • assessing the context in which interven@@ tions may be more effective ; and • helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interven@@ tions ; • understanding new drug using phenom@@ ena ; • providing in@@ sight into drugs markets .
the N@@ D@@ O plays an important role in making an invent@@ ory of such research results in its country , and in integr@@ ating these results in its analysis and reports .
it can also identify the areas where additional qual@@ it@@ ative research is needed , and launch a joint project with its partners if resources are available .
qual@@ it@@ ative research is characterised by a wide range of approaches and data collection techniques , and determining how to judge the quality of a qual@@ it@@ ative study will depend on the approach adopted .
efforts have been made to develop criteria within qual@@ it@@ ative research which are accepted broad@@ ly as re@@ pla@@ cements for what quanti@@ t@@ ative researchers call val@@ idity and reli@@ ability .
the strength of qual@@ it@@ ative research is that it addresses the relationship between the researcher and the research object , prec@@ lu@@ ding the no@@ tion of a common truth .
generally , qual@@ it@@ ative studies are not interested in an " average " - they gain an understanding of the experience of particular groups or individuals .
in any case , we need to understand how the samp@@ le was selected in order to understand the results and in order to draw conclusions .
describing methods is not an easy task in qual@@ it@@ ative research but you should be able to assess whether the methods were a sen@@ sible and adequate way of addressing the research question .
• W@@ as attention given to the reli@@ ability of inter @@@ -@@ @ observers and to the val@@ idity of findings ?
• - with other parts of the study ; • - with the results of other studies performed in the same environment ?

• Do@@ es the author ( s ) reveal his / her view point ( s ) and discuss how his / her view point ( s ) may affect the study ?
• Wh@@ o auth@@ ored and who reviewed the study ?

such studies can be used as additional sources of information , keeping in mind that the results can@@ not simply be transferred to other populations .
reli@@ ability and val@@ idity challenges for drug trend monitoring systems or potential for er@@ ror , lie in two broad areas : at the level of individual sources and at the whole system level .
a number of researchers have argued in favour of the use of mixed methods for drug trend
to ensure sustainability and " buy @@@ -@@ @ in , " it is vital that the N@@ D@@ O ensu@@ res that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stak@@ ehol@@ ders and audiences - both at national and sup@@ ran@@ ational level .
in the long run , a failure to build visi@@ bility and to demonstrate the added value of the N@@ D@@ O will automatically have a negative impact on its credibility .
this is one aspect of the N@@ D@@ O 's reporting that may sometimes be under@@ estimated , for instance when the focus of its work , or of its mandate , is to meet national reporting obligations of sup@@ ran@@ ational or international organisations .
the reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stak@@ ehol@@ ders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its form@@ at , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
it is difficult , for example , to assess ex an@@ te the information needs of customers of public services .
instead , it should be possible to use particip@@ ative techniques such as focus groups with sub@@ groups of end @@@ -@@ @ users to assess in detail the re@@ lev@@ ance of specific out@@ puts .
• A@@ n assessment of the information needs of its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national level , through regular dialogue with its direct " clients , " for instance by asking their fe@@ ed@@ back about their products
the N@@ D@@ O 's potential stak@@ ehol@@ ders and potential clients are decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , professionals working in the drugs field , the scienti@@ fi c community and the general public .
once the stak@@ ehol@@ ders have been identified , it is necessary for the N@@ D@@ O to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
their decision has an impact on the existence of the national drugs observatory and on the investment in the national drugs information network .
they are the N@@ D@@ O 's key partners and data providers ; they need to be motivated for maintaining or even increasing their contribution , and they should gain some benefit for their efforts .
their potential needs cover a broad range of information : external sources of funding for training and training materials , grants , et@@ c . ; national drugs situation in an international context ; international standards and meth@@ od@@ ological tools in their respective field of activity .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
two additional groups could also be added to the list of stak@@ ehol@@ ders , although they are usually not the primary target for the N@@ D@@ O 's communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination strategy .
an N@@ D@@ O contribution to their work could either be in the form of providing information or contributing to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of their research results .
making clear and under@@ stan@@ dable information available to the general public is part of their fundamental rights : it is also an obligation for organisations that are being established with public money .
the same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the form@@ at and content needs identified in the mat@@ ri@@ x .
information covering a wide range of technical and meth@@ od@@ ological issues , struc@@ tured and well documented contents , in a not @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ detailed form@@ at ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a comp@@ il@@ ation of documents ) .
producing a report that goes beyond a simple descri@@ ption of the situation can be done either by being pro@@ active or by using the information available in a more cre@@ ative manner :
how can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them ? "
in the first approach , additional information identified by the N@@ D@@ O may be needed , which may mean deciding how to obtain or produce the missing information .
a comple@@ mentary approach can be to cor@@ rela@@ te the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level .
when the N@@ D@@ O produces reports and other out@@ puts , it should always be able to answer the ... " so what ? " question .
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @@@ -@@ @ defin@@ ed@@ . ned .
• Be prospec@@ tive : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and per@@ spec@@ tives , or new risks
there are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
this is what we will describe brief@@ ly , starting with the UN reporting system , which is used worldwide .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Ann@@ ual Re@@ ports questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res ( AR@@ Q ) and it had been regularly reported to the CN@@ D ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
the Commission on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs ( CN@@ D ) : is the central policy@@ making body of the United N@@ ations in drug @@@ -@@ @ related matters .
each of the protocols are stand@@ ardis@@ ed with the goal of producing information that is compar@@ able across countries .
the information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comp@@ rise the ME@@ M In@@ str@@ ument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
• they are used to build a European picture , to analy@@ se the situation and the evol@@ ution of the phenomenon and responses ;
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quanti@@ ty and quality of the information provided by their respective M@@ ember States - this information needs to be accur@@ ate , provided on time , and reliable ;
• clar@@ ify the process for delivery and identify the end benef@@ i ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national co@@ ordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs co@@ ordinating body , et@@ c . )
• Be fac@@ tual and neutral , do not exceed your role : the N@@ D@@ O 's credibility reli@@ es on its objec@@ tivity , not the political opinions of its staff
indeed , the long @@@ -@@ @ term challenge for the N@@ D@@ O is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that its various " clients " are satis@@ fi@@ ed@@ . ed .
the next step is to consider whether the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
a more appropriate question would be " how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observatory 's communication strategy , within the limits of its re@@ mit ? "
this does not prevent the head of the N@@ D@@ O answ@@ ering requests for information from journalists , but the internal procedure could imply li@@ a@@ ising with the press relations officer of the host institution .
in countries where the N@@ D@@ O is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug co@@ ordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 7 ) :
when the N@@ D@@ O is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confi@@ dential note to the national drug co@@ ordinating body ( N@@ DC ) - if relevant - or trans@@ mits the information through the normal channels .
the main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming " hot " topics .
get to know key journalists , build a long @@@ -@@ @ term relationship with them , be simple , try to understand their constra@@ ints and the way they think , so as to form@@ at the information for them .
1 ) : environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
we refer in particular to a study published by Al@@ ford in 2001 , in which he presents a few character@@ isti@@ cs that can apply to N@@ D@@ Os ( we ital@@ ic@@ ise ) :
• the organis@@ ational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @@@ -@@ @ production ) " ( 3 ) .
• N@@ D@@ O production depends on its co@@ operation with other national sources of information and of expertise , in most of the cases it can@@ not work on its own ( co @@@ -@@ @ production )
• the N@@ D@@ O buil@@ ds its capacity on the basis of di@@ verse resources and partners , at national , local and sup@@ ran@@ ational level ( combined resources )
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clar@@ ify the mandate for its establishment ;
• the value of the N@@ D@@ O 's work is not always meas@@ ur@@ able - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and out@@ puts ;
• the value of the N@@ D@@ O 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
to conclude : try to identify and define the N@@ D@@ O 's perceived or potential added value from the point of view of its audience / stak@@ ehol@@ ders , rather than from one of its promo@@ ters ( see box below ) .
note : an " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " ( or ele@@ vat@@ or speech ) is an over@@ view of an idea for a product , service , or project .
the name reflects the fact that an ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch can be delivered in the time sp@@ an of an ele@@ vat@@ or ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 50 @@@ -@@ @ 100 words ) .
to support the perceived value of the N@@ D@@ O , we propose using three categories of criteria to identify additional actions / measures : added value of N@@ D@@ O 's products , credibility , and relations with its audiences and stak@@ ehol@@ ders .
is the N@@ D@@ O promoting itself as the reference organisation that can ta@@ il@@ or information according to the needs of its customers ?
is the N@@ D@@ O trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
in fact , in many cases , most of the N@@ D@@ O 's products are the result of partnerships and co@@ operation , and external expertise may be needed also to val@@ idate its analy@@ ses and reports .
• ensure that its partners der@@ ive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system : it is important partners are motivated to provide the data , as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected ;
information map : is an information map drafted and permanently up@@ dated so as to identify any source of expertise and information available in the country , and is there any communication policy ge@@ ar@@ ed towards the strategic partners ?
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confron@@ tation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
content : do contents of reports and other public@@ ations reflect the need for a M@@ ulti@@ disciplinary and multi@@ fac@@ eted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
does the N@@ D@@ O have a specific and exp@@ li@@ cit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy ?
does the country co@@ operate with - and have access to - funding from international or sup@@ ran@@ ational organisations such as the EU , UNODC , WHO , O@@ AS , CAR@@ IC@@ OM or the Global Fund ?
scientific and professional expertise : are there any drug @@@ -@@ @ related research activities in the country that could provide some information on the drugs situation , or that could benefit from the support and co@@ operation with the N@@ D@@ O ?
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evalu@@ ations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
a strategic plan aims to make sure that the N@@ D@@ O will consolidate or improve its situation and will maxim@@ ise its position as regards the three key strategic factors , which could be sum@@ mar@@ ised as follows :
• to improve and to diversi@@ fy the co @@@ -@@ @ production scheme so as to produce better products which are ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of its different client groups ;
• to better comb@@ ine the resources from national and local level , both in terms of data and of expertise , so as to consolidate the co @@@ -@@ @ production processes and the quality of public@@ ations and other out@@ puts .
what matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
in the current context of general soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic difficulties , one should avoid the temp@@ tation of presenting exagger@@ ated objectives and excessive requests for funding .
these will not only be refused by the decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , but will also give the N@@ D@@ O and its promo@@ ters a negative image that might prove fatal for the organisation 's survival .
however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the cho@@ ices to be made .
however , these tools are based on a pre @@@ -@@ @ requ@@ isite : do think about what you can already do with what you and your partners have , D@@ on '@@ T say " I can@@ not do anything until I get more . "
in this chapter we will present and provide some elements of response to common questions frequently asked about national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories , and to which there is usually no single answer .
• within national drug Co@@ ordination bodies or under government departments ; • within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health ; • within the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security ; • within a university or a non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisation .
it is important to ensure that co@@ operation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the supply side .
it is important to ensure that co@@ operation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side .
if the N@@ D@@ O is established at a too low structural and hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical level within an existing institution , this presents the same dis@@ advantages and also gives no visi@@ bility to the N@@ D@@ O and its products .
it then becomes extremely difficult for the N@@ D@@ O to fulfil its mandate and address the needs of its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national level .
the latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
• limiting the scope of the N@@ D@@ O 's work to illi@@ cit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of sup@@ ran@@ ational and international organisations such the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and UNODC ;
it can also provide the opportunity to observe and analy@@ se possible cor@@ relations between
• The technical and scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how of the N@@ D@@ O and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• The N@@ D@@ O needs to attract and to keep competent staff , and it needs to be stable so as to ensure both its scientific capacity and the quality of its processes and deliveries ;
if the N@@ D@@ O is established as a small unit , it often ten@@ ds to rely too heavily on external expertise and sometimes poorly @@@ -@@ @ organised national networks .
if the N@@ D@@ O is given an important national mandate as an observatory , this imp@@ lies that the compet@@ ences required need to cover the full range of core functions as described in chapters 3 to 5 .
if this is the case , special attention must be paid to institutional relations and co@@ operation , and to communication and public relations .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the N@@ D@@ O will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ D@@ O 's capacity to deliver out@@ puts and be accountable for the use of funds .
the objective of this review is to ensure that there are neither mistakes nor any mis@@ interpre@@ tation of the data , and to val@@ idate the publication .
the N@@ D@@ O is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics .
if the N@@ D@@ O is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies , at the request of their respective national authorities .
• the N@@ D@@ O should reserve the right to accept - or to propose a technical modi@@ fication in order to accept - to perform the evaluation ;
• the N@@ D@@ O 's contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds ( fac@@ tual , neutral , objective , reliable ) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the re@@ mit of national authorities ;
• the N@@ D@@ O should clar@@ ify what are the questions of the evaluation for which there is no evidence available .
when the scope of the work carried out by the N@@ D@@ O within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the N@@ D@@ O .
however there have been situations in which despite these precau@@ tions , some political actors have accused the N@@ D@@ O of a lack of objec@@ tivity and of being " politically oriented " - if not , providing " false " data .
the time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice .
as you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
taking on board the ideas , concep@@ ts and experiences that have been shared with you in this hand@@ book , you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observatory should be like .
there are no institutional models to be cop@@ ied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to form@@ alise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concep@@ ts and principles that remain valid ir@@ respective of country or region .
the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission ( C@@ IC@@ AD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organ@@ ization of American States ( O@@ AS ) in 1986 as the western hem@@ is@@ phere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
as well as gathering information on the demand and reduction of the demand for drugs , the agency in recent years has extended its monitoring and reporting on drug supply , supply reduction and illi@@ cit drug markets .
data collection in the C@@ IC@@ AD system takes place within the context of the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Ob@@ ser@@ vatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID ) .
one of the agency 's key aims is to ren@@ der drug information more compar@@ ab@@ le@@ across Europe .
although the Centre can@@ not propose any kin@@ d@@ of policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @@@ -@@ @ making throug@@ hits analy@@ ses , instruments and standards .
the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D report sub@@ stance use among students in 35 countries
a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet .
it can be acc@@ essed through the Europ@@ a ser@@ ver ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u ) .
the work of the ES@@ PA@@ D project would not have been possible without the gener@@ ous support of the Swedish Government , the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou Group .
sum@@ m@@ ary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bun@@ des@@ l@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
country samp@@ le siz@@ es were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
a small number of questions regarding cigarette smoking are given at the beginning of the questionnaire .
in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
on average , 7 % of the students said that they had been smoking cigarettes on a daily basis at the age of 13 or younger .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
only four countries give a contrary image regarding the long@@ term down@@ ward trend in recent smoking , dis@@ playing higher levels in 2007 than in 1995 .
hence , the overall picture of the trend in past 30 days smoking in the ES@@ PA@@ D countries is one of a decrease , or at least of a stabil@@ ized situation .
the total amount of alcohol consu@@ med during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequ@@ encies .
in nearly all countries boys drink larger quantities than girls . the most pronounced contrast to this is Iceland , where girls report larger quantities than boys .
in a large majority of the countries , beer is the dominant be@@ verage among boys while spir@@ its is the most important be@@ verage among girls in a little more than half of the countries .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man and the United Kingdom .
however , there are countries in which many students report heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days , while they were rather low on the ranking list for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness for the same period .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more even@@ ly distributed pat@@ tern , with spir@@ its as the most important type , con@@ stitut@@ ing about one third of the total consumption .
on average 43 % of the ES@@ PA@@ D students reported heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days , and this was more common among boys ( 47 % ) than among girls ( 39 % ) .
boys also dominated in a large majority of the countries .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
on average , half of the ES@@ PA@@ D students have been in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ated at least once during their lif@@ etime , to the point of stag@@ gering when walk@@ ing , having s@@ l@@ urred speech or thro@@ wing up .
there were gender differences in the frequ@@ encies of dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ES@@ PA@@ D level there were no gender differences .
the most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the pro@@ portion of students reporting heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i@@ .@@ e@@ . by 31 percentage points .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
countries in which many students report dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness this often include Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
students reported problems related to their alcohol consumption include Bulgaria , the Is@@ le of Man , the United Kingdom and Latvia .
however , for some of the problems the aver@@ ages are about the same and for one ( " serious problems with friends " ) it is even slightly higher among girls .
in the two top @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Is@@ le of Man ) one in six students reported can@@ na@@ bis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular can@@ na@@ bis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
one @@@ -@@ @ third of the students in the ES@@ PA@@ D countries find can@@ na@@ bis read@@ ily available .
countries where many students report past 30 days can@@ na@@ bis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try can@@ na@@ bis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illi@@ cit drugs at least once during their lif@@ etime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from can@@ na@@ bis were found , and the percentage of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users in a population correspon@@ ds to the can@@ na@@ bis use pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the single countries .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report non@@ pres@@ cri@@ bed use of these drugs ( 8 % ver@@ sus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
slightly more girls than boys did so ( 8 ver@@ sus 5 % ) .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illi@@ cit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ES@@ PA@@ D countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of can@@ na@@ bis between 2003 and 2007 .
students from Cyprus , the Is@@ le of Man , Malta and Slovenia report the highest lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ hal@@ ants in 2007 ( 16 % ) , while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Ukraine .
the average for lif@@ etime use of in@@ hal@@ ants for all ES@@ PA@@ D countries is 9 % and there are no gender differences on the ag@@ gre@@ gate level .
the rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lif@@ etime use relatively well across countries .
it is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substan@@ ces .
the overall sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the vari@@ able in focus .
the up@@ ward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lif@@ etime use of illi@@ cit drugs - predominantly can@@ na@@ bis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
no changes in gender differences are apparent for illi@@ cit drugs or the other substan@@ ces mentioned .
individual country pre@@ val@@ ence rates for the key@@ vari@@ ables are compared to the aver@@ ages for all countries .
the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the vari@@ ables .
sum@@ m@@ ary western Europe and countries dis@@ playing increases are often found in eastern Europe .
a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illi@@ cit drug use is rising .
we hope that still more European countries will join in the next survey , in addition to the over 40 countries that are part of the ES@@ PA@@ D project already .

sum@@ m@@ ary - the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D report
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult cho@@ ices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
the global debate on the drug problem is not short on rhetoric regarding the need for a balanced and evidence @@@ -@@ @ based approach .
drug use is a complex issue , and it is not one that len@@ ds itself to simple conclusions .
a ref@@ le@@ ction on the information available also remin@@ ds us of the need for continued vig@@ il@@ ance and of the dangers of compla@@ cen@@ cy .
non@@ e@@ theless , in Europe as a whole , a tre@@ mend@@ ous effort has been made to address these sor@@ ts of problems ,

• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal Wor@@ king Party on Dru@@ gs - and the European Commission ;

• the Trans@@ lation Centre for Bo@@ dies of the European Union and the Office for Official Pub@@ lic@@ ations of the European Commun@@ ities ;
graph@@ ics and tables in this report may reflect a sub@@ set of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
the 2006 statistical bul@@ letin ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / stat@@ s@@ 0@@ 6.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
the national reports of the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x fo@@ cal points give a detailed descri@@ ption and analysis of the drug problem in each country and are available on the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / ? n@@ no@@ de@@ id = 4@@ 35 ) .
a continuous programme of evaluation is envis@@ aged for the strategy , with annual progress re@@ views and impact assessments at the end of each of the two action plan periods .
nearly 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
the strategy can be seen as representing a European consensus on how the drug problem should be addressed .
non@@ e@@ theless , the new drug strategy suggests that the European policy debate on drugs is increasingly characterised by agreement on a common framework for activities .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ag@@ eing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
among those new to treatment , the numbers with a primary op@@ i@@ oid problem have been decreas@@ ing in most countries .
non@@ e@@ theless , this is an area where waves of ep@@ i@@ demic use have been seen in the past , and therefore compla@@ cen@@ cy must be avoided .
overall range 0.@@ 8 % to 1@@ 1.3 %
elsewhere , while some moderate increases in levels of cocaine use have been noted in a few countries , dramatic increases are not being reported .
typical range 0.@@ 3 % to 1.5 % ( 15 countries )
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
in Europe , cocaine use is at histor@@ ically high levels , and studies suggest that it is a common pat@@ tern for increases in problems relating to a drug to la@@ g some years behind increases in pre@@ val@@ ence .
almost 7 000 ac@@ ute drug deaths , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2003 data )
although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being ca@@ us@@ ally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all high@@ pre@@ val@@ ence countries .

a common theme running through this report is the increasing need to develop responses that are sensitive to the complex and multi@@ fac@@ eted nature of today 's drug problem .
among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 , can@@ na@@ bis was the primary reason for refer@@ r@@ al to treatment in about 15 % of all cases , making it the next most com@@ mon@@ ly reported drug after heroin .
while g@@ lob@@ ally meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine problems continue to grow , within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long @@@ -@@ @ established problems .
in 2006 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA published a technical paper on hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms , and this issue is again sum@@ mar@@ ised in our annual reporting .
the avail@@ ability and use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms appears to have been increasing since the late 1990s but to a large extent has passed un@@ noticed .
the emer@@ gence of m@@ C@@ P@@ P illu@@ stra@@ tes the fact that those involved in the production of illi@@ cit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chem@@ ic@@ als that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to poten@@ ti@@ ate or modi@@ fy the effects of M@@ D@@ MA ( ec@@ st@@ asy ) .
such innovation requires a response as the potential for these substan@@ ces to cause severe health problems is unknown .
there are simil@@ ar@@ ities with the 2004 evaluation of the 1999 Portuguese national drug strategy and the 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 04 action plan , conducted ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally by the Portuguese National Institute for Public Administration and intern@@ ally by the Institute for Dru@@ gs and Ad@@ diction ( I@@ D@@ T ) .
and in Romania , the national drug strategy 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 was evalu@@ ated with the participation of all state institutions involved in the field of drugs with the findings forming the basis for the new national drug strategy 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 12 .
on the other hand , it also found that there has been a fall in the age at which people first experim@@ ent with drugs and an increase in dru@@ g@@ related deaths linked to substan@@ ces other than op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
in addition , the Ministry of Health and Con@@ sum@@ ers " Affairs has approved an action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 to mobil@@ ise resources and implement initiatives with the aim of pro@@ g@@ ressing and rev@@ it@@ alising the national drug strategy .

first , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 in June 2005 .
it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , will present annual progress re@@ views .
finally , the process will be particip@@ ative , involving an evaluation ste@@ ering group whose task will be to define the meth@@ od@@ ology , output and provisional cal@@ end@@ ar .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the ste@@ ering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , as well as representatives of the M@@ ember States .
Con@@ sul@@ t@@ ative hearings for civil society representatives will also be organised .
it has been replaced by a new regulation adopted on 11 February 2004 ( 4 ) .

chapter 1 : policies and laws
possession of more than 10 dos@@ es must be charged under Sec@@ tion 17@@ 2 , which , depending on the ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
in addition , the age of criminal li@@ ability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
the maximum sentence for theft of a large amount of drugs or theft by an organised group has been extended to 15 years .
exem@@ ption from penalty and postpon@@ ing the exec@@ ution of the penalty can now be applied to drug law offences .
several countries legisla@@ ted on threshold quantities of drugs during the reporting period .
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offen@@ ders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guide@@ line on can@@ na@@ bis , " according to which possession of up to 10 gram@@ s of can@@ na@@ bis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
the Minister of Health of Lithuania amended recommendations on what shall be regarded as small , large and very large amounts of narco@@ tic and psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces , re@@ defining these quantities .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .
see " The role of the quanti@@ ty in the prosecution of drug offences , " an EL@@ D@@ D legal report , and T@@ able 1 in " illi@@ cit drug use in the EU : legislative approaches , " an
other sent@@ encing statistics showed that the w@@ ai@@ ving of reports as stat@@ ut@@ ory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convic@@ tions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by ste@@ aling ( Ki@@ vi@@ v@@ u@@ ori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed comp@@ ul@@ sory treatment , effectively decreas@@ ing the involvement of the prob@@ ation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .
statistics on sent@@ encing , or avo@@ idance of sent@@ encing , give a far more accur@@ ate picture of the implementation of a country 's drug policy than does the text of the laws ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 2@@ a ) .
data on " reports " ( 11 ) of drug law offences are available in all the European countries analy@@ sed in this report .
they reflect differences in national legislation , but also the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced , and differences in the priorities and resources allocated by criminal justice agencies to specific offences .
) , it is more appropriate to compar@@ e trends rather than absolute numbers .
rout@@ ine data are available in the EU only on the last type of crime - drug law offences .
in most EU M@@ ember States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
over the same five @@@ -@@ @ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .

chapter 1 : policies and laws at presenting a first in@@ sight into this emerging phenomenon in the European Union .
a slow integration , strate@@ g@@ ically or institu@@ tionally , of li@@ cit drugs into policy and measures against illi@@ cit drugs appears to be more and more common .
this is found in the drug policies of some M@@ ember States and in EU drug strategies .
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to under@@ pin , support and explain to the population at large the ration@@ ale under@@ lying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical gu@@ idance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in France and Ireland ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe four countries ( Belgium , Germany , Italy and Luxembourg ) reporting on new projects in this area .
with the recognition and development of the selec@@ tive prevention approach by most M@@ ember States , vulnerable groups are increasingly being targeted .
approaches not based on abst@@ in@@ ence are effective in reducing not only consumption but also initi@@ ation among those groups in which in@@ cip@@ i@@ ent drug use is already oc@@ curr@@ ing .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological situation that has been achieved by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ driven development and implementation of indicator @@@ -@@ @ based monitoring , stand@@ ardis@@ ed reporting on responses is limited .
the new M@@ ember States and candidate countries account for only a small frac@@ tion of the clients in sub@@ stitution treatment in the European region , which can partly be explained by lower levels of op@@ i@@ oid use in these countries .
although the overall provision of sub@@ stitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indic@@ ations of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .

the reduction of dru@@ g@@ related deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
in the Czech Republic , Italy , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , local or regional policies are reported to exist , and in Bulgaria strategies have been drawn up at local level in nine cities .
according to the reports by N@@ F@@ P@@ s ( 35 ) , objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of sy@@ ner@@ gy at the European level . besides drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , target groups include sex workers and prisoners .
in the new central European M@@ ember States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies wi@@ den the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .
however , in 10 countries ( 37 % ) , inf@@ ec@@ tious disease strategies exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly mention the prevention of hep@@ ati@@ tis C infection among drug

the common strategic platform on the reduction of health@@ related harm that the EU drug strategy provides is mir@@ ro@@ red in many national policies across the EU and has supported a main@@ stream@@ ing of evidence @@@ -@@ @ based responses in this area .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
units that speci@@ alise in tre@@ ating can@@ na@@ bis or cocaine users have been reported from 13 countries , and specific treatment programmes for these groups in drugs agencies exist in eight countries .
a similar specialised programme for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 action plan calls on M@@ ember States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social re@@ integration programmes . "
although social measures are still a less well @@@ -@@ @ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interven@@ tions combin@@ ing treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug us@@ er rehabilitation .
non@@ e@@ theless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
the main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
under the current economic circumstances , many countries may find it difficult to meet the voc@@ ational re@@ integration needs of older heroin users , even if they are stabil@@ ised in drug maintenance treatment .
the service most com@@ mon@@ ly offered to home@@ less problem drug users is access to " gener@@ ic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries comb@@ ine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from M@@ ember States conver@@ ge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and prec@@ ar@@ ious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social re@@ integration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
) Social re@@ integration is defined as " any social intervention with the aim of integr@@ ating former or current problem drug users into the community . " the three
" pil@@ lars " of social re@@ integration are housing , education and employment ( including voc@@ ational training ) .
as facilities are currently available in most countries , and as some countries continue to implement new structures , the effect of these measures will depend on ensuring that home@@ less problem drug users can access these services .
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Sen@@ eg@@ al , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports , 2005 ; W@@ C@@ O , 2005 ; IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 6@@ a ) .
quantities seized may f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seiz@@ ures are very large .
data on quantities seized in 2004 provided by the Netherlands were only estimates , which could not be included in the analysis of trends to 2004 .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe shows a continuous increase over the period 1999 @@@ -@@ @ 2004 , although in 2004 a majority of countries ( but not Spain )
Kingdom for 2004 are not yet available .

( 53 ) The average pro@@ portion was compu@@ ted as the average of national pre@@ val@@ ence rates weigh@@ ted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
figures here are probably a minimum , as there could be some under @@@ -@@ @ reporting .
participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illi@@ cit drugs , with the standard time fra@@ mes , and frequ@@ ency of use .
by contrast , in the 2004 US national survey on drug use and health ( 60 ) , 4@@ 0.2 % of adults ( defined as aged 12 years and older ) reported lif@@ etime use , compared with the EU average of about 20 % .
figure 2 : last year pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use among young adults ( aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 and 15 @@@ -@@ @ 24 )

countries where the rate is higher than 25 % include Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia ( 27 @@@ -@@ @ 28 % ) and Belgium , France , Ireland and the United Kingdom , where lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ran@@ ges from 32 % to 40 % .
the lowest lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence estimates ( less than 10 % ) occur in Greece , Cyprus , Sweden , Romania , Turkey and Norway ( 61 ) .
this could represent an important long @@@ -@@ @ term change in can@@ na@@ bis use pat@@ ter@@ ns that mer@@ its further attention .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
other countries are also working on scal@@ es to assess intensive forms of can@@ na@@ bis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is promoting collaboration in this area .
it has been hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ ised that use may be spreading to smaller towns or rural areas , and Poland documented this trend in its 2005 national report .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the early 1990s on@@ wards , and some of these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sights into trends over time .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
this bench@@ mark has often been used in studies and can be der@@ ived from the European model questionnaire .
in addition , school surveys can give valuable information about trends in drug use among the younger members of the population , which may predict future trends among young adults .
in most countries , since 1995 , there has been an overall increase in the number of school students who have ever tried can@@ na@@ bis .
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78
although the number of these requiring interven@@ tions is unknown , the number of can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related treatment demands is small in relation to this figure .
a number of factors are likely to be associated with the increased demand for can@@ na@@ bis treatment , and this remains an area requiring research scrutiny .
the available data suggest that can@@ na@@ bis clients in out@@ patient treatment centres tend to be relatively young : virtually all can@@ na@@ bis clients new to treatment are under 30 years old .
almost no one seeking treatment reports having used can@@ na@@ bis for the first time after the age of
well @@@ -@@ @ implemented universal prevention programmes can delay or reduce the initi@@ ation of young people into the use of substan@@ ces such as tobacco , alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis .
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @@@ -@@ @ on@@ set users ( pre@@ - to mid @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ o@@ le@@ sc@@ ence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( V@@ on Sy@@ dow et al . , 2002 ; Ch@@ en et al . , 2005 ) .
an additional consideration in stri@@ ving to prevent or delay the on@@ set of initi@@ ation into can@@ na@@ bis use is the fact that ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents are more vulnerable to can@@ na@@ bis to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity .
some clients seek treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use in combination with other drug or alcohol problems , and sometimes the request for treatment is related to more general problems , such as conduct dis@@ order among young people . furthermore ,
the pro@@ files of young can@@ na@@ bis users , at least in the early stages of consumption , do not differ from those of young alcohol or tobacco users .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe prevention for young people should not focus on can@@ na@@ bis alone , but should be aimed at preventing use of alcohol and tobacco too .
it is known that one reason for intensive consumption of alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis among boys is that they find it difficult to approach girls , and thus these projects offer training in f@@ li@@ r@@ ting .
brief interven@@ tions are cost @@@ -@@ @ effective and may be particularly appropriate to can@@ na@@ bis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
brief intervention is an approach that aims to make people reflect on their use of drugs and to provide them with skills to control it .
there is evidence for the effectiveness of brief intervention in preventing alcohol and tobacco misuse , and there is growing interest in the value of this approach for other substan@@ ces .
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interven@@ tions may take the form of coun@@ selling , " can@@ na@@ bis courses " or even self @@@ -@@ @ help websites .
for example , the German website @@@ -@@ @ based coun@@ selling programme , Qu@@ it the S@@ hit ( www.@@ dru@@ g@@ com@@ .@@ de ) , is an innovative approach , using te@@ lem@@ atics , for can@@ na@@ bis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .

demands for treatment related to ec@@ st@@ asy use are reported to account for less than 1 % of all treatment demands in most countries , with the exception of Cyprus , Hungary , Ireland and Turkey , where ec@@ st@@ asy clients constitute between 4 % and 6 % of all clients seeking treatment .
reports about ac@@ ute or chron@@ ic health problems requiring medical interven@@ tions relating to the use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms are rare . however , some countries changed their laws in response to the use of such hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces by young people .
six countries have tigh@@ tened up their legislation on mus@@ h@@ rooms in the last five years ( Denmark , Germany , Estonia , Ireland , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) .
for example , in the United Kingdom , during the early 200@@ 0s , the number of shops selling hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms increased , and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stal@@ ls across the country .
this is a common feature of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to conf@@ ine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for rec@@ re@@ ational purposes ( 130 ) .

the reason for this would appear to be the mechanism of action through which cocaine ex@@ er@@ ts its effects on the brain ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in .

the potential benefit of the cocaine vacc@@ ine T@@ a @@@ -@@ @ CD has raised ethical concerns about the use of a vacc@@ ine : who would receive it , who would make the decision and on what criteria , et@@ c .
the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely un@@ explo@@ red , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
as cocaine use can escal@@ ate quickly , brief interven@@ tions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth expl@@ oring .
in a number of cities cr@@ ack cocaine users have been targeted by out@@ reach sch@@ e@@ mes that attempt to engage with what is often viewed as a difficult group to work with .
for example , one study of an innovative out@@ reach treatment programme in Rot@@ ter@@ dam ( Hen@@ s@@ ken@@ s , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for tre@@ ating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .

the number of repeat requests has generally not declined , and in most countries the total number of treatment demands for heroin has remained roughly stable .

since the mid@@ 1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of ep@@ i@@ demic spread of HIV among in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .

this defin@@ ition of P@@ D@@ U is a pu@@ rely behavi@@ our@@ al one based on drug consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns and does not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly measure problems in any sense .
non@@ e@@ theless , it is linked to the various concep@@ ts of addi@@ ction by the understanding that someone be@@ having in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem us@@ er . "
this changing position must be seen against the background of greatly expanded treatment provision for those with op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ related problems as well as increased reporting coverage of treatment services .
non@@ e@@ theless , in many countries it appears that those developing a drug problem today in Europe are likely to be , in terms of the substan@@ ces they are using at least , more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous than has histor@@ ically been the case .
histor@@ ically speaking , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA monitoring indicator was a child of its time - during the 1980s , and to a large extent the 1990s , heroin use and in@@ j@@ ecting drug use were seen as key components of the drug problem that required esti@@ mation .
while the P@@ D@@ U indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem , it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today 's more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous
in terms of the current implementation of the P@@ D@@ U indicator across the EU , countries have adap@@ ted the defin@@ ition to cover the prac@@ tic@@ alities of their local situation and the position is therefore het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorpor@@ ated into the monitoring exercise , beyond P@@ D@@ U monitoring .

the way forward in this area requires the form@@ alising of the concept of frequent , intensive use of can@@ na@@ bis and other illi@@ cit drugs as a specific target for monitoring .
this pat@@ tern of use seems to exist among some chron@@ ic users , possibly among margin@@ alised groups , possibly among people with psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric conditions .
under these circumstances , any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include pol@@ y@@ drug use as one of these separately meas@@ ured components .
a second drug with a functional or pharmac@@ ological ration@@ ale is not con@@ fined to simultane@@ ous use but may also be used consecu@@ tively , as a replacement or as a comple@@ mentary drug .
increased risks through pol@@ y@@ drug use
survey results do show considerable use of more than two drugs by individuals in the same time period .
an example of the extent of pol@@ y@@ drug use data available from population surveys can be seen in a recent technical report of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ( 200@@ 5@@ b ) .
figure 15 : use of drugs in the last year by different us@@ er groups in the general population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34
Pol@@ y@@ drug use could be us@@ efully defined oper@@ ation@@ ally as the frequent use of more than one sub@@ stance over a minimum specified time period , for example one month .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
given that many of the data sources available are based on behavi@@ our@@ al reports of drug consumption , the concept of frequent or intensive use needs to be developed on this basis .
the European Union and its M@@ ember States give considerable support to international programmes and , in a global context , it is satis@@ fying to observe that , in a number of important areas , the European situation looks relatively positive .
they recognise that the way forward lies in analy@@ sing the available evidence regarding both the size and nature of the problem and the costs and benefits of different intervention approaches .
this is our role , and as Chairman of the Management Board and Director we accept no compromise on this position and take pride in the high standards we maintain .
but while scientific ri@@ g@@ our is essential to our work , we must never forget that behind the figures we report are real human be@@ ings whose lives have been affected and sometimes ru@@ ined by drug problems .
to develop effective responses to the drugs problem requires us to be dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate about our data , but we must never become dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate about the topic .

Europe plays an increasingly important role in supporting global actions to reduce drug problems
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
moreover , it should be bor@@ ne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently collabor@@ ating with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to establish a database for the collection of prison health indicators .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
not only do many of those entering prison have drug problems , but studies show that drug use often continues in prison .
these sor@@ ts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the compos@@ ite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can en@@ comp@@ ass the target concept .
the new regulation of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA emphasises the importance of identi@@ fying and dis@@ semin@@ ating good practice .
a key difficulty here is the real world sett@@ ings in which demand reduction interven@@ tions are applied .
the complex@@ ities of assessing evidence for effectiveness and identi@@ fying quality control standards are addressed in this report .
can@@ na@@ bis : popularity may have pe@@ aked - as recognition of public health issues gro@@ ws
there are still considerable differences between European countries in the nature and scale of their national drug problems and also in the range and config@@ ur@@ ation of response .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging M@@ ember States to develop and expand harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction activities .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most com@@ mon@@ ly consu@@ med illi@@ cit drug by young and very young people .
drug use among those who are developing both physi@@ cally and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompan@@ ying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
although some M@@ ember States have introduced sch@@ e@@ mes to di@@ ver@@ t offen@@ ders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
and , although the data are still relatively weak , there is some evidence that the popularity of the drug among the younger age groups is decreas@@ ing in some countries .
over 7 500 ac@@ ute drug deaths , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2004 data )
Europe remains the main global market for can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , most of which is produced in North Africa . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis is also available in Europe ,
Co@@ ordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new inter@@ governmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine inter@@ diction .
each year , around 400 cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related deaths are reported in Europe , and there is a suspicion that cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular deaths in which cocaine has been an ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating factor may go largely un@@ detec@@ ted .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher pro@@ portion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tri@@ pled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
during the 1990s , the experience , or potential threat , of a widespread HIV ep@@ i@@ demic among drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors was a cataly@@ st for the development of services for this group .
increased pre@@ val@@ ence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
as a result , especially in areas where pre@@ val@@ ence has been high , the burden of infection resulting from in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is likely to be decreas@@ ing .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
( H@@ C@@ V ) - including a significant pro@@ portion who are no longer using drugs .
across Europe , H@@ C@@ V rates are high among in@@ j@@ ecting populations , and studies show that young in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @@@ -@@ @ using care@@ ers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
this raises the question for Europe : what effect will this increase have on the drug problem ?
in the north and north @@@ -@@ @ east of the country , not only have increasing wage rates and falling op@@ ium prices deter@@ red pop@@ p@@ y plan@@ ting , but also some high @@@ -@@ @ value vegetables actually generate greater returns than pop@@ p@@ ies .
in these areas , cro@@ p diversi@@ fication has been supported by counter @@@ -@@ @ narcotics efforts and greater governmental involvement - leading to a general perception that op@@ ium prohibi@@ tion measures will be enforced .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems ar@@ ising from lack of security .
reductions in cultiv@@ ation can be achieved quickly but are rever@@ sed equally quickly .
over@@ d@@ ose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoi@@ dable mortality among young adults .
of drug treatment data and drug over@@ dos@@ es suggests that the heroin @@@ -@@ @ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
particularly of concern is the fact that in a few countries the pro@@ portion of younger people among those dying has been growing .
reducing drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths is an important public health target and the reasons for the f@@ alter@@ ing in the down@@ ward trend needs to be identified .
in Austria , a growing pro@@ portion of treatment demand clients are under 25 and are seeking help for problems due to the use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids di@@ ver@@ ted from legitimate uses .
this approach , which has been in place in other M@@ ember States ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benef@@ ited from the experience of earlier ones .
esti@@ m@@ ating the cost of drugs to society is discussed in a section on drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture .
the objective of preventing and reducing the individual and collective harm resulting from the use of drugs is also shared by all countries .
the " balanced " approach , which aims to give priority both to supply reduction and to demand reduction , is also very widespread .
a noti@@ ce@@ able trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two comple@@ mentary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the policy of combin@@ ing a drug strategy with action plans facilit@@ ates more detailed defin@@ itions of objectives , actions , responsibilities and deadlines . some countries , for example
the new regulation clar@@ i@@ fies the countries to which the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA can transfer its know @@@ -@@ @ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
moves towards the integration of li@@ cit and illi@@ cit drugs policies have been evident in some countries for several years ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Germany ,
in two M@@ ember States ( Belgium , Slovenia ) , the scope of the evaluation has been limited to a number of selected projects .
in most other countries , and at EU level , the implementation of the actions set out in the national drug strategy is system@@ atically monitored .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interven@@ tions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interven@@ tions and the importance given
having in the EU a diversity of national drug strategies with common objectives can be viewed as a strength because it allows compar@@ ative analysis of different types of approach .
almost all European countries mention the objective of evalu@@ ating their national drug strategy .
there is also some activity in the area of developing inde@@ x@@ es designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
drug policy inde@@ x@@ es countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Finland , Portugal ) , Co@@ ordination at regional or local level is directly supervised by the national Co@@ ordination bodies .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
the concep@@ tu@@ alisation of both instruments has involved interesting meth@@ od@@ ological developments and has allowed a first in@@ sight into the use of overall inde@@ x@@ es to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
a first ob@@ servation is that such instruments can be useful for a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al follow @@@ -@@ @ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alised with the analysis of individual indicators within the inde@@ x@@ es .
nevertheless , some general features can be described .
at the regional or local level , drug Co@@ ordination agencies and / or drug co@@ ordin@@ ators exist in most countries .
six countries provided detailed information of expendi@@ ture associated with tackling drugs ( T@@ able 1 ) .
this figure is likely to under@@ estimate the full extent of drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture , given the high level of under @@@ -@@ @ reporting . the six countries included in T@@ able 1 account for 76 % of the total public expendi@@ ture reported by EU M@@ ember States
the analysis of a State 's public expendi@@ ture provides useful information regarding the ability of its government to spend effectively and effici@@ ent@@ ly@@ . ci@@ ently .
indirect costs are the value of productive services not performed because of drug use , and typically cons@@ ist of lost productivity due to drug @@@ -@@ @ related mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related social costs are the total of all the costs to society , direct and indirect , caused by drug use .
second , it identi@@ fies the different components of cost and th@@ es@@ ize of the contribution of each sector in society .
such in@@ form@@ ation@@ can help to determine funding pri@@ or@@ iti@@ es@@ by highligh@@ ting areas where ine@@ ffici@@ encies may exist and savings can be made .
and Norway . based on the data supplied by these six countries , the total drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture by European countries is calculated to lie somewhere between
in addition , as of 2005 , the EC and the M@@ ember States had co @@@ -@@ @ financed drug @@@ -@@ @ related assistance projects in third countries to the value of over EU@@ R 750 million .
at EU level , considerable funding will be provided by the European Commission to tackle the drugs issue under the new 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 budget .
in response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently working towards developing a meth@@ od@@ ology that will enable the M@@ ember States , candidate countries and Norway to comp@@ ile stand@@ ardis@@ ed data on drug @@@ -@@ @ related expendi@@ ture .

at the end of 2006 , the European Commission presented its first progress review ( 5 ) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) .
this assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan 's objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled .

the drug programme is still being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council , in view of its adoption under the co @@@ -@@ @ decision procedure .
in June 2006 , the European Commission issued a Green Pap@@ er on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union ( 6 ) , as laid down in the drugs action plan .
the aim of the Green Pap@@ er is to explore how best to organise a continuous dialogue with civil society organisations active in the drugs field .
in Ireland , substan@@ tive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Ac@@ t 2006 , which sets out new offences of sup@@ plying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with anti@@ social behaviour and proposals to strengthen im@@ position of the 10 @@@ -@@ @ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EU@@ R 13 000 or more .
procedures regarding the drug testing of drivers are further described in the 2007 selected issue on drugs and driving .
this is stated to be in the interest of good order , safety , health and security , and would be carried out on samples of ur@@ ine , oral f@@ lu@@ ids and / or ha@@ ir .
in Romania , a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use , as well as measures to improve judicial co@@ operation , surveillance and cross @@@ -@@ @ border pursu@@ it and transfer of legal procedures .
there are also provisions for the temporary protection of witnesses in drugs cases and , in some circumstances , for protecting the identity of witnesses , as well as special rules for the questioning of such witnesses and use of under@@ cover officers .
in Norway , it is no longer the case that drug testing in the work@@ place can be carried out provided an employee or job applican@@ t gives consent .

EU funding for drug @@@ -@@ @ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
Greece , Cyprus , Lithuania and Italy monitor school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention , while in Greece , Poland , Sweden and Finland , community @@@ -@@ @ based prevention services are under study , and France has set up a central@@ ised system to monitor drug prevention .
some countries ( the Czech Republic , the autonomous region of Galic@@ ia in Spain , Hungary and Norway ) are already focusing on the evidence base when funding for interven@@ tions is applied for , and are considering introducing accredi@@ tation systems .
those that are evalu@@ ated are usually assessed in terms of the " scope and the acceptance of the intervention " rather than " the extent to which the objectives have been achieved " ( Greek national report ) .
treatment and harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction measures are also available to drug users and drug ad@@ dicts , and in a considerable number of countries their effectiveness has been evalu@@ ated through outcome studies .
in the sections below , the effectiveness of different types of prevention strategy is discussed , based on the results of this study and others .
the effects of individual prevention strategies can@@ not , in general , be meas@@ ured by changes in population @@@ -@@ @ level pre@@ val@@ ences of drug use .
however , every prevention strategy can be compared against the acc@@ um@@ ulated body of evidence , to determine whether or not it is an evidence @@@ -@@ @ based intervention .
member States are increasingly monitoring prevention interven@@ tions and , as a result , are deliver@@ ing data on the
criteria com@@ mon@@ ly used to determine whether an intervention can be considered an evidence @@@ -@@ @ based practice are e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness ( Brown et al . , 2000 ; F@@ lay et al . , 2005 ) .
it remains a challenge to determine how to evaluate and we@@ igh the different sources of evidence in the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process .
this will be even more difficult in the case of interven@@ tions for which a comprehensive evidence base has not yet been established but the experience of which would suggest may be effective .
frequently , interven@@ tions that have shown promise in controlled trials are implemented in the community to investigate how well they work under rout@@ ine conditions .
mass media campaigns ) to the provision of social @@@ -@@ @ emo@@ tional information ( trying to change perceptions about , for example , can@@ na@@ bis use ) .

national drug prevention campaign in Ireland seek to disp@@ el some of the my@@ ths that sur@@ round can@@ na@@ bis , such as claims that it is " organ@@ ic " and " natural . "

such sch@@ e@@ mes princip@@ ally take the form of information events and , to a les@@ ser extent , the provision of alternative le@@ is@@ ure @@@ -@@ @ time pursu@@ its .
member States are increasingly dev@@ oting attention to prevention strategies targeted at entire vulnerable
once target communities have been identified ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . France recognises " sensitive urban zones " or , in the case of schools , " educational priority zones " ) , supp@@ le@@ mentary funds can be directed towards these under@@ privileged groups .
in Ireland , Cyprus and the United Kingdom , selec@@ tive prevention projects are already delivered to most of these areas , and Portugal is in the process of implementing such a strategy .
in many M@@ ember States ( Bulgaria , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Austria , Romania ) the content of prevention

access to out@@ patient treatment is easier and less selec@@ tive in most countries , it is appropriate to extra@@ po@@ late from this group of clients to drug users as a whole .
although selec@@ tive prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ er programmes ( Ch@@ o et al . , 2005 ; Dis@@ hion and D@@ od@@ ge , 2005 ) , because negative " Con@@ tag@@ ion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
these un@@ intended effects , which are caused by the intervention itself , can lead to increased sub@@ stance use or risk behaviour .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the out@@ patient clients are treated for primary op@@ i@@ oid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular can@@ na@@ bis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
about 80 % of out@@ patient treatment clients are male , with a mean age of around 30 years ( 28 years among those new to treatment ) , and their living conditions are generally poor compared with the general population of the same age .
residential services are , however , of growing importance in the care of elderly and long @@@ -@@ @ term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the co@@ existence of serious som@@ atic and psychological co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty .
the philosophy of in@@ patient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
legal fra@@ me@@ works of sub@@ stitution treatment pharmac@@ ological treatment options have been expanded to meet the needs of specific us@@ er groups with the aim of increasing treatment coverage .
the substan@@ ces that can be used for sub@@ stitution treatment are norm@@ ally designated by law .
in some countries , sanctions for violating treatment rules are set out in national laws while in others the issue is at the discre@@ tion of each individual treatment centre .
after political endorsement as a response to heroin use in the second half of the 1980s , sub@@ stitution treatment has gone on to become the pre@@ dominant option for the treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence in most countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .

an important feature of the studies is that they investigate treatment out@@ comes in existing services under day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day clin@@ ical circumstances .
in Italy , the V@@ ede@@ t@@ te study ( 1998 @@@ -@@ @ 2001 ) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment offered in public treatment centres across the country .
there were some positive findings , such as increased rates of abst@@ in@@ ence from illi@@ cit drug use , a reduction in the frequ@@ ency of drug use , a reduction in crime and improved health .
to avoid " loc@@ king " clients into longer @@@ -@@ @ term service dependence , innovative approaches in the area of supported housing or financial management are being explo@@ red .
an up@@ date of the N@@ T@@ O@@ RS study will be provided by the Dru@@ g Tre@@ at@@ ment out@@ comes Research Study ( D@@ T@@ O@@ RS ) being carried out at the University of Man@@ ches@@ ter .
it aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment path@@ ways produce the best out@@ comes for particular sub@@ groups of drug users .
however , it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self @@@ -@@ @ es@@ te@@ em , status and a regular rhyth@@ m of life .
new ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises , ment@@ oring sch@@ e@@ mes and providing incentives such as S@@ ub@@ si@@ dis@@ ing tra@@ ine@@ es " wages or giving business start @@@ -@@ @ up loans .
in several countries , drug treatment facilities have started their own soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic enterprises , gain@@ fully emplo@@ ying their clients .
other initiatives focus on improving the employment situation through better mat@@ ching of pro@@ files , expectations and skills with the re@@ alities of work life .
the re@@ integration of margin@@ alised , ag@@ eing heroin users with high levels of som@@ atic and mental ill@@ ness poses a particular challenge .
in some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , struc@@ tured re@@ integration programmes are provided only as a follow @@@ -@@ @ on from successfully completed abst@@ in@@ ence @@@ -@@ @ based drug dependence treatment , and specific re@@ integration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
interpre@@ ting seiz@@ ures and other market data
can@@ na@@ bis is the world 's most com@@ mon@@ ly used illi@@ cit drug and a sub@@ stance that has been at the centre of the drugs debate in Europe since the 19@@ 6@@ 0s when its use became virtually syn@@ ony@@ mous with a growing youth counter@@ culture .
one important element in this picture is the different can@@ na@@ bis products now available on the European market . histor@@ ically , three main forms of can@@ na@@ bis have been common in Europe : can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in ; her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ; and , far less frequently , can@@ na@@ bis oil .
for many , the smoking of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in with tobacco remains the usual route of administration for the drug , though , elsewhere in the world , this pat@@ tern of use is relatively un@@ common .
in recent years , this picture has grown more complicated still with the increasing avail@@ ability of can@@ na@@ bis produced within Europe ; some of which is grown under controlled conditions and can be of relatively high poten@@ cy .
this kind of can@@ na@@ bis has become a specific product in its own right in many countries and complic@@ ates the assessment of the public health impact of changing pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis consumption .
the re@@ ader should note that there are difficulties in comp@@ iling information of this sort and , in many parts of the world , information systems are poorly developed .
because can@@ na@@ bis can be grown in a range of different environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , it is extremely difficult to produce convincing estimates of global production .
this is reflected in the fact that not all measures have gone in the direction of easing penalties and , in some countries , penalties have been made more severe or the current situation is under critical review .
this can be seen in the findings of the recent Euro@@ baro@@ meter survey ( 2006 ) , which asked European citizens if they agreed with the statement that personal consumption of can@@ na@@ bis should be leg@@ alised throughout Europe .
young people increased in virtually all countries . however , some of the more recent data suggest that the up@@ ward trend is lev@@ elling off , al@@ be@@ it at histor@@ ically high levels .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available , which in most cases will be between 2003 and 2006 .
three measures of drug use over time are com@@ mon@@ ly used for reporting survey data . lif@@ etime use or pre@@ val@@ ence is the bro@@ ade@@ st .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe are using can@@ na@@ bis in this fashion and that this fact may in part be reflected in the increases in can@@ na@@ bis treatment demands that have been observed in some countries .
despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ( 32
if attention is restricted to young people in the 15@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year age range , pre@@ val@@ ence estimates for lif@@ etime use range between 3 % and 44 % ( with most countries reporting figures in the range 20 @@@ -@@ @ 40 % ) .
moving the point of reference from lif@@ etime to last year , the levels of reported can@@ na@@ bis use fall but still remain considerable .
estimates suggest that more than 23 million European adults have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year , producing an average figure of about 7 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
it is estimated that 13.@@ 4 million Europeans adults used the drug in the previous month , on average about 4 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
total numbers were compu@@ ted by multi@@ plying pre@@ val@@ ence among the population concerned in each country and , in countries for which no information was available , imp@@ ut@@ ing the average pre@@ val@@ ence .
figures here are probably a minimum , as there could be some under @@@ -@@ @ reporting . )
there are additional esti@@ m@@ ations for Scot@@ land , Northern Ireland and a combined esti@@ mation for the United Kingdom is available ( presented in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin ) . )
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently working closely with a number of M@@ ember States on the development of a better meth@@ od@@ ological approach to this issue .
it is planned that this esti@@ mation can be up@@ dated in the near future .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
in this chapter , figures refer to " daily or almost daily use " ( defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days ) .
developing psy@@ cho@@ metric scal@@ es to identify intensive , dependent and problematic can@@ na@@ bis use in survey data there are important tempor@@ al differences between countries and waves of popularity ob@@ serv@@ able in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national report ) where a relatively high level of experim@@ entation was reported in the 197@@ 0s among cons@@ cripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 197@@ 0s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
and , the approach of restric@@ ting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any prec@@ ision .
in fact , nearly all EU countries now collect information on how many days the drug has been used in the month prior to interview .
however , this still provides only a b@@ lun@@ t tool for identi@@ fying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of can@@ na@@ bis .
during the early 1990s , the United Kingdom stood out as a high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence country , reporting on most measures the highest pre@@ val@@ ence figures in Europe .
however , last year pre@@ val@@ ence levels among young adults ( 16 @@@ -@@ @ 34 ) stabil@@ ised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.@@ 0 % to 16.@@ 3 % ) .
levels of can@@ na@@ bis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom pre@@ val@@ ence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
in the Czech Republic , a country with high pre@@ val@@ ence rates , trends are difficult to assess within the data available - although the information for young adults suggests that pre@@ val@@ ence levels may have fallen slightly .
tr@@ acking trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence in many countries of reliable time series data .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s on@@ wards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sight into trends over time .

however , there are interesting vari@@ ations between countries , with can@@ na@@ bis being cited by less than 5 % of all clients reported as entering treatment in Bulgaria , Lithuania , Poland and Romania and by more than 30 % in Hungary and France . for the remaining countries , in 12 the pro@@ portion of

overall , can@@ na@@ bis clients can be divided into three groups : those who use it occasi@@ onally ( 34 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 27 % ) and those using it daily ( 39 % ) .
the increase in the demand for can@@ na@@ bis treatment does not appear to have a simple explanation .
there are differences between countries in the frequ@@ ency of can@@ na@@ bis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily can@@ na@@ bis users and the other half with less than 30 % .

in some of the programmes , the ori@@ entation is as much towards prevention and harm reduction as towards the treatment of drug problems .
for can@@ na@@ bis users referred from court services , treatment interven@@ tions are not the only kind of response noted .

detec@@ ting trends in both price and p@@ urity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 1@@ 18 ) .

the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among all primary heroin users entering drug treatment ( 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 05 ) shows marked differences in levels of in@@ j@@ ecting between countries .
of the other countries able to provide data , the highest estimates have been reported from the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland and the United Kingdom , at between four and five cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 , and the lowest figures from Cyprus , Hungary and the Netherlands , at under one case per 1 000 .
it should be noted that trends in in@@ j@@ ecting in non @@@ -@@ @ heroin users may be different .
generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .
many countries have taken these concerns seriously , and Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom all report that re@@ views are under way with the objective of improving the quality of care provided .
one reason for interest in the use of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is that it is arguably a more su@@ itable pharmaceutical option than meth@@ ad@@ one for use in community practice .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is mar@@ ke@@ ted in the form of sub@@ lin@@ gual tab@@ lets , and although it is not considered a particularly attractive sub@@ stance to in@@ ject , reports exist that tab@@ lets have been dis@@ solved and in@@ j@@ ected .
the potential for misuse of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is supported by reports from some countries of the di@@ version of the drug onto the illi@@ cit market .
to de@@ ter illi@@ cit use of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , a new formu@@ lation of the drug , in combination with n@@ alo@@ x@@ one , has been developed .
the e@@ ffic@@ acy of heroin as a sub@@ stitution ag@@ ent has also been explo@@ red in experim@@ ental research in both Spain ( March et al . , 2006 ) and Germany ( Nab@@ er and Ha@@ as@@ en , 2006 ) .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( T@@ DI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requ@@ esting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 1@@ 23 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
and in Hungary , where the use of home @@@ -@@ @ made op@@ ium pop@@ p@@ y products has a long history , around 4 % of treatment requests are related to op@@ ium .
in the few countries reporting data on treatment demand in low @@@ -@@ @ threshold agencies , a significant pro@@ portion of drug clients seek treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use ( 1@@ 27 ) .
in the EU M@@ ember States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug sub@@ stitution treat@@ ments was at least 5@@ 85 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service avail@@ ability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem op@@ i@@ oid use were available for 2005 , the extent of sub@@ stitution treatment among problem op@@ i@@ oid users was calculated ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 ) .
however , the data does suggest the need to review the avail@@ ability of treatment options in all countries in order to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet estimated needs .
based on the most recent data available , op@@ i@@ oid users make up 40 @@@ -@@ @ 70 % of all treatment demands in 12 countries , less than 40 % in seven countries and more than 70 % in six countries ( 130
the percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreas@@ ing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . the only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
United Kingdom ( 1@@ 31 ) .
the levels of clients " repeat treatment demands and the numbers of clients in drug maintenance programmes is determined by historical developments in op@@ i@@ oid use inci@@ dence and pre@@ val@@ ence , as well as treatment service organisation and type .
the absolute decrease of new op@@ i@@ o@@ ids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the pro@@ portion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .
figure 10 : number of op@@ i@@ oid maintenance treatment clients as a percentage of the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users , 2005 generally high , education levels low , and between 10 % and 18 % are reported to be home@@ less .

the symbol indicates a point estimate ; a bar indicates an uncertainty inter@@ val ar@@ ising from the esti@@ mation procedures ; the number of op@@ i@@ oid users is estimated by various methods : T@@ m = treatment multi@@ p@@ lier ; PM = police multi@@ p@@ lier ; M@@ I = mul@@ tiv@@ ar@@ i@@ ate indicator .
furthermore , perceived safety of B@@ Z@@ P is fos@@ tered by the fact that the products are often sold by designated retailers or in specialised shops rather than on the street .

if young people do go online seeking drug information , a real question ar@@ ises as to the extent to which the information they access will be un@@ biased and accur@@ ate .
the main health risk associated with the use of G@@ H@@ B appears to be the high risk of loss of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness , especially when the drug is combined with alcohol or other sed@@ ative drugs .

a c@@ av@@ eat to this analysis is that in several high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries , recent case reporting data is not available ( Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria ) .

in interpre@@ ting this data , a number of consider@@ ations should be bor@@ ne in mind : infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s may not be diagnos@@ ed if they are not in contact with health services ; new inf@@ ections may not necessarily be attributed to drug in@@ j@@ ection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analy@@ sing levels of HIV infection in samples of new I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( those in@@ j@@ ecting less than two years ) and young I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( those under age 25 ) .
estimates for Spain and Sweden include 2006 data ; data for Ireland and Latvia are from 2003 ; data for Slovakia are from 2003 / 04 .
in mind that the size of these subs@@ amp@@ les is , in general , small and that HIV ser@@ op@@ re@@ val@@ ence data on young and new I@@ D@@ U@@ s is not available from some countries .
most available time series for the EU show stable pre@@ val@@ ence , suggesting that the numbers of infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s dying are balanced by the numbers of I@@ D@@ U@@ s contr@@ acting HIV infection .
among young I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( under age 25 ) in these samples , a high pre@@ val@@ ence ( over 40 % in at least one samp@@ le ) was found in seven countries and among new I@@ D@@ U@@ s , for whom data are not available for many countries , in Poland and the United

in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from op@@ i@@ oid drugs are at an ele@@ v@@ ated risk of an over@@ d@@ ose , if they rela@@ p@@ se back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
research suggests that con@@ current use of other drugs , particularly alcohol and sed@@ ative drugs , may increase the risk of fatal op@@ i@@ oid over@@ d@@ ose and , therefore , pol@@ y@@ drug use is an important issue for services to address .
this approach has not been widely developed in Europe to date , but may have potential .
an approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , where@@ by drug users may consum@@ e their drugs in a designated space where
drug consumption rooms have been criticised by the IN@@ C@@ B in their recent annual reports , but are viewed by some EU M@@ ember States as a useful component of their responses to some forms of highly problematic drug use .

one has only to consider the wor@@ rying developments resulting from the trans@@ iting of cocaine through West Africa to be reminded of the col@@ lateral damage that this problem can cause .
we are proud to present this , the thir@@ teen@@ th , annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction .
this report is only possible through the hard work and dedic@@ ation of our partners in the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x network of national fo@@ cal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis .
for most forms of drug use , our overall assessment is that we are not seeing increases , and in some areas the trends appear to be down@@ ward .
it is grati@@ fying to note that , by international standards , Europe stands out as one of the parts of the world where monitoring capacities are most developed .
non@@ e@@ theless , we are aware of the limit@@ ations of our current information resources , and are constantly working with our partners to improve the quality and re@@ lev@@ ance of the data available .
an acceptance that our activities can , and do , make a difference is a prerequisite to securing investment and policy support .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA would like to than@@ k the following for their help in producing this report :
• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal Wor@@ king Party on Dru@@ gs - and the European Commission ;
• the Trans@@ lation Centre for the Bo@@ dies of the European Union and the Office for Official Pub@@ lic@@ ations of the European Commun@@ ities .
graph@@ ics and tables in this report may reflect a sub@@ set of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
reports of the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years .
in reports on treatment demand , " new clients " ref@@ ers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " ref@@ ers to all those entering treatment .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the pro@@ portion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denomin@@ ator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .
analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the time period in question .
figures for 2005 may sub@@ stitute for missing 2006 values in trend analysis of drug market data ; for the analysis of other trends , missing data may be inter@@ po@@ lated .
the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / stat@@ s@@ 08 ) presents the full set of source tables on which the statistical analysis in the annual report is based .
a strong voice from Europe in an important year for ref@@ le@@ ction and policy formation the us@@ er is often difficult , and M@@ ember States v@@ ary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflec@@ tions on how drug policies have performed to date , and what direc@@ tions should be pursu@@ ed in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly can@@ na@@ bis users , the lik@@ elihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
this distinc@@ tion has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
drug use prevention : evidence base gro@@ ws but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving re@@ integration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tic value .
the challenge for policymakers may be that those programmes that are known to deliver benefits often require both a greater investment of resources and more attention to training and quality control .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of a more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous population of drug users .
it is therefore likely that European drug treatment services will have to develop an increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated set of responses in the future if they are to match the increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated needs of their clients .
the portal , which includes a prevention mo@@ dul@@ e , provides an over@@ view of the latest evidence on programme e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interven@@ tions .
examples of evalu@@ ated practices across Europe are also provided .
recent data from school and ad@@ ult population surveys suggest that overall can@@ na@@ bis use has stabil@@ ised or is declining in some countries .
the number of drug users receiving treatment for their dependency has grown considerably in recent years , and many countries now have a significant pro@@ portion of their problem op@@ i@@ oid users in long @@@ -@@ @ term sub@@ stitution treatment .
this trend has led to a wi@@ den@@ ing of the available pharmaceutical options and has resulted in an increased focus on treatment quality and outcome , as opposed to treatment up@@ take , as a primary policy concern .
commen@@ tary : the drug situation in Europe
last year use : about 23 million European adults or one @@@ -@@ @ third of lif@@ etime users now visible , and is most evident in the 16 @@@ -@@ @ 24 age group .
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.@@ 8 % to 1@@ 1.2 %
last month use : around 2 million
last year use : over 2.@@ 6 million or one @@@ -@@ @ third of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : more than 1 million
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.2 % to 3.5 %
last year use : around 2 million or one @@@ -@@ @ fifth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths accounted for 3.5 % of all deaths of Europeans 15 @@@ -@@ @ 39 years old , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them
the extent and relative market share of dome@@ sti@@ cally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis remains unknown , and in response to this the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is carrying out a study on m@@ apping the can@@ na@@ bis market in Europe .
local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conce@@ al and do not necess@@ itate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more rec@@ re@@ ational basis .
however , pat@@ ter@@ ns of sti@@ mul@@ ant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most com@@ mon@@ ly used sti@@ mul@@ ant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use remains rare outside the Cz@@ ech@@ Republic and Slovakia , although the avail@@ ability or use of the drug is spor@@ adi@@ cally reported by other countries .
this would imply that , as well as targeting individual substan@@ ces , interven@@ tions need to consider sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs as a group rather than only as individual problems .
typically , the production of one kilo@@ gram of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or M@@ D@@ MA results in around 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 kilo@@ gram@@ s of waste material , including to@@ xic and inf@@ lam@@ m@@ able chem@@ ic@@ als which constitute an environmental haz@@ ard .
commen@@ tary : the drug situation in Europe the relative pro@@ portion of op@@ i@@ oid users - but not their actual numbers - had been falling , but this trend now appears to have lev@@ elled out .
in Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , for example , there are indic@@ ations of a growing problem caused by the avail@@ ability of 3 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ yl@@ f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that is il@@ lic@@ it@@ ly manufac@@ tured outside the EU .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fif@@ ty times higher than that found among the general population .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
given the speed at which new products can appear and be distributed , the monitoring of online activities is becoming an important area for development .
consequently , successful interven@@ tions in this area require the involvement of a broad alliance of participants and can benefit from the support of the communities in which they are implemented .
introduction themselves to achieving meas@@ ur@@ able results in reducing the supply and demand for illi@@ cit drugs by 2008 .
in this year , both the United N@@ ations and the European Union assess the results of their drug policies on the use of , and har@@ ms caused by , illi@@ cit drugs .
this assessment is to be followed by a one @@@ -@@ @ year ref@@ le@@ ction period , during which discussions will first be held among inter@@ governmental expert working groups and then in inter@@ ses@@ sional meetings .
this " drug summit " set a new agenda for the international community through the adoption of three key documents ( 2
chapter 1 : policies and laws
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with in@@ put from the EU M@@ ember States , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
all of these documents cover a time sp@@ an of three to four years and , with the exception of the Turkish action plan , they have been prece@@ ded by previous plans or programmes .
Italy 's first drug action plan has a time frame of one year , and is to be followed by a four @@@ -@@ @ year action plan ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) , which will be syn@@ chron@@ ised with the new EU action plan on drugs .
it met for the first time in December 2007 and again in May 2008 to discuss the evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs and the new action plan .
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in C@@ hap@@ ter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will ren@@ ew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will ren@@ ew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will ren@@ ew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
a further two countries provided roug@@ h estimates of overall public expendi@@ ture related to the drug problem ( Spain , Malta ) , though with no information on the activities on which the money was spent .
these figures must , however , still be taken as indic@@ ative because of the limited data on which they are based .
total general government expendi@@ ture in the year . in Ireland , government departments and State agencies are invited to report their annual dru@@ g@@ related expendi@@ ture to the co@@ ordinating Department of Community , R@@ ural and G@@ a@@ el@@ tac@@ ht Affairs .
these expenditures are not necessarily la@@ bel@@ led as dru@@ g@@ related in official accoun@@ tancy documents .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe any more than this was raised to a clear minimum of four years in prison , as for a trafficking off@@ ence .
most of the expenditures identified were originally " la@@ bel@@ led " as drug related , and were generally tr@@ ac@@ ed back by exha@@ us@@ tively re@@ viewing official accoun@@ tancy documents , thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs .
asks the question : do the changes in legal defin@@ itions and responses to drug users indicate a new , wider trend in how countries view users of drugs ?
however , during this period , not all countries have been reducing penalties : France and Poland decided not to change their laws after consultations ; and Denmark raised the " normal " penalties from cau@@ tions to fines ( which were then increased ) .
however , M@@ ember States differ considerably in how they have chosen to define these categories in the new laws that they have adopted in recent years .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all wi@@ den the scope for direc@@ ting drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
further descri@@ p@@ tions of the various treatment alternatives to punishment and the extent of their use can be found in the
EL@@ D@@ D 's " Top@@ ic over@@ view " and " Legal reports " sections ( 8
crimes committed that are , in some way , linked to drugs (
though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
most legislative activity has concentrated on those taking drugs and then driving ( Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Spain , France , Latvia , Lithuania , Portugal , Finland ) .

based on reports from 25 M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an over@@ view of the organisation of dru@@ g@@ related research in European countries .
in 15 of the 27 reporting countries , structures to co@@ ordinate dru@@ g@@ related research exist at national level .
constra@@ ints to dru@@ g@@ related research were reported by several countries .
among the problems identified were : organis@@ ational aspects , such as a lack of Co@@ ordination and sc@@ at@@ tered resources ( Germany , France , Austria ) ; the
detailed information on research in the drugs field carried out in European countries has been collected by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA through its network of Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .

in addition to public@@ ations speci@@ alising in illi@@ cit drugs and addi@@ ction , articles on illi@@ cit drug use are also published in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als from a wide array of discipl@@ ines and in professional magaz@@ ines .
in 2006 , research findings in the drugs field were published in more than 100 such European journ@@ als .
a total of 25 European pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ reviewed journ@@ als speci@@ alising in the drugs field and publishing in 11 languages other than English were identified .
the majority of these national journ@@ als publish English
the European Commission , Eurostat , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA are working to improve this situation in the framework of the next EU action plan on drugs ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
the changes in reported objectives may reflect the adoption of a more r@@ ational and evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based approach , but the extent to which this change in objectives reflects actual provision is unclear .
these include stand@@ ardis@@ ed programmes , pe@@ er approaches or interven@@ tions specifically for boys ; all of which aim
extensive provision : the intervention is provided in a majority of locations where the size of the target population is sufficient for its implementation .
full provision : the intervention is available in almost all locations where the size of the target population is sufficient for its implementation .
since 2004 , an increasing number of drug policies have indicated them as primary targets for prevention interven@@ tions , but the reported level of intervention provision has not increased during this period .
this selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / public@@ ations / selected @@@ -@@ @ issues ) .
drug use among children and in families remains the main focus of targeted prevention in Europe .
several research studies have shown that interven@@ tions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environ@@ ments and reduce social exclu@@ sion , also have a moder@@ ating effect on later sub@@ stance use ( T@@ ou@@ m@@ bour@@ ou et al . , 2007 ) .
recent literature re@@ views ( 19 ) , however , show that certain
children with behavi@@ our@@ al dis@@ orders , such as co@@ existing attention deficit ( hy@@ per@@ activity ) dis@@ order and conduct dis@@ order , are at high risk of developing sub@@ stance use problems .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA " Best practice " portal content of prevention projects .
in the Czech Republic , for instance , certi@@ fication of preven@@ tive activities is a condition for receiving subsidies from the State budget .
the first mo@@ dul@@ e of the portal focuses on universal prevention , in particular on evidence of e@@ ffic@@ acy which is based on several re@@ views published since 2000 .
the portal provides information on the e@@ ffic@@ acy of various interven@@ tions , but it should be noted that the evidence base remains sometimes limited and that making cho@@ ices between different interven@@ tions requires caution .
the new edition of the E@@ D@@ D@@ RA dat@@ aban@@ k , available on the portal , features examples of evalu@@ ated interven@@ tions in different countries and sett@@ ings , and may provide additional gu@@ idance .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only in@@ effective but may carry risks of un@@ wanted effects ( W@@ er@@ ch and O@@ w@@ en , 2002 ) .
out@@ patient sett@@ ings , including general practice , account for most of the treatment for drug use in Europe , mainly because sub@@ stitution treatment is usually delivered in these sett@@ ings .
around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe sub@@ stitution treatment and ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange programmes ( N@@ SP@@ s ) , which target over@@ d@@ ose deaths and the spread of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases .
in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
due to the specific profile of the Bal@@ tic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
financial support for harm@@ reduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malar@@ ia and tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users and in prison sett@@ ings . "
after meth@@ ad@@ one , bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is the second most com@@ mon@@ ly pres@@ cri@@ bed op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitute , and its use in the treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence has increased in recent years ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
finally , some M@@ ember States have recently looked at the consequences of the introduction of harm@@ reduction interven@@ tions .
the prevention and reduction of dru@@ g@@ related harm is a public health objective in all M@@ ember States and in the EU drug strategy and action plan ( European Commission , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .
of users , particularly women , heroin and cr@@ ack users , those who belong to ethnic minorities and those with co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric problems .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of in@@ mates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of in@@ mates have in@@ j@@ ected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social re@@ integration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
prisons represent an important setting for the delivery of health and social interven@@ tions to drug users .
from the data available , it can be estimated that more than 400 000 people with past or current experience of illi@@ cit drug use pass through EU prisons every year .
the responsibility for healthcare in prison lies , in most countries , with the Ministry of Justice .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
in Belgium , a 2006 direc@@ tive from the Ministry for Justice states that in@@ mates have the right to the same range of treatment options as are available outside prison .
however , there is no such enti@@ t@@ lement if the offen@@ der is expected to be released within three months or is considered un@@ fit or not motivated for treatment .
the aim of this law is to provide drug users with such services at the time when they are most needed , at the time of enforced withdrawal immediately upon entering custody .
these estimates have some important limit@@ ations linked , for instance , with vari@@ ations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops which are not grown in restricted geographical areas , like can@@ na@@ bis .
in the early and mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high pre@@ val@@ ence , whereas the European nor@@ m was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @@@ -@@ @ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems .
information on drug prec@@ ur@@ sors is obtained from the IN@@ C@@ B , which is involved in international initiatives to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als used in the manufac@@ ture of illi@@ cit drugs .
( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports ) . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Ni@@ ger@@ ia , An@@ g@@ ola ) , south @@@ -@@ @ east Asia ( Tha@@ il@@ and ) , south @@@ -@@ @ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americ@@ as ( Col@@ om@@ bia , J@@ am@@ a@@ ica ) ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
can@@ na@@ bis can be cultiv@@ ated in a wide range of environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultiv@@ ated in 17@@ 2 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
Europe , where in addition to home production ( 35
the area under can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in production declined from 13@@ 4 000 hectares in 2003 to and the Netherlands have been noted as source countries
76 400 hectares producing 1 0@@ 66 tonnes in 2005 ( UNODC and Government of Mor@@ oc@@ co , 2007 ) .
in the Netherlands , can@@ na@@ bis cultiv@@ ation is widespread in some parts of the country , with an estimated total of 6 000 cultiv@@ ation sites disman@@ tled in 2005 and 2006 .
in some countries , it seems that a majority of users are now consum@@ ing loc@@ ally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis .
can@@ na@@ bis that is produced loc@@ ally also has the advantage for the producer that it does not need to be transported across national borders .
seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in in Europe exceed her@@ bal seiz@@ ures both in terms of number and quanti@@ ty : with twice as many seiz@@ ures ( 3@@ 25 000 ) and the amount inter@@ cep@@ ted ( 7@@ 13 tonnes ) eight times higher .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 03 , the number of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seiz@@ ures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities inter@@ cep@@ ted increased until 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 , but there@@ after have been declining .
in the recovery of about 2.3 million can@@ na@@ bis plants ( and 22 tonnes of can@@ na@@ bis plants ( 64 % accounted by Spain ) .
the data on European drug seiz@@ ures mentioned in this chapter can be found in T@@ ables S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 1 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 2 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 3 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 4 , S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 5 and S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 6 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
in 2006 , the reported TH@@ C content of res@@ in samples ran@@ ged from 2.3 % to 18.@@ 4 % , while that of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ran@@ ged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the meth@@ od@@ ology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conserv@@ atively estimated that can@@ na@@ bis has been used at least once ( lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ ye@@ ar@@ - ol@@ ds ( see T@@ able 2 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .
generally being reported among the 15@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
many countries report comparatively high pre@@ val@@ ence levels of last year and last month use of can@@ na@@ bis .
estimates of last month pre@@ val@@ ence will include those using the drug more regularly , though not necessarily in an intensive way ( see below ) .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) have ever used can@@ na@@ bis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
group have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
for example , the rati@@ o of mal@@ es to fem@@ al@@ es among those reporting use of can@@ na@@ bis in the last year ran@@ ged from 6.@@ 4 mal@@ es for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy .
as with lif@@ etime experience , there is a wide vari@@ ation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually un@@ reported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among mal@@ es .
after tobacco and alcohol , can@@ na@@ bis also continues to be the psy@@ cho@@ active sub@@ stance most com@@ mon@@ ly used by school students .
ever in lif@@ etime use of can@@ na@@ bis by 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experim@@ enting with this sub@@ stance often occur@@ s at or around this age .
data from the 2005 / 06 H@@ B@@ SC survey of 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds showed large vari@@ ation in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use across 27 countries .
European figures can be compared with those from other parts of the world .
esti@@ m@@ ating intensive and long @@@ -@@ @ term pat@@ ter@@ ns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .

the comparison shows that , on average , students who have used can@@ na@@ bis are more likely to have used other substan@@ ces .
although among can@@ na@@ bis users the last month pre@@ val@@ ence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and bin@@ ge drinking among can@@ na@@ bis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
in an Australian study , 92 % of long @@@ -@@ @ term can@@ na@@ bis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them jud@@ ged to be dependent at the time of the study .

decreas@@ es in experim@@ ental or occasi@@ onal use of can@@ na@@ bis are not necessarily directly related to trends in the regular use of the drug .

amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users entering treatment are , on average , around 29 year sold and male .
in most countries , though not in Sweden and Finland , the pro@@ portion of new clients entering treatment for primary amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use is greater than the pro@@ portion of all clients receiving treatment for this drug .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .
it is estimated that about 9.@@ 5 million European adults have tried ec@@ st@@ asy ( 3 % on average ) and that about 3 million ( 0.@@ 8 % ) have used it in the last year ( see T@@ able 4 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .

overall the estimated lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the U@@ SA .
the increasing trend in demand for cocaine treatment noted in previous years also appears to be continuing , even if it is dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately influenced by a few countries .
cocaine clients entering out@@ patient treatment have the highest male to female rati@@ o among drug treatment clients ( five men for every woman ) .

the second is a more margin@@ alised group of clients who are typically smoking or in@@ j@@ ecting cocaine ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either cr@@ ack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .

following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several M@@ ember States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adap@@ ting their traditionally op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ oriented services to the var@@ ied cocaine and cr@@ ack @@@ -@@ @ using populations .
however , with the exception of Spain , in 2006 , M@@ ember States assessed the avail@@ ability and acces@@ sibility of cocaine @@@ -@@ @ specific treatment programmes as low .
Mo@@ da@@ fin@@ il , a central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ant , has shown particularly promising results as a psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ant sub@@ stitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential sub@@ stitute drugs ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . d @@@ -@@ @ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ) , its abuse li@@ ability is low ( My@@ ri@@ ck et al . , 2004 ) .
of the M@@ ember States that report high pre@@ val@@ ence levels of cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evalu@@ ated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
in Italy , a lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e clin@@ ical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als ( ar@@ ip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and ro@@ pin@@ ir@@ ole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .
this techni@@ que repeatedly rein@@ forces the dru@@ g@@ free behaviour of the client and provides a regular goal to be achieved .

however , large seiz@@ ures of mor@@ ph@@ ine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; UNODC , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .

Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
for example , in some countries where problem op@@ i@@ oid use has histor@@ ically pre@@ dominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use at national level during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 range roughly between one and six cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use of between four and five cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 of the population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 can be der@@ ived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it imp@@ lies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
in 2003 , the down@@ ward trend in the number of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths reported in Europe , mostly related to the use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , ce@@ ased and between 2003 and 2005 most M@@ ember States have been reporting an up@@ ward trend .
this is an important issue for further investigation as available data do not allow a clear picture to be drawn .
treatment found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
furthermore , these models can provide only a partial estimate of inci@@ dence , as they are based on only those cases that come in to contact with treatment .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for inci@@ dence esti@@ mation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( S@@ cal@@ ia Tom@@ ba et al . , 2008 ) .
most drug clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 23 % ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 18 % ) .
of the 3@@ 87 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one : mainly bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , pain@@ kil@@ lers and other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 112 ) .

the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .

among op@@ i@@ oid users entering out@@ patient treatment for the first time in 2006 , a slightly lower pro@@ portion report in@@ j@@ ecting the drug ( around 40 % ) .
an analysis of the treatment demand data for nine countries taking part in a pilot study revealed that around 63 % of all op@@ i@@ oid clients ( those already in treatment

that among clients already in treatment the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors at treatment entrance was relatively high .
many countries conduct regularly repeated studies on groups of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , usually in the context of inf@@ ec@@ tious disease testing , that are often recru@@ ited from a variety of sett@@ ings in order to maxim@@ ise gener@@ alis@@ ability .
the var@@ ying levels of new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initi@@ ation as well as increasing in@@ j@@ ecting inci@@ dence among the younger or the older populations .
the latest available samp@@ le for each country during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 has been used , subject to there being at least 100 in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .

a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users and the reported number of treat@@ ments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving sub@@ stitution treatment .

pres@@ cri@@ ption of medical heroin ( di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine ) , as a treatment option for chron@@ ic treatment @@@ -@@ @ res@@ istant op@@ i@@ oid users , is available to a limited extent in the Netherlands ( 8@@ 15 clients in 2006 ) , the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 400 clients ) and Germany , where the participants of the heroin trial continue to receive di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine according to a special regulation .
additionally , a r@@ and@@ om@@ ised trial of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( R@@ I@@ O@@ T@@ T ) is currently under@@ way in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom which will assess the effectiveness of in@@ j@@ ec@@ table di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , in@@ j@@ ec@@ table meth@@ ad@@ one and oral meth@@ ad@@ one .
in February 2008 , it was also decided to introduce a di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine pres@@ cri@@ ption scheme in Denmark .

however , a report issued by the European Commission ( 200@@ 7@@ a ) highlighted the lack of services for drug users available in prisons and drew attention to the importance of interven@@ ing in this setting .
re@@ views of r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials and ob@@ serv@@ ational studies conclude that meth@@ ad@@ one maintenance treatment ( M@@ M@@ T ) and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance treatment ( BM@@ T ) can both be effective for the management of op@@ i@@ oid dependence .
a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review concluded , however , that bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is less effective than meth@@ ad@@ one delivered at adequate dos@@ es ( Mat@@ tic@@ k et al . , 2008 ) .
a number of studies have also found that di@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance can be effective for people failing to respond to M@@ M@@ T ( Sch@@ ul@@ te et al . , in press ) .
more positively , prison drug programmes have become more widespread , and new initiatives are reported by many countries .
in many countries , de@@ to@@ x@@ ification is the preferred and sometimes the only treatment option available .
by the end of 2006 , the inci@@ dence of diagnos@@ ed HIV infection among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users ( I@@ D@@ U@@ s ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
data on newly diagnos@@ ed cases related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 02 , which was due to out@@ breaks in Estonia , countries , HIV pre@@ val@@ ence remained unchanged during the period .
for details on methods and defin@@ itions , see the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
although in two of these , regional increases were also reported : in Bulgaria , one city , Sofia ; and in Italy , eight out of 21 regions and one city .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnos@@ ed inf@@ ections related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use with trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among I@@ D@@ U@@ s suggests that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .
however , vig@@ il@@ ance is needed as some M@@ ember States continue to show high rates of new HIV inf@@ ections linked to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use , and the situation is even more wor@@ rying in some neighbouring countries .
H@@ C@@ V anti@@ body levels among national samples of I@@ D@@ U@@ s in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 v@@ ary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in exc@@ ess of 40 % .
while estimates generated from non @@@ -@@ @ prob@@ ability samples must always be taken with caution , the vari@@ ations in pre@@ val@@ ence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes .
the pro@@ portion of I@@ D@@ U@@ s among all noti@@ fied cases of hep@@ ati@@ tis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vacc@@ ination programmes targeted at I@@ D@@ U@@ s .
access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade .
as a result many of those who become infected with the virus will not have the advantage of early treatment and care .
prisons are important sett@@ ings for interven@@ tions targeting inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
Dru@@ g@@ related deaths and mortality a majority of countries , although services in this area are still being developed .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA defin@@ ition of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths ( 13@@ 6 ) ref@@ ers to those deaths that are directly caused ( po@@ is@@ on@@ ings or over@@ dos@@ es ) by the consumption of one or more drugs , where at least one of the substan@@ ces present is an illi@@ cit
moreover , many dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths are , in fact , pol@@ y@@ drug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
the second component is broader and covers deaths which can@@ not be directly attri@@ but@@ able to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @@@ -@@ @ term consequences of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , inter@@ actions with mental health issues ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . road traffic accidents ) .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circum@@ stan@@ tial reasons ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . violence related to the drug trade ) .
there is still limited research on the mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and other consequences of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal over@@ dos@@ es and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .
deaths related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids
however , other approaches are being explo@@ red where@@ by data from various sources can be combined to estimate the total burden of mortality attri@@ but@@ able to drugs in a community ( see " Over@@ all dru@@ g@@ related mortality , " P . 86 ) .
in general , dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths occur shortly after the consumption of the sub@@ stance ( s ) .
improvements in the quality and reli@@ ability of European data in recent years have allowed better descri@@ p@@ tions of overall and national trends , and most countries have now adopted a case defin@@ ition in line with that of the
compar@@ is@@ ons of population rates should be made with caution , as there are some differences in case defin@@ itions and quality of reporting .
Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports 2007 , taken from national mortality regist@@ ries or special regist@@ ries ( foren@@ sic or police ) and Eurostat .
the majority of op@@ i@@ oid over@@ d@@ ose deaths ( 60 @@@ -@@ @ 95 % ) are male , mostly between 20 and 40 years of age , with a mean age in most countries in the mid @@@ -@@ @ thir@@ ties ( 14@@ 2
most of these deaths are attri@@ but@@ able to the misuse of meth@@ ad@@ one di@@ ver@@ ted from hospitals , pharmac@@ ies , practi@@ tion@@ ers and p@@ ain management physi@@ cians , while only a limited number of them are attributed to meth@@ ad@@ one obtained from sub@@ stitution programmes ( 14@@ 6 ) .
cocaine @@@ -@@ @ indu@@ ced deaths are more difficult to define and identify than those related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine ) .
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related .
while similar studies in other countries would be very useful , the available evidence suggests that meth@@ ad@@ on@@ er@@ e@@ lated deaths are more likely to be linked to defic@@ i@@ encies in pres@@ cri@@ bing practices than to overall levels of sub@@ stitution treatment .
most deaths with " presence of ec@@ st@@ asy " are reported in the United Kingdom , but in many cases the drug has not been identified as the direct cause of death .
Europe had a very high mortality rate compared to pe@@ ers of the same age ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) .
a number of factors could be associated with this , including : increases in pol@@ y@@ drug use , a possible growth in the avail@@ ability of heroin or an ag@@ eing population of chron@@ ic drug users ( 15@@ 2
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
it should be noted that the pro@@ portion of AIDS deaths can be considerably higher in countries with a high HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among drug users .
co@@ h@@ ort studies area valuable tool for esti@@ m@@ ating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an over@@ view at national level .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extra@@ po@@ lated from co@@ h@@ ort studies to local ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( C@@ ru@@ ts et al . , 2008 ) .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clin@@ ical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths .
a total of 18@@ 9 deaths were recorded up to 2003 , of which the cause of death could not be identified in 14 cases .
AIDS mortality pe@@ aked in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s and has decreased substan@@ tially following the introduction and increased coverage of H@@ A@@ AR@@ T .
the number of deaths from other causes ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . consequences of other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and esti@@ mation in this area ( see prec@@ eding section ) .
drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , in particular , may suffer from high levels of som@@ atic disease , notably chron@@ ic inf@@ ections of the li@@ ver , which further increase their vulner@@ ability .

of the 4@@ 42 deaths that occurred among the samp@@ le during this period , the majority ( 59 % ) were drug @@@ -@@ @ related .
in the period immediately after release , expected rates were exceeded by more than 10 times for women and more than eight times for men .
new pat@@ ter@@ ns of drug use are difficult to detec@@ t because , typically , they first emerge at low levels , and in specific lo@@ cal@@ ities or among restricted sub @@@ -@@ @ groups of the population .
new substan@@ ces under control example on the working methods of online shops ; the way that they respond to users " demands , and new trends among young people .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA conducted a sn@@ ap@@ shot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
of these substan@@ ces , m@@ C@@ P@@ P had been actively monitored by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , and B@@ Z@@ P had been the subject of a risk assessment in 2007 .

furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitu@@ tes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's future activities .
as well as making an important contribution to a mature and informed debate on the drug problem , the existence of this monitoring system , we believe , results in better and more effective policies .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confron@@ ted .
the conference also identified a number of important issues that are echoed in the analysis presented here .
in this year 's report , we give greater pro@@ min@@ ence to an analysis of supply @@@ -@@ @ side indicators and the drug market .
we do this cau@@ ti@@ ously , as insufficient efforts have yet been made to improve the quality , reli@@ ability and compar@@ ability of the European data set in this area .
this can be seen in the development of a trans@@ versal drug monitoring system that en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es 30 countries with a combined population of more than half a billion people .
it can also be seen in the EU drugs strategy and action plan , tools that are designed to take stock of the information available and elabor@@ ate it into practical and collective action .

this annual report is based on information provided to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA by the EU M@@ ember States , the candidate countries Croatia and Turkey , and Norway in the form of a national report .
graph@@ ics and tables in this report may reflect a sub@@ set of EU countries ; the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
reports of the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged from 15 to 64 years .
in reports on treatment demand , " new clients " ref@@ ers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " ref@@ ers to all those entering treatment .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the pro@@ portion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denomin@@ ator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .

policy consensus permits a more targeted drug action plan to be moving closer to the European model .
the reporting mechanism developed to assess the implementation of the UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS action plans has been criticised .
although attention is often given to the differences that exist between M@@ ember States in their drug policies , from a historical perspective the considerable agreement that is now evident in discussions at European level is striking .
this approach is concre@@ tely illu@@ strated in the attention given to specific areas of practice such as the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , working in prison sett@@ ings and improving the quality of treatment and other interven@@ tions .
and although the data are difficult to interpre@@ t , this ob@@ servation raises questions about the extent to which law enforcement practice is in step with policy objectives in this area .
this has helped to ensure that , in the final agreement , the key pro@@ gressive elements of the original 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS documents were preserved .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
broad@@ ly speaking , the European policy debate has moved towards the view that priority should be given to inter@@ diction activities targeting the supply rather than the use of drugs .
reflecting this , in some countries the legal penalties applic@@ able to supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences have been raised or minimum tariffs have been introduced .
the extent to which this shift in emphasis away from users and towards drug suppliers is being translated into policing practice is difficult to ga@@ uge .
overall , the number of supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences has increased ; but the number of offences related to possession or use of drugs has also increased , and to an even greater degree .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe integrated package of care .
cust@@ odi@@ al sentences are common for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences , but they tend to be given at the lower end of the available tariffs , aver@@ aging 3 years or less .
a les@@ son that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practi@@ tion@@ ers can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
despite the fact that in most countries it is the@@ ore@@ tically possible to continue or start sub@@ stitution treatment within the prison setting , in practice this is often difficult .
as those charged with drug offences are likely to be a di@@ verse group , needs assessment is a particularly important issue for service development in this area .
the use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dis@@ su@@ asion of drug abuse . "
the tribunal can issue fines , but sanc@@ tioning is not its main objective .
in addition , developments in ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addi@@ ction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
examples here include a cocaine vacc@@ ine , now undergoing a large @@@ -@@ @ scale trial in Europe .
treatment and health interven@@ tions : from " one f@@ its all " towards a to@@ ol@@ box of targeted measures
services for drug users in Europe are becoming increasingly diversi@@ fied and offered as part of an
commen@@ tary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem or near @@@ -@@ @ daily basis , with much higher levels found among young mal@@ es . this represents a large population at risk , and highlights the need for better understanding of the service needs of this group .
the estimates presented here rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
subsequently , the situation began to stabilise , and the most recent data strongly support the analysis presented in last year 's report , of an overall decline in the use of this drug .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , just as different tempor@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns could be seen in the up@@ ward trend in can@@ na@@ bis use in the past , this pat@@ tern now appears to be repe@@ ating itself in rever@@ se .
the United Kingdom , for example , one of the first countries to record high pre@@ val@@ ence levels was also one of the ear@@ li@@ est to report a decline in use .
standing out in the European picture is a small group of countries , mainly in the north or south of Europe , where levels of can@@ na@@ bis use have remained low and stable for some time .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.@@ 0 % to 1.3 %
problem op@@ i@@ oid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
principal drug in more than 50 % of all drug treatment requests
a c@@ av@@ eat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
although to what extent this reflects pat@@ ter@@ ns of use or the capacity of services remains unclear .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA estimates that somewhere between 2 % and 2.5 % of young adults are using can@@ na@@ bis on a daily
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a dimin@@ ishing problem trend in heroin @@@ -@@ @ related problems is no longer sustained .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the ep@@ i@@ demic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems ar@@ ising from the use of this drug are considerable .
any indic@@ ations that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that sub@@ stance use problems are best addressed hol@@ isti@@ cally and in the context of healthy lif@@ est@@ y@@ les and informed cho@@ ices .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional perspective is becoming increasingly un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful in understanding the developing nature of pat@@ ter@@ ns of sub@@ stance use in Europe .
in Europe today , pol@@ y@@ drug pat@@ ter@@ ns are the nor@@ m , and the combined use of different substan@@ ces is responsible for , or complic@@ ates , most of the problems we face .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly dev@@ alu@@ ed if they simply open the door for the use of a sub@@ stitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substan@@ ces that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
however , there is evidence of the further di@@ ff@@ usion of the drug into other countries . treatment demands related to cocaine are also growing .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the avail@@ ability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreas@@ es , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and pro@@ portion of treatment demands related to op@@ i@@ oid drugs .
data on dru@@ g@@ related deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreas@@ ing trend observed prior to 2004 .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be di@@ ff@@ using into new populations .
among older , regular drug users , pol@@ y@@ drug use is a major issue in drug over@@ d@@ ose , it complic@@ ates drug treatment and is associated with violence and off@@ ending .
among school@@ children , the latest data show a strong association between bin@@ ge drinking and drug use . bin@@ ge
commen@@ tary : responding to Europe 's changing drug problem drinking also often goes hand in hand with rec@@ re@@ ational drug use , increasing the risks of negative out@@ comes among young adults .
innovation and prec@@ ur@@ sor avail@@ ability : inter@@ acting factors that are having a growing impact on the market for syn@@ thetic drugs
the illi@@ cit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adap@@ t quickly to control measures .
effects on the avail@@ ability and use of other substan@@ ces .
again , market factors and prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als appear important here , with meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine production sites appe@@ aring now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilit@@ ates the import of prec@@ ur@@ sors , in this case 1 @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ en@@ y@@ l @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ pro@@ pan@@ one ( BM@@ K ) , from outside of the European Union .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible ou@@ tw@@ ard di@@ ff@@ usion of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use beyond the Czech Republic .
in this country , meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine problems are long established , but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption .
until 2007 , most ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets analy@@ sed in Europe contained 3,4 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ y@@ len@@ edi@@ ox@@ y @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ( M@@ D@@ MA ) or another ec@@ st@@ asy @@@ -@@ @ like sub@@ stance .
changes in the ec@@ st@@ asy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als , and these efforts may also have important
this year , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harm@@ reduction interven@@ tions , the web @@@ -@@ @ based approaches have considerable potential .
added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicin@@ es are those about the appearance of a range of sup@@ pos@@ edly " legal " alternatives to controlled psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe ob@@ sc@@ ure research compo@@ unds , some are extremely po@@ tent , and little is known about their effects on hum@@ ans .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @@@ -@@ @ based products , in particular her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures , as well as mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise containing syn@@ thetic compo@@ unds .
new substan@@ ces appe@@ aring on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experim@@ ental chem@@ ic@@ als syn@@ th@@ es@@ ised in laborat@@ ories and un@@ tested in hum@@ ans .
a no@@ table example of this is the her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures that have been mar@@ ke@@ ted under the " sp@@ ice " la@@ bel .
foren@@ sic analysis , however , has largely failed to detec@@ t the plant @@@ -@@ @ based substan@@ ces declared on the la@@ bel@@ s , but did identify in some samples syn@@ thetic can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ ids that had been added to the mi@@ x@@ tures .
the can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ ids found are relatively
moreover , as some of these substan@@ ces may have legitimate uses or be sold sup@@ pos@@ edly for legitimate purposes , they can fall between drug control and trade regulation .
other topics addressed are the recent adoption and evaluation of national drug strategies and action plans , new data and trends on dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture and developments regarding dru@@ g@@ related research in Europe .
new UN political declaration and plan of action
the enforcement of drug prohibi@@ tion is jud@@ ged by the study to have caused substantial un@@ intended harm ; much of which could have been predicted ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . geographical dis@@ placement of production and trafficking ) .
the new EU action plan identi@@ fies five key priorities that reflect its areas of action : improving Co@@ ordination , co@@ operation and raising public awareness ; reducing the demand for drugs ; reducing the supply of drugs ; improving international co@@ operation ; and , improving the understanding of the problem . the new plan is more
EU drugs action plan ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) : new features
the new UN document is similar in content to the original UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS declar@@ ations and action plans agreed in 1998 .
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which re@@ views current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN M@@ ember States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
it also examined the action plan 's impact on the national drug policies of EU M@@ ember States and looked at recent trends in Europe 's drug situation .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial co@@ operation between M@@ ember States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
the evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives at@@ tained , progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that ech@@ o those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing conver@@ gence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better ref@@ le@@ ction of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursu@@ ed in external agreements and programmes .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe focused than its predecessor , with only about half the number of objectives ( 24 ) and fewer actions ( 72 ) .
evalu@@ ator will conduct a final assessment of the current drug action plan and strategy in 2012 , and this will be followed by a period of ref@@ le@@ ction in order to prepare the next EU drug policy documents .
national drug strategies and action plans
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dis@@ su@@ ade young people from beginning to use drugs by re@@ affir@@ ming the prohibi@@ tion of drug use and in@@ forming young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Dru@@ gs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 200@@ 8@@ a ) .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of fin@@ alising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 programme with a 1 @@@ -@@ @ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU M@@ ember States .
in most cases , a progress report based on data collected from service providers and ministries involved in drug policy is submitted to the government or parliament .
most countries could provide data on central government expendi@@ ture , and seven also reported expendi@@ ture by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
la@@ bel@@ led and un@@ la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture
in some cases , the final report is a sum@@ m@@ ary of annual implementation re@@ views ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the countries taking the more in @@@ -@@ @ dep@@ th approach to evaluation , two ( Luxembourg , Cyprus ) have decided to work with external evalu@@ ators from outside the country .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is also developing guidelines to help M@@ ember States assess and interpre@@ t the results of their drug policy documents .

in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exemp@@ ts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of sy@@ r@@ inges dis@@ pen@@ sed .
overall , police confis@@ cation of ster@@ ile sy@@ r@@ inges or ne@@ ed@@ les is reported to be rare across the European Union .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new off@@ ence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EU@@ R 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .

analysis of drugs research in the European Union published by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA in 2008 ( 10 ) .
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports .
the United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
participation in European research activities was found to v@@ ary considerably between countries , with much of the international co@@ operation taking place on an informal basis .
the effectiveness of this type of intervention , however , is not supported by the available evidence .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @@@ -@@ @ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evalu@@ ating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combin@@ es training in life @@@ -@@ @ skills with norm@@ ative education and knowledge acquisition on substan@@ ces .
the responses developed in the framework of drug law enforcement are also addressed in a new section which includes the most recent data on drug law offences .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
gender @@@ -@@ @ dependent effects also came up in a Danish controlled trial on a life @@@ -@@ @ skills programme .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bul@@ lying , past @@@ -@@ @ week and past @@@ -@@ @ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drin@@ ks on one occasion and having tried can@@ na@@ bis .
it aims to de@@ ter or delay the on@@ set of drug use and dru@@ g@@ related problems by providing young people with the information and skills necessary to avoid starting to use drugs .
selec@@ tive and indicated prevention
new information on selec@@ tive prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
both selec@@ tive and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ c ) .
selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ es with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scar@@ ce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavi@@ our@@ al or psychological problems that may be predic@@ tive for developing problem sub@@ stance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interven@@ tions .
similarly , the " Ko@@ met f@@ ör f@@ ör@@ ä@@ ld@@ rar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing ex@@ ter@@ n@@ alising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive pe@@ er relations .
its evaluation found that negative social norms against can@@ na@@ bis smoking were rein@@ forced and that there were no negative effects on intention to use and on norm@@ ative beli@@ efs ( W@@ am@@ mes et al . , 2007 ) .
there was , however , evidence that the campaign had un@@ intended effects in favour of can@@ na@@ bis , and individuals who had previously been un@@ interested in the drug , reported an intention to use it ( Hor@@ nik et al . , 2008 ) .

according to national experts , this type of treatment is available to the majority of those who seek it in 10 countries , and available to nearly all of them in a further 13 countries .
in four countries ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Romania , Turkey ) , however , out@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ A ) .
it is generally provided as an out@@ patient treatment , though in some countries it is also available in in@@ patient sett@@ ings .
in Turkey , sub@@ stitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is per@@ mitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . in 16 countries , specialised public out@@ patient services are the main providers of sub@@ stitution treatment .

most in@@ patient clients are men , with an overall male to female rati@@ o of 3.6 : 1 .
the rati@@ o is lower among primary users of non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.@@ 1 : 1 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 8 : 1 ) .
national experts estimate that in@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
the scar@@ city of national guidelines is probably due to the limited evidence available , and this points to the need for more mul@@ tis@@ ite r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials in these fields .

in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their ten@@ ancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consen@@ su@@ al crime , " where con@@ sent@@ ing individuals secre@@ tly participate in an un@@ law@@ ful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . during a fo@@ ot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh study , which found that recover@@ ing drug users who received employment @@@ -@@ @ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( Mc@@ In@@ tos@@ h et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at dis@@ rup@@ ting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and sear@@ ches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more gener@@ ic tac@@ tic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
this involves processing impor@@ tation and expor@@ tation requests as well as identi@@ fying and investigating suspicious transactions .

population surveys : an important tool for understanding drug use pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends in Europe
drug use in the general or school population can be meas@@ ured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the pro@@ portion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .

in Denmark , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use increased from 0.5 % in 1994 to 3.@@ 1 % in 2000 , with a similar figure in 2008 ( 87 ) .

users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines generally receive treatment in out@@ patient drug services which , in countries with histor@@ ies of significant levels of the use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , can be specialised in tre@@ ating this type of drug problem .
an indication of the extent to which the use of these drugs may be concentrated among the young , club @@@ -@@ @ going population can be g@@ le@@ an@@ ed from the 2007 / 08 British Crime Sur@@ v@@ ey .
in the other six countries , national experts estimate that specialised amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines treatment is available to less than half of the users seeking it .
promising results have been reported for recent investigations on pharmac@@ ological agents to manage abst@@ in@@ ence or reduce the cra@@ v@@ ings associated with amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines dependence , which up to now have been lacking .
D@@ examp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines in England and Wal@@ es , where it may be pres@@ cri@@ bed by any doctor . however , information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited .

a survey of 2@@ 65 N@@ H@@ S specialist services , carried out in 2000 , revealed that de@@ x@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine pres@@ cri@@ bing was available in about one third of the services surveyed ( Ros@@ en@@ berg et al . , 2002 ) .
the literature is particularly hin@@ dered by the pa@@ uc@@ ity of wel@@ l@@ conducted studies among primary amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users , especially treatment outcome studies ( Bak@@ er et al . , 2004 ) .
those who only experim@@ ent with the sub@@ stance on one or a few occasions make up the largest group .
some of them will intensify their use of cocaine , or use it over a long period , which may lead to chron@@ ic health and social problems and to the need for treatment .

competent national authorities are nominated to act as contact points , permanently on @@@ -@@ @ call , in order to rep@@ ly to such requests as soon as possible .
requests may be granted , granted with conditions or refused .
the fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal , and to a les@@ ser extent Spain and France , reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year ( 90 ) .
in countries where amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines dominate the market in illi@@ cit sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Con@@ ver@@ sely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illi@@ cit sti@@ mul@@ ant , low levels of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use are reported .
only a small pro@@ portion of those who have used cocaine at least once in their life appear to develop intensive pat@@ ter@@ ns of use .
the lack of data in this area makes this analysis necessarily spec@@ ula@@ tive and under@@ lines the importance of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that influence Europe 's drug market .
the European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.@@ 8 % ( 1 million ) .
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illi@@ cit drug in Europe , after can@@ na@@ bis , though levels of use v@@ ary greatly between countries .
it is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lif@@ etime , on average 3.@@ 9 % of adults aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years ( see T@@ able 8 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .
national figures v@@ ary from 0.@@ 1 % to 8.@@ 3 % , with 12 out of 23 countries , including most central and eastern European countries , reporting low levels of lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence among all adults ( 0.5 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % ) .
cocaine use is also associated with alcohol use and certain lif@@ est@@ y@@ les .
for p@@ urity and price data , see T@@ ables P@@ P@@ P @@@ -@@ @ 3 and P@@ P@@ P @@@ -@@ @ 7 in the 2009 statistical bul@@ letin .

lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students in the ES@@ PA@@ D survey is between 1 % and 2 % in half of the 28 reporting countries .

chapter 5 : cocaine and cr@@ ack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
cr@@ ack cocaine use in Europe
in 2007 , around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered out@@ patient treatment for primary use of cr@@ ack cocaine , representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in out@@ patient treatment .
it has been fear@@ ed that a similar phenomenon could happen in Europe but , until now , a serious cr@@ ack ep@@ i@@ demic has not been observed .
cr@@ ack cocaine is , however , used in some European cities , although it is difficult to know the exact size of the phenomenon .
the first group typically reports s@@ nor@@ ting the drug , and sometimes consum@@ ing it in con@@ jun@@ ction with other substan@@ ces such as alcohol or can@@ na@@ bis , but not with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
siz@@ able cr@@ ack problems have also been reported by cities in other European countries .
some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Ireland , Italy , Spain ) , however , have implemented strategies or treatment programmes targeting cocaine users , and France is in the process of developing such programmes .
for this reason , in Ireland out@@ reach work and other interven@@ tions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly et al . , 2008 ) .
among them , 42 % also use alcohol , 28 % can@@ na@@ bis and 16 % heroin . cocaine is also often mentioned as a secondary drug ,

for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where op@@ i@@ oid users are the main cli@@ en@@ te@@ le . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
in the United Kingdom , a clin@@ ical trial is investigating the effectiveness of cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y in con@@ jun@@ ction with contin@@ gency management ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ b ) in primary cocaine users .
according to a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review , this combination has yi@@ elded the best results for the treatment of sti@@ mul@@ ant dependence ( K@@ n@@ ap@@ p et al . , 2007 ) .
it is the largest trial conducted on this vacc@@ ine to date , with several hundred volunteers participating .
these difficulties can be tack@@ led by the development of specific treatment programmes and training courses adap@@ ted to the problems associated with cocaine and cr@@ ack use .
cocaine @@@ -@@ @ specific training for treatment staff is reported from Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom .
in addition , 11 M@@ ember States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
a decline in heroin use and associated problems has been observed in the last 10 years , though more recent data suggest that , in some countries , the trend may have changed direction .
the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 7@@ 35 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported who@@ le@@ sale price of heroin ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 12.@@ 5 to EU@@ R 3@@ 5.@@ 8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 36 to EU@@ R 6@@ 2.7 .
at both who@@ le@@ sale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
the rati@@ o between retail and who@@ le@@ sale price also var@@ ies considerably , from 1.6 : 1 in the Czech Republic to 2.8 : 1 in the United Kingdom .
non@@ e@@ theless , analysis in this area can be in@@ form@@ ative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
0 E@@ sti@@ mates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use in European countries during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 07 range roughly between one and six cases per 1 000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ; overall pre@@ val@@ ence of problem drug use is estimated to range from under three cases to 10 cases per 1 000 .
overall , of the around 3@@ 25 000 treatment ent@@ ries for which the primary drug is known , 49 % cited heroin as their primary drug ; if other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids are included , time ( 112 ) .
1 11 those clients who were in treatment for more than 1 year was reported to be over 50 % in all countries participating in the study .
clients entering treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use often report the use of other drugs .
a recent analysis of data on clients in drug treatment in 14 countries found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users and alcohol ( 7 % ) ( 1@@ 13 ) .
it has also launched , in collaboration with the University of Z@@ ur@@ ich , a study to test a new " one @@@ -@@ @ day " method using the distribution of " la@@ ten@@ cy time " ( time to treatment ) in a cross @@@ -@@ @ sec@@ tional samp@@ le of treated heroin users .
in at least five regions , the inci@@ dence estimates allowed the der@@ iv@@ ation of pre@@ val@@ ence estimates that were in a good accordance with other existing estimates ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . by the capture @@@ -@@ @ rec@@ ap@@ ture method ) .
similarly , a decline noted in the number of heroin seiz@@ ures in the European Union until 2003 has now been replaced by a steady increase . in the most recent data on drug law offences , an increase in the number of heroin @@@ -@@ @ related cases may also be observed .
this is perhaps most clearly visible since 2003 among seiz@@ ures and dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths , and after 2004 in new treatment demands related to heroin use .
in@@ j@@ ecting drug users are among those at highest risk of experiencing health problems from their drug use , such as blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis ) or dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths .
in Cyprus , an estimate made in 2007 indicates that there has been a significant increase in problem op@@ i@@ oid use , which has been linked with an increase in foreign nationals in treatment ( 1@@ 14 ) . information from the
in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is one of the main determin@@ ants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis C and over@@ d@@ ose .
the lowest propor@@ tions of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among op@@ i@@ oid users entering treatment are reported by Denmark and the Netherlands , and the highest by Lithuania , Latvia and Romania ( 120 ) .
treatment reports also suggest that among op@@ i@@ oid users , the popularity of in@@ j@@ ecting may v@@ ary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among new op@@ i@@ oid clients ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 9 % to 47.@@ 2 % .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
an increase was also observed in Cyprus .
the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Czech Republic , Germany ) .
between 2002 and 2007 , the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among primary op@@ i@@ oid clients entering treatment has decreased in most countries , with statisti@@ cally significant dec@@ lines reported in 13 countries .
in France , for example , a decrease in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting has been observed in the treatment data since 2001 , and studies reveal that initi@@ ation of heroin use has become increasingly

Com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ty : drug use and mental dis@@ orders
pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids may enter the illi@@ cit drug market through the di@@ version of sub@@ stitution drugs from their proper use .
internet pharmac@@ ies seem also to play a substantial role in the avail@@ ability of pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids in the United States ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 9@@ a ) , but their role in Europe appears to be limited .
the mental dis@@ orders most com@@ mon@@ ly reported among drug users in Europe include de@@ pression , anx@@ iety , s@@ chi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia , person@@ ality dis@@ orders , attention deficit and hy@@ per@@ activity .
national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
a European prospec@@ tive multi @@@ -@@ @ centre study ( Is@@ ad@@ ora ) has recently been conducted involving dual @@@ -@@ @ diagnos@@ is patients
its findings highlight the difficulties of compar@@ ative analy@@ ses in this area , under@@ lining the need for a more harmon@@ ised approach for diagnos@@ is , treatment and study of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty in Europe ( Bal@@ d@@ ac@@ ch@@ ino et al . , 2009 ) .
the German P@@ har @@@ -@@ @ M@@ on system , which monitors a wide range of medi@@ c@@ ations that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , where sub@@ stitution drugs play a more important role than anal@@ ges@@ ics ( Ro@@ es@@ ner and K@@ üf@@ ner , 2007 ) .
in the M@@ ember States that have joined the EU since 2004 are on average younger than their counterparts .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substan@@ ces is not com@@ promised ( Ch@@ ern@@ y et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .
high levels of psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty were primary op@@ i@@ oid users ( 125 ) .
almost all op@@ i@@ oid users entering treatment report initi@@ ation before the age of 30 and about half before the age of 20 .

drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is a ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic approach , which generally requires individuals to abst@@ ain from all substan@@ ces , including sub@@ stitution medi@@ cation .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in sub@@ stitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the avail@@ ability of op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of op@@ i@@ oid users ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
in those countries , drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is the treatment of choice for between 10 % and 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid users .

deaths indirectly related to drug use
other diseases that also account for a pro@@ portion of deaths among drug users include chron@@ ic conditions such as li@@ ver diseases ( due to hep@@ ati@@ tis C infection and heavy alcohol use ) , cancer and cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular problems .
other causes have received much less attention , despite indic@@ ations that they have a considerable impact .

Pack@@ aging information on " sp@@ ice " products indicates that they are composed of as many as 14 ing@@ redi@@ ents of plant origin .
while at least two of the ing@@ redi@@ ents - P@@ edi@@ cul@@ ar@@ is den@@ si@@ fl@@ ora and Leon@@ otis le@@ onur@@ us - may have some psy@@ cho@@ active effect , little is known about the pharmac@@ ology and to@@ x@@ ic@@ ology of the plant materials pur@@ por@@ tedly contained in " sp@@ ice " products .
the online market@@ place has implications for the potential spread of new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces , and monitoring it is an increasingly important element of identi@@ fying new drug trends .
in particular , it is necessary to focus on the risks associated with the substan@@ ces offered for sale .
in seven countries , national risk assessment may be carried out on an ad @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ c basis , when necessary .

in this policy brief@@ ing the different types of offences that might be en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed under a general heading of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime are explo@@ red .

the effects of such drugs include exc@@ it@@ ability , ir@@ rit@@ ability , fear / par@@ ano@@ ia , dis@@ in@@ hibition , dras@@ tic mood sw@@ ings , cogn@@ itive dist@@ or@@ tions and imp@@ aired jud@@ gement , any of which may lead to criminal behaviour .
it is also important to include in this category crimes indu@@ ced by the victim 's own drug use . such crimes are less visible , because many go un@@ reported .
however , such a defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime is essential to any attempt to assess its extent , pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends .
in practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some sub@@ groups of the population of drug @@@ -@@ @ using offen@@ ders or to some types of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
it is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may v@@ ary even in the same person over time .
this category of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime also includes the for@@ ging of pres@@ crip@@ tions and the bur@@ gling of pharmac@@ ies by drug users , both of which provide medicin@@ es that can be used as sub@@ stitu@@ tes for illi@@ cit products .
the use of op@@ i@@ ates and can@@ na@@ bis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psych@@ op@@ harmac@@ olog@@ ically indu@@ ced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tran@@ qu@@ il@@ lis@@ ers ) tend to reduce violent imp@@ ul@@ ses and aggres@@ sion .
however , ir@@ rit@@ ability associated with the withdrawal syn@@ dro@@ me , as well as related mental health problems , may be linked to increased violence .
although many acquis@@ itive crimes committed by drug users are opportun@@ istic , some require more sk@@ ill and others involve some speci@@ alisation .
while the pharmac@@ ology of most illi@@ cit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behavi@@ ours are not fully understood although some substan@@ ces , usually sti@@ mul@@ ants , are known to produce
additionally , from a policy perspective , it is hel@@ p@@ ful to include a legal defin@@ ition model , in which crimes against drug laws are considered to be another type of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
the resulting concep@@ tual model , composed of four categories of drug crimes , is the basis for the defin@@ ition of the term " dru@@ g@@ related crime " used here , the individual components of which are discussed below .
many studies have been carried out on the links between drug use / tra@@ ff@@ i cking and crime , mostly in the United States .
those whose drug use needs to be supported by illegal income , which will be determined by their type and pat@@ tern of sub@@ stance use , soci@@ o@@ economic situation and extent of dev@@ i@@ ant lif@@ estyle .
however , some studies have attempted to estimate the pro@@ portion of different types of off@@ ence that are drug @@@ -@@ @ related and then apply this frac@@ tion to produce overall estimates of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
in drug production and transit countries where the rule of law is challenged , system@@ ic crimes may also en@@ comp@@ ass , for example , corruption of businesses , governments and banking systems or crimes against humanity by drug traffic@@ ker@@ s@@ . c@@ kers .
Studies of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime have often over@@ looked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by defin@@ ition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
system@@ ic violence is linked to prohibi@@ tion as it stems mainly from the illi@@ cit nature of a market characterised by huge profits and whose participants can@@ not resort to standard business law .
the four categories of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime suggested , and the models on which they are der@@ ived , are not mutually exclusive .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the pro@@ portion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
this would make such crimes relatively less costly ( through reduced prob@@ ability of arrest and shor@@ tened inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation ) and therefore may increase their inci@@ dence .
cocaine use in Europe : implications for service delivery
no proven effective sub@@ stitution or pharmac@@ ological treatment options currently available for cocaine users .
pow@@ der cocaine is typically s@@ nor@@ ted ( in@@ su@@ ff@@ lated ) and , less frequently , in@@ j@@ ected .
it produces e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia and appe@@ ti@@ te sup@@ pression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .
three core groups of problem cocaine users can be identified : socially well @@@ -@@ @ integrated individuals ; op@@ i@@ oid users , some of whom are sub@@ stitution treatment clients ; and margin@@ alised cr@@ ack users .
ac@@ ute and chron@@ ic cocaine use , often in combination with other substan@@ ces , can cause multiple dis@@ orders ( cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular , ne@@ ur@@ ological , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric , et@@ c . ) .
cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
this group is mainly composed of mal@@ es , often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system or under the pressure of social and family networks .

they might seek treatment and support at a later stage of their dependence and thus be more difficult to treat .
it is the smal@@ lest of the three groups ( 2.5 % of all European clients in treatment ) and has only been identified in a few locations .
research on pharmaceutical agents should also be supported and the results made rapidly available , both for positive as well as negative out@@ comes .
finally , cocaine users who are undergoing op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment should be assessed to make sure that their cocaine use is not linked with too low a dos@@ age of meth@@ ad@@ one or bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine .

drug addi@@ ction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibi@@ ting a loss of control over their consumption . ad@@ dicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
most ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research on addi@@ ction has focused on the role a drug @@@ -@@ @ released ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter called dop@@ am@@ ine has on the repeated activ@@ ation of the " reward system " - cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry made up of a complex set of cer@@ e@@ br@@ al structures which act as a baro@@ meter , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
sp@@ urred on by recent technological developments oc@@ curr@@ ing rapidly in this field , new@@ models have ar@@ isen which take into account the implic@@ ation of other ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters in the process , also expl@@ oring the role of gen@@ etic differences between individuals .
a growing body of research suggests that chron@@ ic drug use can produce long @@@ -@@ @ term dis@@ rup@@ tions in the mo@@ du@@ lation of ne@@ ur@@ o@@ cogn@@ itive cir@@ cu@@ its involved in motiv@@ ation and attention , decision @@@ -@@ @ making and the ability to in@@ hibi@@ t imp@@ ul@@ ses .

they stimulate different cer@@ e@@ br@@ al structures , such as the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a and the hip@@ po@@ camp@@ us , which are part of a cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry called the " reward system . "
animal studies and other evidence suggest great vari@@ ability in vulner@@ ability to addi@@ ction .
new technologies mean that ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research can start to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological and gen@@ etic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addi@@ ction if they use drugs .
new technologies in addi@@ ction research non @@@ -@@ @ inv@@ asive techniques which may help to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's in@@ ability to stop using drugs .
this dys@@ regulation would correspon@@ d either to an increased reac@@ tivity of dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons to specific sti@@ mul@@ i linked to the pleas@@ ur@@ able and ad@@ dic@@ tive product or to a down @@@ -@@ @ regulation of dop@@ am@@ ine sign@@ al@@ ling and a dam@@ pen@@ ing of activity in the reward path@@ way .
in natural situations , dop@@ am@@ ine is released when a re@@ war@@ ding experience is new , better than expected or un@@ anticipated .
this release of dop@@ am@@ ine helps the individual to memor@@ ise signals announcing a reward .
animal studies indicate that nor@@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gic and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ er@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons are coup@@ led ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . limit the activity of each other )

bio@@ diversity loss and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem de@@ grad@@ ation directly affect climate change and under@@ mines the way we are able to use natural resources .
ultimately , the use of non @@@ -@@ @ renewable natural resources , such as fos@@ sil fuels , is at the heart of the debate about climate change .
ultimately , environmental pressures that result from , for example , climate change , bio@@ diversity loss , or the use of natural resources , are linked with people 's wel@@ l@@ being ( chapters 2 to 5 ) .
many of the links described above and in the previous chapters are direct , i@@ .@@ e@@ . changes in the state of one environmental issue can trans@@ late directly into pressures of another .

the European Environment Agency is working to improve data by ensuring there is complete coverage over time for all member countries and that data delivered are as accur@@ ate as possible .
Europe 's environment should be considered in the context of soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic agen@@ das , such as the Lisbon process and sustainable development , that also have a strong global dimension .
the main barriers to progress in environmental protection and sustainability are the complex , inter @@@ -@@ @ sec@@ toral , inter @@@ -@@ @ disciplinary and international nature of both the problems and the solutions .
the Lisbon economic agenda aims to deliver higher growth and more and be � E@@ R jobs , but progress towards its objectives is mixed .
reducing regional dis@@ par@@ ities , the main goal of the European Union 's co@@ hesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � E@@ R ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Co@@ hesion Report , February 2004 ) .
these in turn are influ@@ encing consumption PA � er@@ ns and sp@@ ati@@ al planning decisions , with transport in particular playing an increasingly pi@@ vo@@ tal role in the economy and people 's lives .
the pressures on urban ag@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ations across Europe are expected to increase further as people seek to improve their living standards by moving to where the employment opportunities are greatest .
the consumption demand PA � er@@ ns of older people tend to Sh@@ i � towards services such as social and le@@ is@@ ure activities , including tourism , with consequ@@ ent environmental imp@@ acts .
so , for example , the explosive increase in air travel , which is the fas@@ test growing source of green@@ house gas emissions , reflects in part these changes in demo@@ graphy .
semi @@@ -@@ @ natural and exten@@ sively far@@ med areas are very vulnerable to changes in land management such as the c@@ ess@@ ation of gra@@ z@@ ing and mo@@ wing , which contribute to the maintenance of high biological diversity in these areas .
the continued potential for saving energy is widely recognised .
in the energy supply sector the opportunities for improvement focus in the short term on further swit@@ ching to more efficient natural gas @@@ -@@ @ pow@@ ered production , and in the longer term on increasing use of combined heat and power and dec@@ entr@@ alising electricity generation .
in particular the domestic sector 's demand for electricity and transport are rising in line with increasing wealth and the growing number of smaller households .
end @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ pip@@ e technology has reduced air poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions from power generation , but as the possibilities are narro@@ wing for some key low@@ car@@ bon technologies , such as lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e hydro @@@ -@@ @ electric power , other options need to be explo@@ red .
the current policy tools for dealing with waste are inadequate and need to be comple@@ mented by approaches that promote s@@ mar@@ ter resource use by changing production and consumption PA � er@@ ns and through innovation .
most new areas have been created at the expense of agricultural land , but are also en@@ cro@@ aching on fo@@ rested land .

across the E@@ EA @@@ -@@ @ 31 as a whole , however , organ@@ ic far@@ ming area increased by around four fi � h@@ s between 1997 and 2000 , to 4.4 million hectares from 2.@@ 4 million .

increases may either reflect the time @@@ -@@ @ la@@ g between changes in agricultural practices and their effects on ground@@ water quality or show a need for additional measures .
Mar@@ ine areas should be protected according to the rich@@ ness of their bio@@ diversity , but this protection may conflict with other uses including shipping or fishing .
cat@@ ches of open sea fish account for almost two thirds of all cat@@ ches ; about half of these cat@@ ches are outside safe limits .
fish play an integral role within the wider mar@@ ine environment , which is experiencing pressures from shipping , pollution , coastal e@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ation and climate change .
projections show that global warming will increasingly change the composition of the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems in the O@@ ce@@ ans and cause a Sh@@ i � by warm @@@ -@@ @ water species towards higher la@@ titu@@ des .
while many countries have met the targets for recycling set under the 1994 pack@@ aging waste direc@@ tive , the amount of pack@@ aging waste is still increasing .
some of this increase is a � ri@@ but@@ able to the propor@@ tion@@ ately higher generation of pack@@ aging waste from small households , but also to the growth of the internal market and the consequently greater need to transport pack@@ aged goods .
an initial analysis ( 23 ) suggests that for some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Italy and Ireland ) the direc@@ tive has had a positive impact on the implementation of pack@@ aging waste management systems .
the so@@ und@@ ness of recycling as a strategy for s@@ mar@@ ter resource use has recently been questioned ( 25 ) , but recycling is in most cases be � E@@ R for the environment than either energy recovery or disposal .
the direc@@ tive 's targets are to be met by the end of 2008 .
despite some growth in absolute terms , renewable energy is not expected to raise its share significantly , while the contribution of nuclear power is projected to decline .
natural and der@@ ived gas
Dec@@ ou@@ pling transport demand from economic growth has been a key aim of EU transport policy for several years but has yet to show results .
fre@@ ight vol@@ u@@ mes are growing faster than the economy ( at around 3 % a year compared with 2 % , for the 15 older EU M@@ ember States ) ( 31 ) .
this largely reflects the pan @@@ -@@ @ European production and consumption PA � er@@ ns that are accompan@@ ying the expansion of the EU internal market .
air transport is growing by 6 @@@ -@@ @ 9 % per year in both the old and new EU M@@ ember States .
prices are an important factor for ste@@ ering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of us@@ er prices are relevant .
there is clear agreement that transport prices do not fully cover the external costs caused by transport activities , although consensus is lacking on the exact figure to be paid .
the most important vari@@ able element is taxation on fuel , but fuel prices have remained within the same price range for more than 20 years .
implementing full @@@ -@@ @ cost pri@@ cing could help reduce environmental imp@@ acts in the same way as regulating air poll@@ ut@@ ants has led to substantial decreas@@ es in the regulated emissions .
the reasons are complex but largely linked to soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market , which is driving the rise in fre@@ ight transport .

further improvements will take place as even stricter regulations come into force in the coming years and as older vehicles are replaced with new@@ er ones .
sul@@ ph@@ ur di@@ ox@@ ide is a different case : large reductions in road transport emissions ( 61 % ) have been off@@ set by a similar increase in emissions from international maritime transport .
further action is needed to bring down pollution , especially as limits and targets may be tigh@@ tened in response to growing evidence of health imp@@ acts at concentr@@ ations below the current values .

the emis@@ sion cuts achieved so far have been mainly due to the introduction of cataly@@ sts on new cars and to the implementation of the EU sol@@ ven@@ ts direc@@ tive , which has led to lower emissions from industrial processes .
discussions are under way within the framework of the EU C@@ le@@ an Air for Europe process ( 35 ) that may lead to present limits being re@@ considered and eventually tigh@@ tened .
the urban population for which exposure estimates can be made increased from 51 to 1@@ 03 million people over the same period .
data reli@@ ability has therefore increased substan@@ tially , but data between 1996 and 2001 make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on exposure trends for either ozone or parti@@ c@@ ulates .
the reduction in emissions is mainly due to the introduction of cataly@@ sts on new cars ( cu � ing emissions of nit@@ ro@@ gen ox@@ ides ) and the implementation of the EU sol@@ ven@@ ts direc@@ tive ( limiting emissions of non @@@ -@@ @ me@@ than@@ e vola@@ tile organ@@ ic compo@@ unds from industrial processes ) .

the average temper@@ ature in Europe has increased by 0.@@ 95 ° C over the past 100 years and is projected to rise by as much as a further 6.@@ 3 ° C by 2@@ 100 .
other imp@@ acts include an increase of about ten days in the average growing season in Europe over the past 20 years .
however , projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counter@@ acted by an increased risk of water shortage , which would harm veget@@ ation .

a recent study confirms previous estimates that to m@@ iti@@ gate climate change in the longer term much larger global emis@@ sion reductions would be needed ( 37 ) .
for example , the United Kingdom and Germany have reduction targets of 60 % and 30 % ( from 1990 levels ) , to be met by 20@@ 50 and 20@@ 30 respectively .

expendi@@ ture figures per hectar@@ e could therefore not be used here , and for this reason Greece was excluded from the calc@@ ulations .
in support of this process , the European Environment Agency has prepared a series of assessments of the environment for the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region to provide policy @@@ -@@ @ relevant , up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date and reliable information on the inter@@ actions between the environment and society .
the report has been prepared in close partnership with a range of international organisations , governmental institutions and non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations across the region .

the aim of the E@@ EA is to ensure that decision @@@ -@@ @ makers and the general public are kept informed about the state and outlook of the environment .
it also illu@@ strated that for successful implementation of environmental policies we need to engage at a global and regional level with all actors .
over the last few years environment policy questions have again moved up the political agenda , which is lasting proof of the E@@ EA 's work , and that its contribution is now more relevant than ever .
in addition , and looking to the next five years , I would like to highlight some of the E@@ EA 's strategic issues .
the 5 @@@ -@@ @ year State of Environment reports and the pan @@@ -@@ @ European assessments produced by the Agency have helped shape the priorities of the research framework programmes .
it also has a key role to play in ensuring the appropriate connection between discussions taking place in scientific and political aren@@ as .

new ways of identi@@ fying emerging environmental problems
through our newly form@@ at@@ ted publication S@@ ign@@ als , we will bring to the attention of our readers those issues that we consider likely to we@@ igh heavily on the agenda for the coming year .
our work is based on the precautionary principle , evaluation of the burden of evidence , decision @@@ -@@ @ making under var@@ ying degrees of uncertainty and the use of decision @@@ -@@ @ support models and scenarios .
at the E@@ EA , we will be building the equivalent of official statistics for ecological services and environmental assets ; to set alongside the traditional assets of our economy .
in the future we will be able to demonstrate how companies and governments can em@@ bed ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services to restructure the global economy .
as more and more people become convinced about the importance of the environment in their lives , the demand for reliable local information has grown explos@@ iv@@ ely .
providing information through the E@@ EA 's networks has been a unique and positive experience .
the E@@ EA has been extending and building its networks and sources for obser@@ ving and knowledge @@@ -@@ @ gathering through its global citizen environment observatory .
today , the majority of Europeans agree that the environment has a significant impact on their quality of life and that global trends play a significant part in this .
at the same time , citizens remain concerned about climate change , the quality of air they bre@@ a@@ the , how to deal with waste and the imp@@ acts of chem@@ ic@@ als .
they have many questions about what is happening to the environment and how it will affect them and future generations .

finding , reading and understanding the range of " signals " regarding the health and diversity of our environment is at the heart of what we do .
initiatives like S@@ tern have helped people to understand what is at stake if we continue our current consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns .

the world 's economy , in terms of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , has grown at an unprecedented rate : in 19@@ 50 GDP was EU@@ R 4 tril@@ lion .
this ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
in contrast to this economic growth , our environment has suffered .

data from around Europe on emissions of so @@@ -@@ @ called green@@ house gas@@ es are collected , ver@@ ified and then analy@@ sed in two key reports that fe@@ ed into the K@@ yo@@ to process .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Co@@ p 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es .
the invent@@ ory report - counting gas@@ es
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
they must achieve this target during the period 2008 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 ( 2 ) .@@ Countries are expected to meet their K@@ yo@@ to targets mainly by cutting emissions at home .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to K@@ yo@@ to on time ) . ' K@@ yo@@ to ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
immediately after the hand @@@ -@@ @ over of the ' invent@@ ory ' report , the E@@ EA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culmin@@ ating in the ' Tren@@ ds and projections ' report .
the first E@@ EA green@@ house gas report comes out each spring and is called the ' invent@@ ory ' report .
green@@ house gas@@ es in this context refer to a collection of the most serious climate changing gas@@ es including : car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide , me@@ than@@ e , nit@@ ro@@ us ox@@ ide as well as f@@ lu@@ or@@ inated gas@@ es .
consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total green@@ house gas@@ es emissions in the EU .
different gas@@ es have different ' base years ' under K@@ yo@@ to . for car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide , me@@ than@@ e and nit@@ ro@@ us ox@@ ide ( 99 % of all emissions ) 1990 is used as the ' base year ' for all EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States .
within this , each EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember State has a differ@@ enti@@ ated reduction target : some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase .

the buz@@ z words , ' common but differ@@ enti@@ ated responsibility ' , first ut@@ tered at the Earth Summit in R@@ io , have pop@@ ped up ever since in climate change circles .
in simple language the ph@@ r@@ ase reflects the fact that developed nations have a greater responsibility for the green@@ house gas@@ es in our atmosphere .
next December , a major task of the Co@@ p 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .

Ex@@ tre@@ mes of heat and drought , rain and flooding are affecting many parts of Europe .
however , even if emissions stop today , climate change will continue for a long time due to the historical build up of green@@ house gas@@ es in the atmosphere .

the C@@ AP currently has two ' pil@@ lars ' : production and there is a stronger focus on rural development and environmental objectives .
in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the E@@ EA is also preparing an analysis of the C@@ AP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsi@@ dy 's ' environmental ' spending .
• P@@ il@@ lar II recognises the central role of far@@ ming as a supplier of food and goods , as the cor@@ ner@@ stone of rural societies and as a potential environmental manager .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , far@@ ming causes almost half of the nit@@ ro@@ gen pollution in rivers , 94 % of am@@ mon@@ ia emissions and 9 % of total green@@ house gas emissions .
many of our rar@@ est species are actually dependent on the continuation of traditional far@@ ming practices .
high nature value ( H@@ N@@ V ) far@@ m@@ land is land that is particularly rich in ha@@ bit@@ ats and species of conserv@@ ation concern .
most farmers have intensified production or abandoned far@@ ming altogether - trends that threaten natural habi@@ tat@@ s.@@ A@@ n important agriculture policy challenge is to provide economic incentives to farmers for a continuation of w@@ ild@@ life friendly far@@ ming practices .
the Com@@ mon Agriculture Policy ( C@@ AP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @@@ -@@ @ war food shortages .
the subsi@@ dy has increasingly been dec@@ ou@@ pled from its original goal of increasing food
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the E@@ EA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
however , spending on AG@@ RI @@@ -@@ @ environment sch@@ e@@ mes - the element most related to conserv@@ ation - is not strongly connected to the amount of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land in the areas studied ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .
conclusions from this example could be applied to the entire C@@ AP budget in terms of its environmental improvement efforts : the C@@ AP is having an effect but it 's not effective enough .

the Bal@@ tic was actually a fres@@ h@@ water lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
sal@@ in@@ ity in the Bal@@ tic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Bal@@ tic Sea .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
it has been estimated that an additional 30 % is lan@@ ded illegally in this part of the Bal@@ tic Sea .
in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Bal@@ tic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Bal@@ tic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integr@@ ating agricultural , fisher@@ ies and regional policies . this plan , adopted in

so@@ ils and plants are damage our soil and water resources .
kno@@ ck @@@ -@@ @ on effects , so @@@ -@@ @ called ' indirect land @@@ -@@ @ use changes ' , would impact elsewhere in the world : as Europe cuts back on food exports , other areas of the world would increase food production to fill the gap .
however , risks within Europe could be les@@ sen@@ ed with the right choice of crops and management .
in this context , the E@@ EA has been looking at how the im@@ pending bio@@ energy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .
the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
at the moment , rene@@ w@@ ables account for 6.@@ 7 % of European energy consumption .
two thirds of this comes from bi@@ om@@ ass@@ .@@ The European Commission is also keen to promote bi@@ of@@ u@@ els - fuel for transport - as diversi@@ fication is particularly important in transport because of its dependence on oil .
the transport sector is also increasing green@@ house gas emissions and e@@ ating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that bi@@ of@@ u@@ els make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certi@@ fied as sustainable .
the European Parliament has recently called for a guarantee that 40 % of the 10 % target will come from sources that do not compete with food production .
promoting bi@@ of@@ u@@ els and other bio@@ energy in Europe inev@@ it@@ ably tri@@ ggers direct and indirect effects elsewhere .
to avoid the negative imp@@ acts of a switch to bio@@ energy described above , we need strong policies at international level to prevent land @@@ -@@ @ use changes adding to environmental problems in the pursu@@ it of bio@@ energy .
in this way the EU can take the lead in building a truly sustainable bio@@ energy sector .
this process har@@ nesses the heat that is a by @@@ -@@ @ product of energy production .
however , a clear message still emer@@ ges from the exercise : it would be better , in terms of costs and climate m@@ iti@@ gation , to pri@@ or@@ iti@@ se bio@@ energy for electricity and heat generation using CHP plants rather than focus on fuel for transport .
the factors driving the export and import of waste v@@ ary : avail@@ ability of special treatment technology ; a shortage of materials ; differences in prices for disposal or recovery .
as long as this waste is not for disposal at its destination and does not contain haz@@ ard@@ ous materials , it is deemed to be an acceptable trade .
however , the export of a TV that still works is perf@@ ec@@ tly acceptable .
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the ship@@ ment of haz@@ ard@@ ous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment@@ .@@ Electronic waste , which is considered haz@@ ard@@ ous , is an important case .
waste of all descri@@ p@@ tions is on the move .
the ban contained in this Convention has not been signed by enough countries to bring it into force g@@ lob@@ ally .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Co@@ operation and Development ( OECD ) .@@ The EU 's long term aim is that each M@@ ember State should dis@@ pose of its own waste dome@@ sti@@ cally ( the ' pro@@ xim@@ ity principle ' ) .
driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .
using European trade statistics it is possible to identify the amounts , size and value of exports of used electronic and electrical products shi@@ pped from the EU to other regions ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) .
for over a decade , the cost of raw materials has been very high and this , in turn , has increased the value of secondary raw materials rec@@ la@@ imed through recycling .
the amount of plastic pack@@ aging recy@@ c@@ led has increased from about 10 to 14 million tonnes in the same period .
in general , recycling therefore contributes substan@@ tially to the reduction of energy @@@ -@@ @ related emissions of cost and

the data do not facilitate an analysis of whether the shi@@ pped waste receives better treatment at its destination , so we don '@@ t know whether it is bad for the environment .
in 2005 20 % of the waste shi@@ pped was for disposal while 80 % was shi@@ pped for recovery operations .
the simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be rep@@ lic@@ ated on a much gr@@ ander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and em@@ power the public environment@@ ally .
two new EU initiatives , in which the E@@ EA is playing a leading role and which will be further developed throughout 2009 , are at the heart of this drive .
they are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( G@@ M@@ ES ) and the Shar@@ ed Environmental Information System ( SE@@ IS ) .@@ G@@ M@@ ES will use satel@@ li@@ tes and sen@@ sors on the ground , flo@@ ating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment .
