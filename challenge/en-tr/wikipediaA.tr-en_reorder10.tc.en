to add another electron to a given volume requires raising an electron 's energy level to make room , and this requirement for energy to compress the material manifests as a pressure .
when the pressure due to this " Heisenberg motion " exceeds that of the pressure from the thermal motions of the electrons , the electrons are referred to as degenerate , and the material is termed degenerate matter .

for example , the Laurent series consisting only of the constant term 1 is identified with the real number 1 , and the series with only the linear term " x " is thought of as the simplest infinitesimal , from which the other infinitesimals are constructed .
since a Taylor series evaluated with a Laurent series as its argument is still a Laurent series , the system can be used to do calculus on transcendental functions if they are analytic .

in order to catch up to the first car , it will take a time of , that is , 25 seconds , as before .
the measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer 's frame of reference ( you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three , when in fact it arrived at three ) .
in his frame of reference , Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin , the road as the x @-@ axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y @-@ axis .
Betsy , in choosing her frame of reference , defines her location as the origin , the direction to her right as the positive " x " -axis , and the direction in front of her as the positive " y " -axis .
if Betsy 's velocity " V " is constant , she is in an inertial frame of reference , and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference , " a " in the negative " y " -direction .
frames of reference are especially important in special relativity , because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light , then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame .
that is , there exists a " universal " time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity .
seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force ( either in centrifugal direction , or in a direction orthogonal to an object 's motion , the Coriolis effect ) .
