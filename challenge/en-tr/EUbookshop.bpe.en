European agencies working across Europe for you
some six@@ teen specialised and decentral@@ ised EU agencies have been established to support the EU M@@ ember States and their citizens .
the objectives of the individual agencies are many and vari@@ ed@@ .@@ E@@ ach agency is unique and fulfil@@ s an individual function .
however , there are a number of general aims under@@ lying an agency 's operation as a whole :

European Foundation for the Im@@ prov@@ ement of Li@@ ving and Wor@@ king Con@@ di@@ tions
: " the Foundation is a European Union body set up in 19@@ 75 to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions in Europe .
it provides fi n@@ dings , knowledge and advice from independent and compar@@ ative research , to governments , employers , trade unions and the European Commission .

Foundation research reports can be down@@ loaded free of charge directly from the website or ordered online at www.@@ euro@@ found@@ .@@ eu@@ .@@ in@@ t@@ .
the Foundation has a tripartite Administ@@ r@@ ative Board , made up of representatives from public authorities ( governments and the European Commission ) , emplo@@ yer organisations and trade unions .
: " the European Environment Agency ( E@@ EA ) is the EU body dedicated to providing sound and independent information on the environment .
we are a main information source for those involved in developing , adopting , implementing and evalu@@ ating environmental policy , as well as the general public .
our aim is to help the EU and member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment , integr@@ ating environmental consider@@ ations into economic policies and moving towards sustainability
information for improving Europe 's environment
the E@@ EA and E@@ ion@@ et were established by Council Regula@@ tion ( E@@ EC ) No 12@@ 10 / 90 of 7 May 1990 with later amendments ( 199@@ 9,@@ 2003 ) .
the Agency is located in Copenhagen and by 2004 had a staff of approximately 115 .
the Agency 's 2004 budget is about EU@@ R 31 million .
membership is open to countries that are not M@@ ember States of the European Union .
we now ( 2004 ) have 31 member countries : 25 EU M@@ ember States together with Bulgaria , Iceland , Li@@ ech@@ ten@@ stein , Norway , Romania and Turkey .
European Tra@@ ining Foundation
as an international centre of expertise , the E@@ T@@ F collabor@@ ates with other European and international institutions and organisations such as the World Bank , OECD , the I@@ L@@ O , the European Investment Bank and UNESCO .
: " the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) is the hub of drug @@@ -@@ @ related information in the European Union .
among the Centre 's target groups are policy @@@ -@@ @ makers , who use this information to help formu@@ late co@@ her@@ ent national and Community drug strategies .
also served are professionals and researchers working in the drugs field and , more broad@@ ly , the European media and general public .
at the heart of the Centre 's work is the task of improving the compar@@ ability of drug information across Europe and dev@@ ising the methods and tools required to achieve this .
as a result of efforts to date , countries can now view how they fit into the wider European picture and examine common problems and goals .
a key feature of the drug phenomenon is its shif@@ ting , dynamic nature , and tr@@ acking new developments is a central task of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
meanwhile online Country situation sum@@ mar@@ ies provide a rich pool of national drug @@@ -@@ @ related data .
E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , your reference point on drugs in Europe
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA works on the ass@@ umption that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs .
although the Centre can@@ not propose any kind of policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @@@ -@@ @ making through its analy@@ ses , instruments and standards .
: " the European Medi@@ cin@@ es Agency ( E@@ M@@ EA ) contributes to the protection of public and animal health by ensuring that medicin@@ es for human and veterinary use are safe , effective and of high quality .
it co@@ operates closely with international partners , rein@@ forcing the EU contribution to global harmonisation .
the E@@ M@@ EA began its activities in 1995 , when the European system for author@@ ising medicin@@ al products was introduced providing for a central@@ ised and a mutual recognition procedure .
the E@@ M@@ EA has a role in both , but is primarily involved in the central@@ ised procedure .
from the end of 2004 on@@ wards a new Committee on her@@ bal medicin@@ al Pro@@ duc@@ ts ( H@@ MP@@ C ) will provide scientific opinions on traditional her@@ bal medicin@@ es .
the scientific work of the E@@ M@@ EA and its committees is under@@ pin@@ ned by a network of 3 500 European experts .
ten years after its inauguration , the E@@ M@@ EA is implementing new legislation that will significantly bro@@ a@@ den the mandate of the Agency .
office for harmon@@ ization in the Internal Market ( Trade Mar@@ ks and design@@ s )
the Community trade mark and the Community registered design are the g@@ ate@@ way to a single market .
their un@@ itary nature means that form@@ alities and management can be kept simple : a single application , a single administrative centre and a single file to be managed .
a uni@@ form law applies to trade marks and design@@ s , there@@ by providing strong and unique protection throughout the European Union .
the simplif@@ ic@@ ation results in considerably reduced costs as compared with the overall costs of national registration in all countries of the European Union .
when ideas take shape , it 's time to protect them

pre@@ face he competition policy pursu@@ ed by the European Commission has a direct impact on th@@ ed@@ a@@ ily life of the citizens of the European Union .
T wider access to air transport and the possibility of buying a car in the EU country in which pri@@ ces@@ are lowest are tangible results .
other , less visible , areas of Community competition policy al@@ sop@@ ro@@ du@@ ce positive effects for the public .
for example , mer@@ ger control ensu@@ res a diversity of mass @@@ -@@ @ market consumer goods and low prices for the final consumer .
likewise , by contributing to economic and social co@@ hesion , the monitoring of State aid helps to promote viable and@@ dur@@ able jobs throughout the Union .
whether they be consumers , sa@@ vers , users of public services , employees or taxpayers , the Union 's citizens enjoy the fru@@ its of the competition policy in the@@ various aspects of their everyday life .
Re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing@@ firms to compete with each other fos@@ ters innovation , redu@@ ces production costs , increas@@ es@@ economic efficiency and , consequently , enhan@@ ces the competitiveness of the European economy , particularly vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis its main trading partners .
firms stimu@@ lated by competition thus offer produc@@ ts@@ and services which are competitive in terms of price and quality .
the propag@@ ation of th@@ ec@@ om@@ peti@@ tive process thus helps to consolidate the industrial fabri@@ c of the internal market and , in so doing , provides clear back @@@ -@@ @ up to employment policies .
secondly , greater competition allows the consumer to choose from a wider range of produc@@ ts@@ and services at lower prices .
thus , the same policy of liberalisation has had concrete effects for@@ users in terms of lower prices and access to new services .
a recent study has shown that some@@ telephone charges have fallen by 35 % .
the European Commission has exclusive power to monitor the State aid granted by the M@@ ember States " public authorities .
aid is in principle prohibited by the Treaty if , by favour@@ ing certain firms , it is li@@ able to cause damage to their competitors in other M@@ ember States , which in some cas@@ es@@ might go as far as to jeopardise their very survival and , consequently , the jobs of their
only if aid is justified by the existence of a Community interest will the Com@@ mission@@ grant exem@@ ption from this general principle of prohibi@@ tion .
in some cases , State aid mer@@ ely leads to activities which no longer meet the requirements of economic efficiency being maintained arti@@ fic@@ ially , or to competition with efficient firms in the same sector being dist@@ or@@ ted .
public aid sometimes has a pu@@ rely pla@@ ce@@ bo effect on firms in difficulty .
for example , 30 % of assisted firms in the former German Democratic Repub@@ lic@@ had closed down within two years of receiving aid .
I have asked for the establishment of an aid register list@@ ing@@ all of the Commission 's decisions concerning State aid , and of a sco@@ re@@ board which would enab@@ le@@ it to be seen whether M@@ ember States are comp@@ lying with the State aid rules .
we must al@@ so@@ improve the economic analysis of aid granted in order better to evaluate its cost and impact on@@ the internal market .
I am convinced that transparency will enable the public and it@@ s@@ representatives to become more involved in aid @@@ -@@ @ monitoring policy .
it enhan@@ ces the quality and variety of good@@ sp@@ la@@ ced on the market , fos@@ ters technological innovation and economic performance and , finally , promotes fair prices for users .
however , the Commission 's competition policy is not limited to protecting consumers from th@@ ed@@ an@@ gers that face them .
it also seeks to preserve and stimulate their ability to operate on them@@ ar@@ ket in such a way as to contribute to the competitive process .
in conclusion , the Commission and its departments responsible for competition encourage the@@ active participation of consumers and their organisations .
given their knowledge of the day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day functioning of markets , in particular those in mass @@@ -@@ @ market consumer goods , consum@@ er@@ organisations are able to provide the Commission with information of interest to the Community by raising complaints or through informal contact .
such information may enable the Commission to initiate investigation proceedings concerning practices which dist@@ ort competition .
this bro@@ ch@@ ure has the dual objective of in@@ forming the public of the real benefits it can expec@@ t@@ from European competition policy and ar@@ ous@@ ing its interest and can@@ v@@ ass@@ ing its help in@@ implementing that policy .
I hope that the European public will respond favour@@ ably to this request .
I am convinced that a rigor@@ ous application of competition policy is the best way of guarante@@ e@@ ing@@ economic freedom .
economic freedom , within a proper regulatory framework , is a precondition for the development of a free society .
freedom of competition is thus a public@@ freedom .
it imp@@ acts not only on the economic environment but also on the organisation of@@ society at large .
it is in this way that competition policy is a " people 's " policy .
a brief out@@ line
member States are to adopt an economic policy " conducted in accor@@ dan@@ ce@@ with the principle of an open market economy with free competition . "
the Community 's competition policy pursu@@ es a precise goal , which is to defend@@ and develop effective competi@@ tion@@ in the common market .
competition is ab@@ as@@ ic mechanism of the market econom@@ y@@ involving supply ( producers , tr@@ aders ) and demand ( inter@@ mediate customers , consumers ) . suppliers offer goods or@@ services on the market in an en@@ deavour to meet demand .
demand seeks the@@ best rati@@ o between quality and pri@@ ce@@ for the products it requires . the mos@@ te@@ fficient response emer@@ ges as a result of a contest between suppliers .
thus , competition leads everybody individually to seek out the means of striking th@@ is@@ balance between quality and price in order to meet demand to the best possible
the Community '@@ s@@ competition policy@@ pursu@@ es a precise goal , which is to defend and@@ develop effec@@ tiv@@ ec@@ om@@ petition in th@@ ec@@ om@@ mon market .
extent . competition is therefore a simple and effici@@ ent@@ means of guarante@@ eing consumers a level of exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce@@ in terms of the quality and price of products and@@ services .
it also forces firms to strive for competi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess@@ and economic efficiency .
this consol@@ i@@ dates the Community 's industrial and commercial fabri@@ c so that itis able to conf@@ ront the competitiveness of our main@@ partners and to put Community firms in a position tos@@ uc@@ ce@@ ed in markets around the world .
European competition policy is based on a Community legislative fra@@ me@@ work@@ essentially provided by the EC Treaty ( articles 81 to 90 ) .
further rules are@@ provided by a Council regulation known as the mer@@ ger regulation .
on the bas@@ is@@ of this body of law , competition policy focuses on four main areas of action .
• The elimination of agreements which restric@@ t competition and of abuses of ad@@ omin@@ ant position ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . price @@@ -@@ @ fixing agreements between competitors ) .
• The control of mer@@ gers between firms ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . a mer@@ ger between two large group@@ s@@ which results in their domin@@ ating the market ) .
• The liberalisation of monopol@@ istic economic sectors ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . telecommunications ) .
• The monitoring of State aid ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . the prohibi@@ tion of a State grant designed to keep@@ a loss @@@ -@@ @ making firm in business even though it has no prospect of recovery ) .
community law stri@@ ves to defend the common market and stimulate competi@@ tion@@ within what is a vast economic area .
it does not enter into play until such time@@ as trade between M@@ ember States is aff@@ ec@@ ted@@ by the practices in question .
Fo@@ re@@ x@@ amp@@ le , a price @@@ -@@ @ fixing agreement between Bak@@ ers in a given town will not ha@@ ve@@ any impact on the Community market , and European law is therefore not@@ applic@@ able to this kind of situation .
however , such an agreement would prob@@ ab@@ ly@@ be covered by domestic law .
the condition that trade be affected is central to all Community provisions .
the European Com@@ mission@@ has the power to deal with these matters .
in some cases , this power is shared with the M@@ ember States " own competi@@ tion@@ authorities and law courts ( articles 81 and 82 ) , while in others it li@@ es@@ exclu@@ si@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ with the Commission ( mer@@ ger control , monitoring of State aid ) .
it is shared when a rule is generally applic@@ able throughout the Community .
both the Commission and the courts in the M@@ ember States have a duty to@@ enforce such rules .
by contrast , it is exclusive when the legislative provision in@@ question expres@@ s@@ ly stipulates that this is the case .
for the control of large @@@ -@@ @ scal@@ emer@@ gers , the M@@ ember States considered it necessary to create a one @@@ -@@ @ stop shop@@ .@@ They appointed the European Commission to that end .
for State aid , the@@ decision whether or not aid granted by M@@ ember States is illegal can be tak@@ en@@ only by a sup@@ ran@@ ational and independent authority .
finally , it should be added that most M@@ ember States have their own dome@@ sti@@ cla@@ w@@ s@@ to counter anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practices ( restric@@ tive agreements , abuses of ad@@ omin@@ ant position , and mer@@ gers ) .
national law makes it possible to take ac@@ tion@@ against practices which do not have any impact on trade between M@@ ember States .
a rigor@@ ous procedure is laid down in various implementing regulations .
The@@ y@@ conf@@ er powers of investig@@ ation@@ on the Commission 's agents .
due proc@@ ess@@ is@@ guaranteed , as is commercial confi@@ denti@@ ality .
Commission policy would be in@@ effective if its monitoring and control activ@@ iti@@ es@@ were not accompanied by decis@@ ion@@ s@@ and penalties .
in the area of its anti @@@ -@@ @ tru@@ st@@ operations , the Commission has the power not only to prohibi@@ tan agreement or@@ to issue an in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion@@ that a restric@@ tive practice be stopped , but also to im@@ pos@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ on firms found guilty of anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive conduct .
the amount of th@@ es@@ e@@ fin@@ es@@ is calculated according to the gra@@ vity and dur@@ ation of the inf@@ r@@ ing@@ em@@ ent@@ .@@ Some of the most serious practices are price car@@ tels or ab@@ u@@ sive conduct by fir@@ m@@ sh@@ ol@@ ding a virtual monopoly .
an appeal against a Commission decision may be lo@@ d@@ ged with the Court of First In@@ stance or the Court of Justice of the European Commun@@ ities .
Res@@ tri@@ c@@ tiv@@ e@@ agreements an@@ da@@ b@@ use of a dominant position
restric@@ tive agreements
some agreements between enterprises imp@@ air competition .
the most famili@@ ar@@ example is an agreement on prices , or car@@ tel , where@@ by firms fix price lev@@ el@@ s@@ jointly so that consumers are unable to take advantage of competition bet@@ we@@ en@@ suppliers to obtain competitive prices .
the result for the final consumer is an@@ increase in market prices .
other agreements have the object or effect of fi@@ x@@ in@@ go@@ ther conditions for the operation of markets : for example , they may al@@ loc@@ ate@@ production quotas to firms or share markets between them .
agreements of th@@ ist@@ y@@ pe are prohibited in the European Community because they dist@@ ort@@ competition and are de@@ tri@@ mental to the various operators on the market .
forms of distribution . in those circumstances , enterprises no longer have to be real@@ ly@@ competitive and have no incentive to innov@@ ate or reduce production costs .
the crisis thus affects employees , sub@@ contractors and tr@@ ad@@ er@@ s.@@ Mo@@ reover , arti@@ fic@@ ially high prices affect the costs of inter@@ mediate consumers , who are adver@@ sely affected by their suppliers " anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive behaviour .
the dynam@@ ism of those enterprises is therefore dam@@ pen@@ ed .
l@@ ast@@ ly , final@@ consumers pay more for products or services , have a restricted choice and don@@ ot benefit from technical or economic progress .
the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive behaviour of a few firms thus har@@ ms all operators and@@ justi@@ fies the intervention of the authorities .
in each of the last three years , the European Commission has dealt on average with over 400 cases concer@@ n@@ ing@@ agreements restric@@ ting competition .
community law ( Article 81 )
agreements restric@@ ting competition are prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty .
if an agreement fulfil@@ s the following conditions , it is vo@@ id : it is concluded between firms or " under@@ tak@@ ings " ;
• • it leads to an appreci@@ able re@@ stri@@ ction of competition on the market .
it may fi@@ x@@ purchase or selling prices or other trading conditions ; it may limit production , markets , technical development or investment .
it may also share markets or@@ sources of supply between competitors .
l@@ ast@@ ly , it may apply discrimin@@ atory conditions to firms that are not parties to the agreement , placing them at ac@@ om@@ peti@@ tive dis@@ advantage .
an agreement is considered to restric@@ t competition if it@@ inter@@ fer@@ es appreci@@ ably with the normal inter@@ play of supply and demand .
however , some agreements may encourage competition , because they promote technical progress or improve distribution , for example .
under Community law , those agreements can be exemp@@ ted from the prohibi@@ tion because they ultimately have a beneficial effect on the market .
four tests must be satisfied if an agreement is to qualify for an exem@@ ption :
• it must improve the production or distribution of goods or promote economic
article progress ; it must allow inter@@ mediate or final consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit ;
• • the re@@ stri@@ ction of competition must be in@@ dis@@ pen@@ sa@@ ble to the at@@ tain@@ ment of the fir@@ st@@ two conditions ;
• it must not eliminate competition in respect of a substantial pro@@ portion of the@@ products or services in question .
some examples of ac@@ tion@@ taken by the Commission
in October 1998 , the Commission termin@@ ated a car@@ tel between producers of distance @@@ -@@ @ heating pip@@ es , which had jointly fixed prices and terms for tenders to public authorities .
the car@@ tel was set up in Denmark at the end of 1990 and subsequently extended to Germany and other EU M@@ ember States .
from 1994 , the entire European market was covered .
V of the car@@ tel shared national markets and jointly fixed prices for distance @@@ -@@ @ heating
under Community law , an individual agreement between firms can be exemp@@ ted , and so can categories of agreements of the same nature , such as distribu@@ tion@@ agreements for example .
at present only the European Commission can exercise the power to exem@@ pt ar@@ es@@ tri@@ c@@ tive agreement under Article 81 .
to obtain an individual exem@@ ption , fir@@ m@@ s@@ must noti@@ fy their agreements to the European Commission .
in recent years , the Commission has received on average over 200 such noti@@ fic@@ ations annually .
in 1999 , it suggested termin@@ ating this central@@ ised noti@@ fication of all agre@@ em@@ ent@@ s@@ between enterprises .
many agreements that are noti@@ fied do not involve ser@@ i@@ ous@@ problems for competition .
these restric@@ tive agreements are automatically vo@@ id , and the Commission has@@ power to prohibi@@ t them and impose fines on the off@@ ending firms .
in certain conditions , it may also exem@@ pt some agreements that restric@@ t competition .
in addition , it enjoys investig@@ atory powers enti@@ tling it to inspect firms " premises in@@ search of evidence of secret agreements .
the Commission imposed fines totalling approximately EU@@ R@@ 92 million on the members of the car@@ tel .
in this case , the anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practice har@@ med firms outside the car@@ tel , which were system@@ atically exclu@@ de@@ d@@ from calls for tenders , as well as local authorities and hence taxpayers .
car@@ tel prohibited in the sugar sector
two sugar producers and two sugar tr@@ aders in the United Kingdom adopted acon@@ cer@@ ted strategy for increasing prices on the sugar market .
the result of th@@ is@@ agreement , for the final consumer , was purchase prices that were higher than@@ they would have been with free competition .
in 1998 , the Commission there@@ fore@@ prohibited the agreement and imposed fines totalling more than EU@@ R 50 milli@@ on@@ on the firms .
open will offer new digital inter@@ active television services in@@ the United Kingdom .
after the new venture has been set up , businesses such as@@ banks , super@@ markets or travel agencies will be able to offer British consumers inter@@ active services via television . access to the services will be through a de@@ co@@ der .
before the Commission authorised the agreement , it satisfied itself that competition would continue after Open was set up .
for example , commitments given by Open 's shareholders will provide access to the market for@@ third parties .
third parties will have access to Open de@@ co@@ ders and to B@@ Sk@@ y@@ B 's cinema and sport channels .
l@@ ast@@ ly , de@@ co@@ ders in competition with Open de@@ co@@ ders@@ can be sold on the market without hin@@ dr@@ ance .
in this case , the Com@@ mission@@ sought to make it easier for new digital inter@@ active television services to develop@@ while at the same time ensuring that there was competition on the market .
the benefit to British consumers is therefore t@@ wo@@ fold .
abuse of ad@@ omin@@ ant position
efficient businesses are run with a view to conqu@@ ering markets , to the poin@@ t@@ where they may establish very strong positions indeed .
holding a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position is not wrong in itself .
it is the result of the firm 's own effectiveness .
but if the firm explo@@ its its power to sti@@ f@@ le competition , this is an anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive practice which constitu@@ tes abuse .
it is therefore the abuse of the dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position that is wrong .
those practices inter@@ fere with@@ competition .
the Commission can act against them and punish their perpetr@@ ator@@ s@@ severely .
citizens have good reason to be appre@@ hensive of abuses of this kind , wh@@ ich@@ result in higher prices , restrictions on the avail@@ ability of products and services and unfair trading conditions .
community law
article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibi@@ ts the abuse of a dominant position . for the article to apply , the following conditions must be fulfilled .
• The firm holds a dominant position .
• The firm domin@@ ates the common market or a " substantial part " of the common market .
there is no exem@@ ption available for abuse of a dominant position .
the Commission can adopt a decision prohibi@@ ting an abuse and fin@@ ing the@@ off@@ ending firm .
in 1998 and 1999 , the Commission adopted around a doz@@ en@@ decisions prohibi@@ ting abuses .
some examples of action taken by the Commission
abuse of a dominant position on the ice @@@ -@@ @ cre@@ am distribution market
as a result of a complaint submitted by Mar@@ s , the Commission found that Un@@ il@@ ever had abused its dominant position .
Un@@ il@@ ever provided freez@@ er cab@@ in@@ ets to@@ its Irish distribut@@ ors free of any direct charge on condition that they sto@@ cked only Un@@ il@@ ever products there .
Irish consumers therefore had a very restricted choice of@@ ice @@@ -@@ @ cre@@ ams .
the Commission considered that having regard to Un@@ il@@ ever '@@ s@@ dominant position on the market the requirement of exclusive use constitu@@ te@@ dan abuse .
abuse of a dominant position on the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies
acting on a complaint by Vir@@ gin Airways , the Commission found in July 199@@ 9@@ that British Airways had abused a dominant position .
the abuse cons@@ isted of@@ establishing a system of brand lo@@ yal@@ ty , which meant that the market in air@@ transport services provided by travel agencies was closed to British Airways '@@ competitors .
British Airways offered some British travel agencies extr@@ ac@@ om@@ mission if they equ@@ alled or exceeded their previous year 's sales of British Airways " tickets .
the effect of the system was to@@ reinforce agencies " brand lo@@ yal@@ ty to British Air@@ w@@ ay@@ s@@ and to dis@@ courage them from offering the services of
/ other air@@ lines .
British Airways held a dominant position , so that the system@@ formed a real barrier to competing air@@ lines " access to the market .
since the@@ agencies favoured the airline paying the highest commission , consumers w@@ er@@ e@@ almost always offered British Airways " tickets even if competitors " services w@@ er@@ em@@ ore advant@@ age@@ ous .
the Commission therefore considered that this practice , which affected the market in air transport services offered by travel agencies , constitu@@ ted an abuse of a dominant position .
abuse of a dominant position in the organisation of the Football World Cup
on 20 July 1999 , the Commission adopted a formal decision against the Fren@@ ch@@ committee organising the Football World Cup which was held in France in 199@@ 8.@@ The committee , the C@@ F@@ O , held a monopoly in the organisation of the event th@@ at@@ included ticket sales .
the Commission found that the arrangements for tic@@ ket@@ sales for the final matches were discrimin@@ atory and constitu@@ ted an abuse of ad@@ omin@@ ant position .
persons not resident in France who w@@ ished to see the final@@ s@@ were thus at a sever@@ ed@@ is@@ advantage compared with@@ persons resident in Fran@@ ce@@ .@@ The Commission there@@ for@@ er@@ uled against the C@@ F@@ O .
when companies comb@@ ine via a mer@@ ger , an acquisition or the creation of a join@@ t@@ venture , this generally has a positive impact on markets .
they thus become more efficient on the market .
Com@@ peti@@ tion@@ intensi@@ fies and the final consumer will benefit from higher @@@ -@@ @ quality goods at fair@@ er@@ prices .
Mer@@ gers which create or@@ strengthen a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position , however , are@@ prohibited by the Tre@@ at@@ y@@ in order to prev@@ ent@@ ensu@@ ing abuses .
Mer@@ gers which create or strengthen a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position , however , are prohibited by the Treaty in@@ order to prevent ensu@@ ing abuses . a firm is in ad@@ omin@@ ant position when it is able to act on them@@ ar@@ ket without having to take account of there@@ action of its competitors , suppliers or@@ customers .
for example , such a firm can increas@@ e@@ its prices above those of its competitors with@@ out@@ fearing any loss of profit .
all market players ande@@ spec@@ ially consumers stand to lose from the@@ emer@@ gence of this kind of dominant structure , which is likely to result in higher prices , a narro@@ wer choice of goods or scar@@ c@@ it@@ y@@ of innovation .
that is why the European Union has set up an advance vet@@ t@@ ing@@ system for mer@@ gers with a Community dimension that enables it to prohibi@@ t ap@@ lan@@ ned mer@@ ger if necessary .
i@@ den@@ tical systems have been set up in the M@@ ember States for investigating mer@@ gers of national dimension .
public opinion does not always understand why the Commission appro@@ ves@@ mer@@ gers and acquis@@ itions when they involve loss of jobs .
it must be bor@@ ne in@@ mind that the Commission 's objective in the mer@@ ger control field is to preserve as@@ itu@@ ation of effective competition on the markets , which it considers to be agu@@ aran@@ tee of growth and thus of viable jobs .
it may be that , in the short term , efforts to improve the competitiveness of firms by means of mer@@ gers or@@ acquis@@ itions involve restructuring and thus loss of jobs .
however , this does not@@ change the fact that improving firms " competitiveness is the only effective w@@ ay@@ to ensure the growth needed to create business and stable and lasting jobs .
( regulation ( E@@ EC ) No 4@@ 0@@ 64 / 89 )
the Community 's system for monitoring this type of trans@@ action has be@@ en@@ govern@@ ed by the mer@@ ger regulation since 1990 .
the regulation is based on the@@ following principles .
• The European Commission has exclusive power to investigate mer@@ gers with a
the Community dimension of a mer@@ ger or acquisition is@@ assessed using th@@ res@@ holds based on the turnover of the companies invol@@ v@@ ed@@ .@@ The most important are the worldwide threshold ( EU@@ R 5 000 million ) and the Community @@@ -@@ @ wide threshold ( EU@@ R 250 million ) .
below these th@@ res@@ holds , mer@@ ger@@ control is carried out by the authorities in the M@@ ember States under their ow@@ n@@ legislation .
• Mer@@ gers and acquis@@ itions with a Community dimension have to be noti@@ fied to the Commission for its agreement before they are put into effect .
since the@@ entry into force of the mer@@ ger regulation , the Commission has seen th@@ en@@ um@@ ber of noti@@ fic@@ ations grow very rapidly , especially in recent years , when the annual rate of growth has been around 30 % .
the Commission currently receives close on 300 noti@@ fic@@ ations every year .
• After an initial scrutiny period of one month , the Commission decides either to
regulation author@@ ise the trans@@ action or , if it thinks that a dominant position might be created or strengthened , to initiate a four @@@ -@@ @ month investigation procedure .
• At the end of this procedure , the Commission may author@@ ise the mer@@ ger
( E@@ EC ) No 4@@ 0@@ 64 / 89 condi@@ tionally or un@@ condi@@ tionally , or it may prohibi@@ t it , for example in cases where the companies have not been able to propose appropriate solutions to th@@ ec@@ on@@ cer@@ ns raised by the Commission .
" conditions " att@@ ached to the author@@ is@@ ation@@ frequently ent@@ ail the sale to competitors of assets , shares in other companies , pat@@ ents , et@@ c .
( more than 90 % ) .
in a market in the process of integration , mer@@ gers wh@@ ich@@ create or strengthen a dominant position are , in fact , quite rare .
• Most cases going through the four @@@ -@@ @ month investigation procedure are resolved by a conditional author@@ isation .
In@@ some cases , the mer@@ ger is prohibited ; not only would it create or strengthen ad@@ omin@@ ant position , but the firms have also been unable to propose a sol@@ u@@ tion@@ to the competition concerns raised by the Commission .
Mer@@ gers in the retail distribution sector
in recent years , numerous large retailers have noti@@ fied mer@@ ger plans to the European Commission .
examples are the food retailers Kes@@ ko / T@@ uk@@ o in Finland ( 1997 ) , RE@@ W@@ E / M@@ ain@@ l in Austria ( 1999 ) and Car@@ re@@ four / Pro@@ mod@@ è@@ s in France and Spain ( 2000 ) .
in both the Finnish and Austrian cases , the Com@@ mission@@ considered that the mer@@ ger of these retail cha@@ ins would have created ad@@ omin@@ ant position ; in the Finnish case , it decided to prohibi@@ t the trans@@ action , while in the Austrian case it accepted the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies , which cons@@ isted essentially of the sale of certain outlets to competitors .
the mer@@ ger of Car@@ re@@ four and Pro@@ mod@@ è@@ s was authorised subject to the@@ div@@ est@@ ment of a maj@@ or@@ sharehol@@ ding in ac@@ om@@ peti@@ tor .
but the@@ analysis of competi@@ tiv@@ ec@@ on@@ di@@ tions at lo@@ cal@@ level was left to th@@ en@@ ational competi@@ tion@@ authorities , since th@@ emer@@ ger involved as@@ eries of very lo@@ cal@@ is@@ ed@@ competition problems .
the Commission thus ensured th@@ at@@ competition was@@ preserved or restored in order to allow consumers to continue to benefit from ac@@ ho@@ ice of outlets , attractive prices and a di@@ verse range of consumer goods .
a mer@@ ger in the insurance sector
insurance policy@@ hol@@ ders and investors , especially in Italy , stand to benefit fro@@ m@@ the re@@ medi@@ es proposed by the companies in the context of INA 's acquisition by Generali ; both companies are large international insurance firms .
the initi@@ alan@@ aly@@ sis of the takeover led the Commission to form serious doubts about it@@ s@@ compati@@ bility with Community law .
it would have given the new firm siz@@ e@@ ab@@ le@@ shares of the market for the supply of various life @@@ -@@ @ assur@@ ance products in Italy .
in addition , the investigation revealed links between the two firms and the@@ ir@@ main competitors that could have indu@@ ced them to co@@ ordinate their behavi@@ our@@ in the insurance and investment fields .
effective competition was thus restored in Italy in af@@ inan@@ cial sector that primarily concerns the public .
a mer@@ ger in the pet@@ ro@@ leum products sector
French citizens and people travelling across France have everything to gain from the Commission 's action in the To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina / el@@ f A@@ qu@@ it@@ a@@ ine case .
the mer@@ ging of the@@ operations of the two main players in the French pet@@ ro@@ leum products sector wo@@ ul@@ d@@ have created a dominant position on@@ several markets . after the mer@@ ger , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina
the mer@@ ging of the@@ operations of the tw@@ om@@ ain players in the French pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um@@ products sector wo@@ ul@@ d@@ have created a dom@@ inan@@ t@@ position on sever@@ al@@ markets .
the super@@ markets have helped to reduce fuel prices in France and to keep them at fair@@ ly@@ low levels .
furthermore , the combination of To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina and el@@ f service stations on French motor@@ ways would have given the new group a market share of some 60 % .
the Commission considered that this level of market power would have pus@@ h@@ ed@@ up prices in a market where they were already high .
l@@ ast@@ ly , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina and El@@ f@@ would have become the leader on the market for L@@ P@@ G , used for heating . in or@@ der@@ to resolve the competition problems identified , To@@ tal@@ F@@ ina / el@@ f under@@ took to sell alar@@ ge pro@@ portion of the operations concerned to competitors .
for example , it@@ proposed selling 70 motor@@ way service stations in France to competitors .
in this way , the Commission ensured that the French fuel markets remain@@ ed@@ competitive and that consumers continued to benefit from the supply of@@ pet@@ ro@@ leum products at fair prices .
these special rights generally correspon@@ d@@ to responsibilities linked to the performance of the public service entr@@ usted to@@ the undertaking .
however , the special rights must not go beyond what is necessary for the performance of that service .
otherwise , from the point of view of Community law , they would cre@@ a@@ tes@@ itu@@ ations that restric@@ t competition .
the public authorities in the M@@ ember States may gr@@ ant@@ special rights , in particul@@ ar@@ monopoly rights , to public or@@ private under@@ tak@@ ings top@@ er@@ form services of general@@ economic interest .
frequently , these monopol@@ ies have been in@@ network industries - transport , energy and@@ telecommunications .
in these sectors , a distinc@@ tion must be made between the@@ infrastructure and the services provided over@@ this infrastructure .
while it is often difficult to@@ establish a second , competing infrastructure , for reasons linked to investment costs ande@@ con@@ om@@ ic efficiency , it is possible and desi@@ rab@@ le@@ to create competitive conditions in respect of@@ the services provided .
the Commission has@@ therefore developed the concept of separ@@ ating infrastructure from commercial activities .
the infrastructure is thus mer@@ ely the vehicle of competition .
this is the general@@ principle on which the Community liberalisation direc@@ tives are based .
the process of opening up these sectors to@@ competition has a positi@@ ve@@ impact for inter@@ medi@@ ate@@ users , and also for final@@ consumers .
in a sector of the economy which is experi@@ en@@ cin@@ grap@@ id growth driven by the emer@@ gence of the Internet and of electron@@ ic@@ commerce , the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is a source of@@ competitiveness and new jobs .
community law ( Article 86 )
the Commission has various means of applying the principle of opening up@@ monopoly markets .
the Commission checks that M@@ ember States , when they grant special ore@@ x@@ clu@@ sive rights , comply with the Community competition rules .
depending on the circumstances , it may itself adopt a European liberalisation direc@@ tive , or propose that such a direc@@ tive be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament .
a direc@@ tive is a piece of Community legislation which sets a common objective to be at@@ tained by all M@@ ember States , one that each M@@ ember State will incorpor@@ ate
article 86 into its own legislation and enforce .
it was in this way that the European Uni@@ on@@ initiated the opening @@@ -@@ @ up of the telecommunications , transport , pos@@ tal , gas ande@@ lec@@ tri@@ city markets .
the Commission checks that these objectives are ac@@ tu@@ al@@ ly@@ achieved .
mobile tele@@ phones in Spain
the liberalisation of mobile telephony in Europe was@@ introduced by a 1996 Community direc@@ tive opening up@@ the mobile and personal communications market to@@ competition .
EU@@ R 5@@ 10 million for the right to operate on the Spanish market , while Tele@@ f@@ ó@@ nica , the State operator , had been allowed to provide mobile telephone services without
in rest@@ oring the@@ balance between Tele@@ f@@ ó@@ nica and Air@@ tel M@@ ó@@ vil , the Com@@ mission@@ sought to stimu@@ la@@ te@@ competition in the@@ interest of mobile telephone users in Spain .
advantage over its new competi@@ tor , enabling it tos@@ tr@@ eng@@ then its dominant position on the mobil@@ e@@ telephony market .
the Commission there@@ for@@ er@@ equ@@ ired the Spanish Government to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se@@ the EU@@ R 5@@ 10 million to Air@@ tel M@@ ó@@ vil or to propos@@ e@@ equivalent correc@@ tive measures .
in April 1997 , the Commission accepted the correc@@ tiv@@ e@@ measures proposed by the Spanish Government with a view to ending the dist@@ or@@ tion of competition .
the Commission decided that there was no necessary relation bet@@ we@@ en@@ the stated cultural policy objective of preserving plur@@ alism in the F@@ le@@ mis@@ h prin@@ ted@@ press and the granting in F@@ lan@@ ders of a monopoly on commercial television to V@@ T@@ M .
these measures ultimately constitu@@ ted a form of discrimination with@@ protec@@ tion@@ ist consequences that also affected Belgian viewers from the F@@ le@@ mis@@ h Community , whose choice of television stations was restricted .
scrutiny of State aid
state aid that dist@@ orts in@@ tra @@@ -@@ @ Community competition is prohibited by the Tre@@ at@@ y@@ .@@ By giving certain firms or products favoured treatment to the de@@ tri@@ ment of other@@ firms or products , it seriously dis@@ rup@@ ts normal competitive forces .
aid given by public authorities most com@@ mon@@ ly supports a firm , an econom@@ ic@@ activity or a region in order to promote its development or alleviate its difficulties .
at first sight , particularly from the recipient '@@ san@@ gle , State aid might well seem to be beneficial .
but very often all it achiev@@ es is to delay inev@@ it@@ ab@@ ler@@ est@@ ruc@@ turing operations without helping the recipi@@ ent@@ actually to return to competitiveness .
development or diversi@@ fication programme .
Un@@ subsidis@@ ed firms can even run in@@ to@@ difficulties that will impact on their competitiveness and ability to keep the@@ i@@ re@@ mp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es in jobs .
ultimately , then , the entire market will suffer from State aid , and the general competitiveness of the European economy is im@@ per@@ il@@ led .
aid to particul@@ ar@@ ly@@ back@@ ward regions can help them catch up on their development back@@ lo@@ g and become equ@@ al@@ competitors with the other , more develop@@ ed@@ regions .
once these regions have removed the@@ ir@@ han@@ dic@@ aps , however , there is no further justi@@ fic@@ ation@@ for continuing to pay development aid there .
that would be discrimin@@ atory in relation to@@ developed regions where aid sch@@ e@@ mes do no@@ top@@ er@@ ate .
regional development aid would then be illegal in the Commission '@@ s@@ view and would run counter to the Treaty 's objective of economic and soci@@ alco@@ hesion .
likewise , aid to restructure firms can be authorised if it is a one @@@ -@@ @ off@@ measure accompanied by a restructuring plan that is capable of rest@@ oring the@@ firm 's health and vi@@ ability .
the Commission considers that the figure is too high .
the Commission 's monitoring of State aid has a considerable impact on day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day life and offers three main beneficial effects .
it con@@ fines aid sch@@ e@@ mes to what is strictly necessary and thus avo@@ ids waste of public funds .
by prev@@ ent@@ ing@@ dist@@ or@@ tions of in@@ tra @@@ -@@ @ Community competition that would be dele@@ ter@@ ious to th@@ es@@ ing@@ le market , it boos@@ ts economic growth in the Union and promo@@ tes@@ employment as a result .
aid can take a variety of forms : grants and interest relief , of course , but also tax@@ relief .
aid can be given in the form of a State guarantee or holding , or even@@ provision by the State of goods and services on preferential terms .
article 8@@ 7@@ allows certain forms of aid : • aid having a social character , granted to individual consumers ;
• aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or excep@@ tion@@ alo@@ c@@ curren@@ ces ;
• aid designed to :
- facilitate the development of certain activities or areas ,
- promote culture and heritage conserv@@ ation ; where , in the last two cases , such aid does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is contrary to the common
the Commission has adopted a number of documents to clar@@ ify its State aid policy .
they are called " guidelines " or " fra@@ me@@ works . "
they concern regions lagging behind in terms of development , R & D , employment and training , small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized businesses , protection of the environment and the rescue and and 88 restructuring of firms in difficulty .
the Commission generally takes a favourable approach to such sch@@ e@@ mes as long as they do not dist@@ ort competition to an ex@@ t@@ ent@@ in@@ compatible with the common interest .
the Commission also scru@@ tin@@ ises aid sch@@ e@@ mes illegally implemented by the M@@ ember States without prior noti@@ fication and without awaiting author@@ isation .
it is@@ often ap@@ prised of such sch@@ e@@ mes via complaints from firms . in@@ compatible sch@@ e@@ mes@@ are banned , and the off@@ ending M@@ ember State may well be required to rec@@ over th@@ es@@ ums paid out .
the recipient of un@@ law@@ ful aid will have to pay it back .
certain forms of State financial support for firms can be an@@ ec@@ ess@@ ary means of tackling structural han@@ dic@@ aps and exc@@ ess costs flow@@ ing fro@@ m@@ location in such areas .
the objective of this aid is to help alleviate or even@@ remove a number of problems ( employment , development , et@@ c . ) facing certain@@ urban areas .
residents there are the immediate benefic@@ i@@ aries of such aid , wh@@ ich@@ the Commission looks on with some favour , particularly where it accompan@@ i@@ es@@ other Community programmes for the development of poo@@ rer areas .
regional aid for small businesses In February 1998 , the Commission approved aid totalling EU@@ R 1.@@ 89 million for@@ the development of small tourism businesses in the area of Do@@ ñ@@ ana , in southern Spain .
their chief purpose was to provi@@ de@@ incentives for investment in the formation of new@@ tourism businesses and the creation of jobs in@@ that industry .
they thus contributed to th@@ es@@ ust@@ ain@@ able development of this relatively poor@@ region of the Union .
An@@ dal@@ u@@ sia is a region eli@@ gi@@ ble@@ for special status as regards State aid under the Treaty , given that its standard of living is wel@@ l@@ below the Community average .
aid authorised condi@@ tionally
air transport Most national air@@ lines have responded to the liberalisation of air transport in Europe@@ by developing restructuring and rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation plans to restore the@@ ir@@ competitiveness .
in 1997 , the Commission gave conditional author@@ isation for@@ payment of aid worth EU@@ R 1 400 million to Al@@ ital@@ ia .
the Commission consider@@ ed@@ that the aid would be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the develop@@ ment@@ of air transport in Europe without adver@@ sel@@ y@@ affecting trade between M@@ ember States to an@@ extent contrary to the common interest .
it ac@@ ted@@ with the t@@ wo@@ fold concern to preserve a company in@@ the process of return to vi@@ ability on the air transpor@@ t@@ market without jeopardis@@ ing competition : consum@@ er@@ s@@ would benefit both from Al@@ ital@@ ia 's services and from those of its competitors .
motor industry The German authorities wanted to give Volk@@ sw@@ ag@@ en aid of EU@@ R 3@@ 98 million for@@ investment at two production sites in Germany .
thus , it adopted a partial neg@@ ati@@ ve@@ decision for an amount of EU@@ R 1@@ 23 million .
the Commission has always sou@@ gh@@ tto ensure that operating conditions in the motor industry are fair throughout Europe .
the effect of this balanced policy is to preserve competitiveness an@@ dem@@ plo@@ yment throughout the common market for the benefit of all th@@ os@@ e@@ employed in the motor industry .
and by dis@@ su@@ ading public authorities fro@@ m@@ giving systematic assistance , the Com@@ mission@@ contributes to reducing public expendi@@ ture and th@@ us@@ helps to lower the general tax burden .
a mer@@ ger between two super@@ market cha@@ ins is reported in the@@ press .
the new group will be the largest in the country and on@@ e@@ of the top three in the Union .
in my local area , there are on@@ ly@@ two large super@@ markets , each belonging to one of the t@@ wo@@ cha@@ ins in question .
at the moment , there is keen competi@@ tion@@ between the two super@@ markets in prices and promotional offer@@ s.@@ A@@ m I right in fearing that , after the mer@@ ger , this situation will@@ change and local competition will dis@@ appear ?
if so , what co@@ ul@@ d@@ the Commission do ?
in this case , the Commission has the power top@@ ro@@ hibi@@ t the mer@@ ger if it has a Community dimension and leads to the strengthening of a dominant position .
community dimension , the domestic competition authorities will as a rule have the power to take similar action .
this situation is illu@@ strated by the Kes@@ ko / T@@ uk@@ o ,
what scope is there for buying a car in another Community country ?
difference in the price of the same vehicle depending on whether it is bought in my country of residence or in the other M@@ ember State .
my deal@@ er has told me that I could not buy the@@ vehicle abroad as the manufacturer for@@ bids its deal@@ ers fro@@ m@@ making cross @@@ -@@ @ border sales .
is this possible ? is there a competition problem here ?
petrol prices have increased at filling stations .
is this the result of a restric@@ tive practice ?
petrol prices went up by the same amount on the same day in al@@ l@@ the petrol stations in my region .
is this price rise an example of@@ an agreement that restric@@ ts competition ?
should I complain to@@ the European Commission ?
a simultane@@ ous and i@@ den@@ tical rise in prices is not necessarily the result of concer@@ ted@@ action .
it may be the consequence of an increase in tax or in the price of crude oil , for example because of an international crisis .
where there is no explanation of th@@ is@@ kind , it might be that the price rise is the result of an agreement between fil@@ l@@ ing@@ station owners or oil companies .
an investigation would have to be conducted to@@ determine whether or not this was the case .
if a simultane@@ ous and i@@ den@@ tical ris@@ e@@ occur@@ s loc@@ ally , it is probably more appropriate to contact your domestic author@@ iti@@ es@@ than to report the matter to the Commission .
for instance , at the end of November 1999 , the Italian competition authority launched an investigation into as@@ us@@ pec@@ ted agreement between pet@@ ro@@ leum @@@ -@@ @ product manufac@@ turers in the fu@@ el@@ distribution sector in Italy .
prices have risen simultaneously in@@ several Community countries - is this as@@ ign of a restric@@ tive practice ?
every year I go on holiday to a Mediterranean island .
I usu@@ al@@ ly@@ take a fer@@ ry run by the U@@ ly@@ s@@ ses line , which offers the m@@ ost@@ attractive prices of the three companies operating at the port in question .
increased ste@@ ep@@ ly and the three companies had al@@ ig@@ ned the@@ ir@@ prices .
is this the result of an anti @@@ -@@ @ competitive agreement ? ?
the combination of a price rise and the al@@ ign@@ ment of prices between the thre@@ ec@@ om@@ pan@@ ies - the only three operating at the port - would seem to indic@@ ate@@ concer@@ ted action by the three firms .
if several M@@ ember States are involved , it might be advis@@ able to inform the European Commission .
certain per@@ fu@@ mes are on sale only in a perf@@ ume shop .
whatever happened to consumer choice ?
my wife asked me to buy a French perf@@ ume for my mother @@@ -@@ @ in@@ - law 's birthday .
I tried to find it in a super@@ market , but the sales
¿ assistant told me it was sold only in perf@@ ume shops .
are the@@ exclusive rights enjoyed by these shops legal ?
in the case of perf@@ ume shops , this service consist@@ s@@ of providing cust@@ o@@ mer advice , enabling customers to test the products and gi@@ v@@ ing@@ out samples .
such agreements are authorised because they are intended to@@ improve the distribution of goods .
in the face of red@@ un@@ dan@@ cies , what justi@@ fication is there for the Commission
declaring government aid illegal ?
the Commission has declared illegal the government aid gran@@ ted@@ to a firm where I am employed .
the firm is going to have to pay@@ back the aid to the government .
we fear that this decision may@@ lead to red@@ un@@ dan@@ cies .
I do not understand the Commission '@@ sat@@ titu@@ de .
however , the purpose of monitoring aid is not to undermine the vi@@ ability of firms . on the contrary , the goal is to ensure that firms rec@@ over a lasting vit@@ ality .
the Commission condem@@ ns State aid which serves to delay the restructuring measures needed to restore firms " competitiveness and to maintain arti@@ fic@@ ially jobs that will soon dis@@ appear .
it condem@@ ns such aid all the more as it dist@@ orts competition vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis firms or regions which have carried out restructuring measures without the benefit of such aid .
thus , aid granted to a firm in order temporarily to save its business and the jobs it provides may cause difficulties for several firms and thousands of workers that receive no government aid .
however , the Commission is in favour of aid for the restructuring of firms in difficulty , provided that it leads to the long @@@ -@@ @ term restoration of the firms " competitiveness .
how does the public benefit from th@@ eli@@ ber@@ alisation of services of general@@ interest ?
when sectors previously under a monopoly are opened up to@@ competition , does this not undermine services of general@@ interest ?
private firms have different objectives from public@@ services and I am afraid that the quest for profit may promp@@ t@@ these firms to abandon un@@ profitable activities or to be les@@ s@@ rigor@@ ous on matters of safety and public health .
what positi@@ ve@@ effects can the public eventually expect from liberalisation ?
in some sectors , for example air transport and telecommunications , liber@@ alis@@ ation@@ has clearly brought benefits to consumers , in terms of prices and the services on offer , without calling into question flight safety or access to telecommunications
X services in geo@@ graph@@ ically remote areas .
basic services such as comp@@ ul@@ sory education or social security are therefore excluded in principle fro@@ m@@ the liberalisation process .
the Commission also encour@@ ages M@@ ember States to set@@ up watchdog bodies to regulate liber@@ alised markets in order to prevent prac@@ tic@@ es@@ which would harm inter@@ mediate and final consumers .
so the public has gained agre@@ at deal from the policy of liberalisation : lower prices , a wider range of services , more efficient services and a guarantee of government scrutiny .
if you find that competition is appreci@@ ably affected as a result , you may file a complaint .
member States , you should contact the domestic competition authorities or law cour@@ t@@ son@@ ly , on the basis of the domestic competition law of the
how do I refer a case to the European Commission ?
once you have answ@@ ered these questions , what course of action can you consider taking ?
bas@@ ically , you have two cho@@ ices .
you may bring the problem to the attention of a consumer organis@@ ation@@ .@@ If the re@@ stri@@ ction of competition appreci@@ ably affects the common market , it is likely that the consumer organisation will already have received a number of similar complaints or letters .
it may then contact other national or
European associations and submit a dul@@ y substan@@ ti@@ ated complaint . it may file a complaint on behalf of consumers in the Union and establish the Community interest in the case .
for the sake of efficiency , both for the individual and for the
# authorities , it would seem prefer@@ able to choose this collective course of action .
when addressing a compla@@ in@@ tto the European Commission , whether it be an individual or a collective complaint , a simple let@@ ter@@ will su@@ ffic@@ e .
it must contain the following information :
• the compla@@ in@@ ant 's name and address ;
• the identity of the firm ( s ) in question ;
• evidence of the compla@@ in@@ ant 's legitimate interest in the matter ;
• a clear descri@@ ption of the subject matter of the complaint and a
% statement of the reasons for thinking that the practice in question inf@@ r@@ inges the rules of Community competition law .
# will the European Commission take ?
once it has received the complaint , the European Commission may act in one of two ways .
Commission , after going through the requ@@ isite proced@@ ural stages , will adopt a decision which may prohibi@@ t agreements , order an end to the off@@ ending

Enlargement will have some very positive environmental side effects : clean@@ er air , good @@@ -@@ @ quality drinking water and safer waste manag@@ em@@ ent@@ across Europe .
in short , better quality of life for millions of people - a good reason to achieve higher environmental standards .

this m@@ ight@@ look like bitter medicine tos@@ w@@ allow , but@@ there is more to@@ it .
a recent independent study ( 1 ) shows that the long@@ -
Im@@ pur@@ ities in the air do not only harm the@@ human@@ body : bla@@ c@@ ken@@ ed@@ and@@ cr@@ umb@@ l@@ ing@@ walls in@@ our cities demonstrate the dam @@@ -@@ @ aging power of pollution and ac@@ id rain .
In@@ the Czech Republic , lower air pollu@@ tion@@ should reduce the building sur@@ faces need @@@ -@@ @ ing maintenance by ar@@ oun@@ d@@ 2.@@ 6@@ milli@@ on@@ square meters in@@ 2010 .

city @@@ -@@ @ d@@ wel@@ lers are not@@ the only people to@@ enjoy the benefits of clean@@ er air : less sul@@ -
many candidate countries are still fac@@ ing@@ problems with@@ water supply bo@@ th@@ for@@ hous@@ ehol@@ d@@ and@@ industrial use .
No@@ te@@ ver@@ y@@ hous@@ ehol@@ d@@ has running drinking water , and water quality gives cause for concer@@ n@@ - cont@@ am@@ in@@ ation@@ by mic@@ rob@@ es , lead@@ and@@ p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des is no@@ tr@@ are .
implementing the EU water direc@@ tives across the candi@@ da@@ te@@ countries will tackle these problems .

for example , the Bulgarian whe@@ ath@@ ar@@ v@@ est could grow by 5 % in a few years if EU standards are applied .
So@@ how mu@@ ch@@ are we talking about ?

the main reasons are lower air and water@@ pollution and better waste management .
air knows no@@ fron@@ ti@@ ers , and@@ reduced pollution from the candidate countries co@@ ul@@ dal@@ so@@ bring public health@@ benefits wor@@ th@@ around 6.5 billion annually to ex@@ istin G EU M@@ ember States .
Russia , Ukraine and By@@ el@@ or@@ us@@ sia can also look forward to clean@@ er air thanks to their neighbours .
for industry , better water quality me@@ ans@@ lower production and maintenance costs , as equipment will n@@ ol@@ on@@ ger be dam@@ ag@@ ed@@ by dir@@ ty water .
C@@ le@@ and@@ rin@@ king water is vital to@@ human@@ life an@@ dis often viewed as a basic human@@ right .
but many sectors of the economy -

Com@@ pan@@ i@@ es@@ save time and money wh@@ en@@ they don@@ o@@ th@@ ave to@@ apply for separate permits fo@@ reac@@ h@@ of their operations .
another ad@@ van @@@ -@@ @ t@@ age is that EU direc@@ tives establish a com @@@ -@@ @ mon set of environmental rules all ac@@ ros@@ s@@ the Union .

the first step is to@@ assess what kinds of benefits are available in general ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . reduction in res@@ pir@@ atory diseases ) .
the second step is to estimate ho@@ w@@ large these benefits are ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . how many cases will be avoided ) .@@ Fin@@ ally , the monetary value of the benefits is evalu@@ ated ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . ho@@ w@@ much would the damages avoided be worth ) .
the benefits are estimated using several methods , for examp@@ le@@ calc@@ ulating the " avoided damage " : the reduction in cases of as@@ th@@ ma or use of primary materials .
another method is by analy@@ sing " willingness to pay " : the value people place on living in a clean@@ er@@ environment .
The@@ benef@@ it@@ stu@@ dy@@ estimates that , in Poland , the EU land@@ fill direc@@ tive will hel@@ p@@ to@@ increase the amoun@@ t@@ of waste th@@ atis@@ recy@@ cle@@ d@@ and@@ compos@@ ted@@ by over 10 M@@ il @@@ -@@ @ li@@ on@@ tonnes per year .
this will be a hu@@ ge@@ improvement , given that 98 % of Poland '@@ s@@ municipal waste currently goes into land @@@ -@@ @ filling .
in countries like Malta , where lan@@ dis a scar@@ ce resource , smaller waste vol@@ u@@ mes@@ will release more space for development .
boosting business
this is are@@ al incentive to strive for better environmental protection .
With@@ the EU environmental direc@@ tives , candidate countries are@@ already hal@@ f@@ way down the road . ❚
the figures sp@@ an a very wide range , simply because it is extremely difficult , for example , to measure the impact of air pollution . In@@ the same way , it is almost impossible to give a monetary value to@@ a human life .
for these reasons it would not be scienti@@ fic@@ ally honest to mention just one precise figure - the benefits must be se@@ en@@ as general estimates .

as well as offering this specific in@@ for@@ ma @@@ -@@ @ tion@@ to@@ coastal zone managers , the C@@ om @@@ -@@ @ mission@@ has produc@@ ed@@ abo@@ ok@@ let@@ for the@@ general public explaining the challen@@ ges@@ and objectives of In@@ tegrated Co@@ ast@@ al Zone Management .

the Commission ' s dem on stration on IC@@ Z@@ M illu@@ strated the importance of stake @@@ -@@ @ holder particip@@ ation@@ in good coastal z@@ on@@ em@@ an@@ agement .

preparing ( potential ) candidate countries for tomorrow
I believe that this is an important mutual learning exercise both for existing M@@ ember States and the Union 's future members .
regional Policy and enlargement ,
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a ge@@ ar through pre @@@ -@@ @ accession funding
enabling candidate countries to develop through the In@@ str@@ ument for P@@ re @@@ -@@ @ Accession Assistance
as European Enlargement continues Ap@@ ace , assistance given to Can@@ di@@ date Countries is becoming increasingly sophisticated .
in this article we look at how the original pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance has taken on new dimen@@ sions .
Croatia , like all candidate countries , can use EU assistance for environmental projects .
this broader framework gives candidate countries much more scope to develop their own economies and institutions and therefore the skills of their entrepreneurs and administr@@ ators .
pushing the boundaries further
pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance has previously focused on institutional building and investment in key areas of Community policies .
investment was implemented through the In@@ str@@ ument for
not only this , but national authorities are much more closely involved and with a greater degree of responsibility for strategic planning and
( 1 ) e legal basis for this assistance is Council Regula@@ tion ( EC ) No 10@@ 85 / 2006 , adopted on 17 July 2006 .
more detailed implementing rules are laid down in Commission Regula@@ tion ( EC ) No 7@@ 18 / 2007 of 12 June 2007 .
candidate countries will benefit for the first time from financing to cover activities that are similar to activities financed in EU M@@ ember States and regions under Co@@ hesion Policy instruments .
a significant share of IPA funds managed by the DG@@ s for Regional Policy and Employment are allocated to Lisbon @@@ -@@ @ type expendi@@ ture ( roughly 15 to 20 % of the overall programme allocation , depending on the country ) .
e five components of IPA
seeing the benefits of IPA
so far , perhaps the most impressive results of IPA were achieved during the preparation of the Oper@@ ational Program@@ mes .
components I and II are open to all benefic@@ i@@ ary countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey .
components III , I@@ V and V are open to candidate countries only ( name@@ ly the Republic of Croatia , the Republic of Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
their design mir@@ r@@ ors closely the management and programming principles of structural , co@@ hesion and rural development funds .
thus , IPA allows benefic@@ i@@ ary countries to participate at an early stage in managing these Community Co@@ hesion Policy instruments .
by gaining first @@@ -@@ @ hand experience at running these programmes , they will be well placed to absor@@ b future structural , co@@ hesion and rural development funds once they become available to them .
in this relatively short period ( programme preparations and negotiations took less than a year ) , essential preconditions and principles for successful implementation were agreed .
a quick look at some of the projects financed under IPA Com@@ pon@@ ent III demonstrates their diversity as well as their strategic importance .
major infrastructure projects are being financed under the Croatian Environmental Oper@@ ational Programme .
here new facilities are being financed for solid waste and waste water that fully respect relevant EU environmental standards .
the total project cost is estimated at € 68 million .
new waste water treatment plants and upgrading of se@@ w@@ er@@ age networks are also program@@ med for the towns of Slavon@@ ski Brod , K@@ nin and Dr@@ nis .
the total project costs are estimated at € 27 million and € 18 million respectively .
investment aid in candidate countries is only a frac@@ tion of the level of investment assistance available to M@@ ember Sta@@ tes@@ 2 , but it places a strong emphasis on building institutions and structures for the future .
it gives business leaders and civil servants a crucial experience in dev@@ ising and managing investment projects , preparing them for the time when they take on full control of St@@ ruc@@ tural Fund programmes .
the project will serve a population of approximately 4@@ 44 000 inhabitants
IPA funds are also available to potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans such as Bosnia and Herzegovina .
regional development : an important step towards EU membership for the Western Balkans
December 2005 marked an important milestone for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on its path to becoming a European Union ( EU ) member - the European Council awarded it the status of " candidate country . "
this her@@ al@@ ded the progress made by the country and opened new doors , giving it access to the five components of the instrument for pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance .
this has enabled the country to take an active role since 2007 in building its future as a stak@@ ehol@@ der in regional policy .
road construction activities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
as a result of the Regional Development component of pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance , a prec@@ ur@@ sor to the St@@ ruc@@ tural and Co@@ hesion F@@ unds , a strategy document has been developed by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
this strategic planning and sec@@ toral programming has given national authorities the opportunity to take responsibility for social and economic development in co@@ operation with civil society .
one of the main objectives of the Regional Development operational programme is to contribute to sustainable development and the regional integration of the country into the Western Balkans .
community aid will be concentrated initially on the transport and environment sectors - regional competitiveness is not expected to be incorpor@@ ated until 2010 .
e second project involves giving the 75 000 inhabitants of Prilep a reliable se@@ w@@ er@@ age system and a waste water treatment facility .
its resources in terms of soft water and bio@@ diversity make the country one of the principal natural reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s of the region .
heavy pollution caused by non @@@ -@@ @ treated waste water , as well as non @@@ -@@ @ treated urban and industrial water , is however a real threat for sustainable development and the quality of life for the inhabitants .
over recent years , the importance of supporting and encouraging cross@@ border co@@ operation for Europe 's regions has been recognised more and more widely .
border regions su@@ ff E@@ R from a number of specific dis@@ advantages compared to more central regions .
these factors are particularly ac@@ ute along the European Union 's external borders .
IPA cross@@ border co@@ operation programmes with EU M@@ ember State participation
Malta candidate or potential candidate countries on the other .
secondly , it supports cross@@ border co@@ operation between candidate and potential candidate countries themselves .
finally , the component may also support the involvement of candidate and potential candidate countries in trans@@ national co@@ operation programmes under the Ter@@ rit@@ orial Co@@ operation objective , in particular the south @@@ -@@ @ east Europe and Mediterranean programmes .
co@@ operation has long been a key component of EU Co@@ hesion Policy , fir@@ st@@ ly through the IN@@ T@@ ER@@ RE@@ G Community Initiative , and now via the European Ter@@ rit@@ orial Co@@ operation objective .
is article focuses on the first of these elements , which will support up to 12 programmes between the M@@ ember States and ( potential ) candidate countries ( see map ) .
most of these programmes are already up and running , and the first call for projects has already been completed for the Slovenia @@@ -@@ @ Croatia programme
strictly speaking , the IPA cross@@ border component supports three types of co @@@ -@@ @ operation .
fir@@ st@@ ly , it funds cross@@ border co@@ operation between M@@ ember States on the one hand and
regional Policy and enlargement , moving up a ge@@ ar through pre @@@ -@@ @ accession funding from the countries concerned , is responsible for running the programme , supported by a Sec@@ re@@ tariat staff@@ ed from both sides of the border .
moreover , all projects must have partners from both sides of the border and will be selected jointly by the participating countries , not by the Commission .
on one level therefore , the benefits of these cross@@ border co@@ operation programmes seem obvious .
two European z@@ o@@ os in Hungary and Serbia co @@@ -@@ @ operate to enhance education and environmental protection .
a new , more radical approach to cross@@ border Co@@ operation
however , cross@@ border co@@ operation is not , and can@@ not be , simply about the local level .
by working together in their common border regions , countries can address challenges that trans@@ cen@@ d political borders .
flood prevention is one such area , where flooding on one side of the border may have its root causes on the other side .
in addition , some local @@@ -@@ @ level projects may have links to national and European policy issues .
in this context , projects related to the Roma people , or to shared river bas@@ ins like the Danube and T@@ is@@ za , could be developed in the IPA cross@@ border programmes and might have an influence far beyond the local , cross@@ border area .
it is difficult to under@@ play the radical nature of the cross@@ border component of the IPA .
finally , there is another lay@@ er of benefits that should also be taken into account - these can be described as the institutional benefits for the ( potential ) candidate countries .
conclusions e first quarter of 2009 will be a key period for the IPA cross@@ border programmes .
it will be important to maintain visi@@ bility for all the programmes at this crucial stage .
exclu@@ ding them from cross@@ border co@@ operation would have been a very negative and counter@@ productive signal to send out .
as a result , all the countries concerned will benefit from being part of programmes implemented under a St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds approach even before they become candidate countries for accession to the Union .
is is the third main innovation of the cross@@ border component of the IPA .
in line with the aim of using these programmes to prepare for future St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds implementation , the IPA cross@@ border programmes will mir@@ ror St@@ ruc@@ tural F@@ unds rules as closely as pos@@ si@@ ble@@ . is means fir@@ st@@ ly that the programmes are run on a multi@@ annual basis .

building a clean@@ er future
as Bulgaria reaches towards its future within the EU , funding under the structural policy for pre @@@ -@@ @ accession is helping one town modernise its environment@@ ally cont@@ am@@ in@@ ating waste disposal and water systems .
waste water from one of the town 's out@@ flows being dis@@ charged into the Danube in R@@ use , Bulgaria .
waste water and was@@ ted water - twin problems
when water does flow from the domestic ta@@ p , it will have travelled through approximately 4@@ 47 km of frac@@ turing , cr@@ umb@@ ling pip@@ es , 64 % of which are constructed from as@@ bes@@ tos cement .
e Danube flows past the Bulgarian town of R@@ use , bringing with it trade , visitors and cultural exchange - much as it has done since the Roman@@ s first settled here .
when it flows away from R@@ use it takes not only bar@@ ges and cruise ships with it - but also the entire town 's un@@ treated se@@ w@@ er@@ age .
from the van@@ t@@ age point of one of the town 's out@@ flows , dis@@ charging around 240 000 lit@@ res a second , ' Blue Danube ' seems to be a mis@@ no@@ mer .
all this is set to change by the end of 2010 , when the results of Bulgaria 's most extensive water project take effect .
it will deliver : new , more efficient pum@@ ps ; 10 replacement hydro@@ pho@@ res ensuring constant supply to the town 's high @@@ -@@ @ rise buildings ;
turning waste into power
now manager of Vi@@ K , five years ago Sav@@ ov was the head of a technical unit trying to keep the town 's failing se@@ w@@ er@@ age system going : " I remember we had a block@@ age and I went down into the collec@@ tor to clear it .
Am@@ mon@@ ium will have been ox@@ i@@ dis@@ ed to form nit@@ rate which will then be reduced into elementary nit@@ ro@@ gen and the ph@@ os@@ ph@@ orus pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated out .
once air dri@@ ed and subj@@ ected to four phases of ana@@ ero@@ bic treatment , the s@@ lu@@ dge ends up in a di@@ ges@@ ter tank where the resulting me@@ than@@ e produced will be collected and stored in a 900 m@@ 2 gas holder .

many challenges and discover@@ ies lie on the road to EU Accession .
the economic and structural developments that accession economies have to achieve put them all on a steep learning cur@@ ve , but this process gener@@ ates economic streng@@ ths that stand the test of time .
the Republic of Croatia is a good example of a candidate country facing up to the challenges of accession .
Croatia started the accession negotiations in October 2005 and , providing all pre @@@ -@@ @ accession criteria are met , is hoping to complete the process by the end of 2009 .

income levels la@@ gged too far below the EU average and growth rates were vari@@ able .
soci@@ o@@ economic difficulties remain an issue , along with new environmental standards to meet .
for Croatia , it is the third component ( I@@ I@@ IC ) covering regional development and competitiveness which is particularly crucial and projects worth € 3@@ 5.@@ 35 million are scheduled for 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 09 .
Croatia 's natural beauty is a potential source of economic ri@@ ches .

a further dimension of this priority is focusing on technology transfer and creating the right infrastructure and services to bring new products to the market@@ place .
here public institutions are having to get to gri@@ ps with entrepreneur@@ ial skills and managing intellectual property issues .
Bi@@ o@@ Center , which will be located on Zagreb university camp@@ us , will also play an important role in bringing the University closer to the market .
investment Pri@@ orities e En@@ d G@@ ame e first investment priority therefore focuses on building infrastructure in 10 of the least developed coun@@ ties , combined with human resources investments to strengthen the under@@ lying business environment .
in this last phase of pre @@@ -@@ @ accession , Croatian SM@@ E@@ s are generally still finding it difficult to maintain competitiveness .
unless this is dealt with now , such weaknesses could repeatedly cro@@ p up in the bra@@ ve new world of the Sing@@ le European Market .

a vast amount of detailed preparation has gone into drafting the RC@@ O@@ P and its implementation .
it has been difficult , but all the pieces are now in place for some exc@@ iting economic developments , as well as providing the tools for evalu@@ ating future projects under the IPA .
where competitiveness is low , projects will concentr@@ ate heavily on promoting basic infrastructure , entrepreneur@@ ship and start @@@ -@@ @ up , consul@@ tancy and financial support , together with inter@@ regional and inter@@ institutional partnership activities .
tourism projects will be a further tool for boosting businesses .
in regions with medium levels of competitiveness , projects will focus on building institutional structures , business consul@@ tancy services , product development and creating partnerships within regions and between them .
where partnerships between sectors show potential for business growth , these will be encouraged if they are not anti@@ competitive .
tourism projects will again be a tool for business development .

getting ready for IPA - the accredi@@ tation process of the management and control systems in Croatia
in 2005 Croatia was informed of the intention of the EU to launch IPA and thus replace the existing pre @@@ -@@ @ accession assistance programmes from 2007 .
since then , Croatia has been actively preparing for management and implementation of funds within IPA .
throughout the whole process , intensive and close co@@ operation was established with the relevant services of the European Commission .
advisory missions were carried out to provide assistance to the Croatian authorities in building up the necessary institutional , management and control capacities .
• as@@ signing responsibilities at institutional and individual level taking into account the need for adequate se@@ gre@@ gation of duties ( in particular as regards internal au@@ dit and external au@@ dit functions ) .
overall , these challenges have been successfully tack@@ led .
Croatia is no st@@ ran@@ ger to the euro and soon Zagreb will be managing its own IPA funds .
e conclusion of the ver@@ ification au@@ dit is that the overall system for the management and control of IPA program is comp@@ li@@ ant with the requirements .
e main challenges that the Croatian authorities had to face in their progress towards accredi@@ tation were the following :
• procedures for accredi@@ tation and con@@ fer@@ r@@ al of management of EU funds under decentral@@ ised systems are new , • the EU 's strict requirements in relation to de@@ signing and implementing sound financial management systems ,

Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - leading the way in cross@@ border co@@ operation
co@@ operation in the remote mountain regions near the Bulgarian @@@ -@@ @ FYROM border has already been successful .
C@@ BC projects are based on a big vision for building wider European co@@ operation and integration which will in turn achieve sustainable development in border regi@@ on@@ s@@ . e main priorities are economic development , social co@@ hesion and improving the quality of life .
by reducing regional im@@ balan@@ ces people benefit on both sides of a border and the regions become stronger overall .
e first programme to be approved by the European Commission on 14 December 2007 was between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
its pro@@ active approach reflects the joint work of the teams in the partner@@ ing countries , excellent Co@@ ordination and the determination to overcome all the challenges along the way .
e programme is partly a logical continuation of existing relations developed through the EU Ex@@ ternal Border Initiative in 2003 and continued through the Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood Programme .
a sn@@ ap@@ shot of the Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood Programme
a wide variety of projects were successfully implemented under the Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood Programme .
here are just a couple of examples among many .
aside from the form@@ ality of the measures , it 's encouraging to think of real people coming together from different organisations and communities with common goals to achieve .
no future without sustainability
an integrated project " No Borders Re@@ qu@@ ired " ran between the municipalities of Sim@@ it@@ ly and Kar@@ bin@@ t@@ si .
joint activities were introduced in the sp@@ here of health protection and improving the quality of life of young people in the cross@@ border region .
it is a lasting example of integrated work carried out by both local authorities .
economic gains by themselves would be hol@@ low if they did not also ensure sustainable growth and the preservation and development of natural and cultural resources , which constitute key assets in this border region .
sustainable projects have a particularly bright future in the tourism sector , where new business opportunities can also offer sound green cre@@ denti@@ als .
another project called " The Moun@@ tains Ar@@ e Jo@@ ining H@@ ands " delivered sustainable benefits through new ways of managing and developing natural , cultural and historic resources .
it ran between the municipalities of D@@ up@@ n@@ itsa and Kri@@ va P@@ alan@@ ka and upgraded the comple@@ mentary project of R@@ ila and Ko@@ chan@@ i .
on 13 March 2008 in Ky@@ ust@@ en@@ dil , Bulgaria the first Joint Monitoring Committee meeting was held .

e real start of the programme - the first call for proposals - will be launched during the last quarter of 2008 , when applicants will be able to send their project proposals to the programme secre@@ tariat in Ky@@ ust@@ en@@ dil .
economic development , social co@@ hesion and improving the quality of life are the main priorities of cross@@ border co@@ operation projects .

participants agreed that measuring the impact of EU activities and also the effectiveness of public@@ ity measures via public surveys is one of the most objective meth@@ od@@ s@@ 5. e surveys , accompanied by analysis , also draw lessons for the more efficient promotion of EU structural interven@@ tions .
Communic@@ ating projects - how to present them attr@@ actively to the media and the public
he added that improving communications in the current climate of a dis@@ connection between Europe and its citizens is both a political and legal necess@@ ity .
since Co@@ hesion Policy accounts for nearly one third of EU budget expendi@@ ture , it is crucial to highlight its achievements and the value it gener@@ ates for ordinary Europeans .
e workshop set out to collect ideas and experiences on the most effective and interesting ways of presenting projects in order to generate media attention and public interest .
it began with a presentation by Anna Bug@@ al@@ ska ( Ministry for Regional Development , Poland ) of the camp@@ ain " Poland Gro@@ wing Be@@ autiful ! e " S@@ even mir@@ ac@@ les of EU funds " competition , " which provided the basis for discussion and raised various questions .

a new tool was also unveiled : a c@@ lic@@ kable map leading to national or regional websites providing lists of benefic@@ i@@ aries .
currently most EU countries are marked in grey , which means they have yet to disclose benefic@@ i@@ aries .
M@@ r Hall stressed that our aim should be to have all countries col@@ oured green on the map by the end of 200@@ 84 .
in the afternoon inform members had the opportunity to scru@@ tin@@ ise and discuss selected aspects of communication during three parallel workshops .
following the comments received during the day , future meetings will evol@@ ve towards a 1.5 / 2@@ day form@@ at , providing more time for networking and in @@@ -@@ @ dep@@ th discussions among inform members .

a number of recent initiatives reflect that quality control in education is an important issue on the political agenda of the European Commission as well as in many European countries .
within the Lisbon process , enhancing the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in Europe is one of the three main goals to be achieved in the period up to 2010 .
in this context , the European Commission has set up an expert group on " Im@@ proving the Education of Te@@ ach@@ ers and tra@@ in@@ ers . "
the group has identified the development of systems for the evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the initial and in@@ service education of teachers as one of the priorities involved in improving teacher education .
concern for quality assur@@ ance in teacher education is closely linked to the broader context of the development of higher education and the follow@@ up of the Bologna Process .
they should also commit themselves exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly to the development of a culture which recognises the importance of quality , and quality assur@@ ance , in their work . "
in light of the Lisbon and Bologna processes , the European Commission asked Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce in the autumn of 2004 to carry out a study on regulations for the evaluation of teacher education in European countries .
this survey analy@@ ses processes for evalu@@ ating and accredi@@ ting initial and in@@ service teacher education programmes and institutions .
a review of the main debates and reforms concerning this issue is also included .

this study is concerned with processes for evalu@@ ating and accredi@@ ting institutions and programmes for initial and in@@ service teacher education .
the evalu@@ ations concerned result in reports or recommendations drawn up for each institution or programme evalu@@ ated .
evalu@@ ations of the education system as a whole that lead solely to general reports on the state of that system are not a central aspect of the study .
only types of evaluation focusing on the quality of provision of teacher education are taken into account .
financial audi@@ ts and safety , security or environmental controls are not taken into account .
the education and training of teachers for voc@@ ational education is not included .
the reference year for data is 2005 / 06 .
recent and forthcoming reforms are also considered .
in all cases , the information shown in the F@@ ig@@ ures rela@@ tes to official regulations or recommendations .
meth@@ od@@ ology and defin@@ itions
the questionnaire prepared by the Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce European Unit for gathering the necessary information is available on the Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce website ( see www.@@ eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce@@ .org ) .
the questionnaire was dev@@ ised for gathering similar and read@@ ily compar@@ able information from all countries but also included sp@@ aces for describing special national character@@ isti@@ cs .
the present compar@@ ative study carried out with reference to the rep@@ lies obtained from these questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res , has been commented on and checked by the 30 Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce Network member countries ( 1 ) .
some information of specifically national re@@ lev@@ ance has been included for illu@@ str@@ ative purposes .
for the purposes of this study , evaluation and accredi@@ tation have been defined as follows :
evaluation is a general process of systematic and critical analysis leading to judg@@ ments and / or recommendations for improvement regarding the quality of a ( teacher ) education institution or programme .
the accredi@@ tation procedure pre@@ sup@@ poses that the programmes or institutions to be accredi@@ ted are evalu@@ ated .
structure and content
the first four chapters are concerned with the evaluation and / or the accredi@@ tation of institutions and programmes for initial teacher education .
more specifically , C@@ hap@@ ter 1 provides a general over@@ view of the existence of regulations on external and internal evaluation in the countries covered .
it also indicates whether these regulations are specific to teacher education or generally applic@@ able to all higher education institutions .
chapters 2 and 3 deal respectively with the main features of external and internal evaluation .
they describe the various players involved , as well as their qualifications , the documents which have to be used in identi@@ fying criteria , the focus and procedures of evaluation and its frequ@@ ency .
chapter 4 discusses use of the findings from external and internal evaluation .
chapter 5 considers the evaluation and accredi@@ tation of institutions or programmes for in@@ service teacher education .
it exam@@ ines whether regulations govern the evaluation or accredi@@ tation of the various types of in@@ service education providers in each country .
it then describes the bodies responsible for this kind of evaluation and accredi@@ tation , the procedures applied , their focus , frequ@@ ency and the use made of their findings .
finally , the main issues and results of the study are sum@@ mar@@ ised .
a g@@ los@@ s@@ ary and an an@@ ne@@ x describing the various types of internal and external evaluation of initial teacher education by country is included at the end of the study
out of the 30 countries considered in this report , all except Luxembourg have a regulated system for evalu@@ ating initial teacher education .
however , the extent to which such evaluation procedures are regulated may differ from one country to the next .
evaluation may also occur without following any officially binding regulations .
if information is available on current quality assur@@ ance practices , it is provided in the appropriate sections of this report .
norm@@ ally , initial teacher education for all three educational levels considered here ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) is evalu@@ ated , except in three countries .
the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium provides initial teacher education solely for primary education while , in Cyprus , only institutions training teachers for primary level ( and some teachers of English at secondary level ) are evalu@@ ated .
in general , teacher education for secondary level is provided at universities , for which there is currently no regulated system of evaluation .
in contrast , in Austria , regulations on evaluation only exist for universities training teachers for secondary level .
some countries evaluate their entire system of teacher education .
the purpose of a broader approach of this kind is not to focus primarily on individual institutions , but rather to monitor the whole system of initial teacher education .
it may provide either a basis for reform or an evaluation of newly implemented reforms , as shown in the examples below .
as such procedures do not occur in all countries , these evalu@@ ations are not considered in detail in the present analysis .
in Denmark in October 2003 , the Danish Institute of E@@ valu@@ ation ( E@@ va ) published an evaluation of initial teacher education programmes for comp@@ ul@@ sory education ( fol@@ kes@@ k@@ ole ) .
the entire system , including all 18 teacher education col@@ leg@@ es , was evalu@@ ated based on the internal evaluation reports from all institutions .
the purpose of the evaluation was to assess the programme in general , and no individual recommendations were made .
in Malta , the implementation of the teacher education programmes revised in 1999 is being evalu@@ ated in 2005 / 06 .
in Sweden , initial teacher education at all 25 institutions and the teacher education reform from 2001 in particular were evalu@@ ated in 2004 , and the results were reported back to the government in spring 2005 .
this was part of the reform and is also a regular part of the evaluation system for all higher education .
in the United Kingdom ( Wal@@ es ) , a review of the provision of initial teacher education on behalf of the Wel@@ sh Assembly Government has been under@@ way since 2005 .
the overall objective is to see how initial teacher education provision could meet demands more appropri@@ ately and encourage under @@@ -@@ @ represented groups to te@@ ach in future .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the In@@ spec@@ torate of Education is also authorised to inspect initial teacher education through a process known as aspect Revi@@ ew .
this looks at how a certain aspect of initial teacher education is being dealt with across the whole of the system , rather than just within a specific institution .
following an aspect Revi@@ ew , comments may be made about individual institutions as well as at system level .
between 2004 and 2006 in Norway , all general teacher education programmes will be evalu@@ ated as part of one large project .
in 24 countries or regions , only general regulations for the evaluation of all higher education apply to the evaluation of teacher education ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1.1 ) .
apart from the legislative framework for the evaluation or accredi@@ tation of higher education , no specific evaluation systems are ge@@ ar@@ ed to teacher education .
in six countries , evaluation of teacher education is govern@@ ed by both general and specific regulations .
in most cases , specific regulations apply to a particular stage of initial teacher education .
this may be the professional training phase or a particular part of it in the consecutive model , or the indu@@ ction phase .
in Germany , specific regulations apply solely to the evaluation of the final " on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ job " qualifying ( indu@@ ction ) phase , which is organised by the teacher training institu@@ tes ( Stu@@ di@@ en@@ semin@@ are ) .
in Ireland , the provision of final teaching practice is evalu@@ ated separately .
in Poland , teacher education provided by universities is evalu@@ ated in accordance with general regulations for quality control in higher education , whereas specific regulations apply in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .
in the United Kingdom , there are arrangements for the review of all higher education institutions by the Qu@@ ality As@@ surance Agency ( Q@@ A@@ A ) .
in England , Wal@@ es and Northern Ireland , there are separate arrangements , established by law , for the school inspec@@ tor@@ ates to evaluate programmes of initial teacher education .
the situation is similar in Scot@@ land .
these specific arrangements cover programmes leading to teacher qualifications .
these arrangements also cover employment @@@ -@@ @ based routes and , in England only , programmes offered by school @@@ -@@ @ cent@@ red training consorti@@ a .

General regulations apply to the evaluation of all higher education ( including initial teacher education ) .
specific regulations apply to the evaluation of initial teacher education programmes or institutions .
as will be explained in these chapters , external and internal evalu@@ ations are often very closely inter@@ related ; one type of evaluation might rely on the results of the other , or each might draw on the other 's findings .
in some countries , evaluation may be regarded as a single process consisting of one stage completed by persons inside an institution , and another stage carried out ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
in several countries , regulations provide for more than one evaluation procedure , including external and / or internal evaluation . there are various reasons for this : different components or stages of education
chapters 2 and 3 , which deal with external and internal evaluation respectively , take such differences into account where necessary ( for more country @@@ -@@ @ specific details ple@@ ase refer to the An@@ ne@@ x ) .
external evaluation is comp@@ ul@@ sory in most countries and is recommended in Germany , Spain and France .
in Germany , the presidents of universities or col@@ leg@@ es of education may recommend an external evaluation if their assessment of internal evaluation results convinc@@ es them of the necess@@ ity to do so .
in any case , before October 2010 , universities will have to undergo an accredi@@ tation process .
external evaluation is op@@ tional in Austrian universities , which provide teacher education for academic secondary schools .
the situation is similar in Denmark .
in Italy and Malta , there is no reference to external evaluation in official regulations .
the situation is quite similar in the case of internal evaluation , which is comp@@ ul@@ sory in the majority of countries and recommended in Spain , France , Cyprus and Slovenia .
in Spain , internal evaluation is regulated by each institution 's sel@@ f@@ evaluation plans , as well as by the aims , activities and programmes currently developed and promoted by the AN@@ EC@@ A .
in France , internal evaluation is recommended prior to external evalu@@ ations for contr@@ actual purposes .
universities in Slovenia strongly advis@@ e their member fac@@ ul@@ ties to carry out internal evaluation .
1 ) In Romania , initial teacher education for primary school teachers may also be provided at up@@ per secondary level .
however , the present report is limited to the evaluation of teacher education at ter@@ ti@@ ary level .

Denmark : for internal evaluation , the information shown rela@@ tes to universities only .

Cyprus : the information rela@@ tes solely to the external evaluation of col@@ leg@@ es providing initial teacher education for primary education .
there is no external evaluation system for the university .
however , in 2001 , the university requested the European University Association to organise an institutional quality review , which was repeated in 2004 .
Austria : the figure only ref@@ ers to initial teacher education provided by universities .
the future law on the new P@@ ä@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ is@@ che Ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ len also fore@@ sees external and internal evaluation for teacher education institutions .
however , several of them have carried out internal evalu@@ ations in recent years and have also been evalu@@ ated ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally .
United Kingdom : there is no exp@@ li@@ cit direc@@ tive to undertake internal evaluation for higher education institutions .
they are autonomous , and each has its own internal procedures for at@@ taining appropriate standards and ass@@ uring the quality of its provision .
all providers of initial teacher education must system@@ atically monitor and evaluate all aspects of provision in order to improve quality .
evaluation undertaken by bodies or persons not directly involved in the activities of the particular programme or institution concerned is generally referred to as external evaluation .
it is a process where@@ by data , information , and evidence relating to individual institutions or programmes are collected in order to make a statement about their quality .
norm@@ ally carried out by a team of experts , pe@@ ers or inspectors , this external review aims to reach an independent jud@@ gement concerning the quality of education provided within a particular setting .
this chapter will therefore consider the following : the one or more bodies responsible for external evaluation and the qualifications required of external evalu@@ ators ; the official documents which have to be used to draw up external evaluation criteria ; the precise scope of external evaluation ; the procedures and mechanisms on which it reli@@ es ; the frequ@@ ency of external evaluation .
responsible bodies and qualifications required of evalu@@ ators
regulations concerning the bodies responsible for external evaluation exist in all countries where there are formal requirements for external evaluation .
in the majority of them , such evaluation is carried out by an evaluation agency , committee or independent body acting on behalf of the public authorities .
in Belgium ( F@@ le@@ mis@@ h Community ) , the Netherlands , Slovenia and Slovakia , a committee and an independent body together co@@ ordinate the external evaluation procedure , whereas in Germany , this collaboration is op@@ tional .
in Cyprus , Poland ( in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es ) and Iceland , the Ministry of Education is directly responsible for external evaluation .
in the United Kingdom ( England , Wal@@ es and Northern Ireland ) , initial teacher education is evalu@@ ated ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally by the schools inspec@@ torate .
this is also the case in Ireland in respect of teaching practice .
an education agency performs this task in Sweden and the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) .

Finland : FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC also often uses pe@@ er evaluation .
in Latvia , their involvement is comp@@ ul@@ sory except when first @@@ -@@ @ level professional higher education programmes ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 5@@ B ) or col@@ leg@@ es are evalu@@ ated .
in the other countries , foreign participation is recommended .
only in Belgium ( F@@ le@@ mis@@ h Community ) , the Netherlands , Finland , Sweden and Norway is it comp@@ ul@@ sory or recommended to include students in the team of external evalu@@ ators .
in Germany , their involvement is op@@ tional .
several countries specify more precisely the composition of their evaluation committee .
in the Czech Republic , the accredi@@ tation commission consists of 21 members appointed by the government upon nomination by the minister for a six @@@ -@@ @ year term .
membership in the accredi@@ tation commission is in@@ compatible with the duties of the rec@@ tor , vice @@@ -@@ @ rec@@ tors and de@@ ans .
in Spain , the external evaluation committee has to be well balanced in terms of the training and experience of its members .
in Portugal , people with recognised expertise in the educational , artistic , scientific and entrepreneur@@ ial fields are eligible for appointment as external evalu@@ ators .
in Finland , the Ministry of Education appoin@@ ts a committee consisting of 12 members with a good understanding of evaluation , who represent universities , pol@@ y@@ techn@@ ics , students and employers .
a variety of official documents may be recommended or required as the basis for external evaluation criteria .
in Belgium ( French Community ) , Lithuania , Poland and Romania , all documents listed here are taken into account for drawing up evaluation criteria .
the situation is similar in the Netherlands and Sweden .
in Denmark , Austria and Finland , there are no regulations regarding the documents to be taken into account .
legislation on higher education and a list of evaluation criteria are the official sources most often used in the context of external evaluation .
the majority of countries also refer to one or several documents which deal specifically with teacher education .
thir@@ teen countries or regions use a document on qualification standards for prospec@@ tive teachers for the purpose of external evaluation .
several countries make use of other specific documents relating to teacher education .
these may be regulations or guidelines .
the " guidelines for initial Te@@ acher Education courses " in Scot@@ land give regulations on the requirements for initial teacher education and specify such things as the length of programmes , the amount of school experience and comp@@ ul@@ sory programme elements .
the " Standard for initial Te@@ acher Education : bench@@ mark Information " contains a set of benchmarks against which programmes can be considered and a set of expected features which students should have at@@ tained at the end of their programmes .
the E@@ valu@@ ation Framework for the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of Program@@ mes of initial Te@@ acher Education and the Ar@@ ran@@ gements for the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of Program@@ mes of initial Te@@ acher Education give detailed gu@@ idance on how the accredi@@ tation process works .
the Czech Republic , Greece , Spain , Ireland , Cyprus , Hungary , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia , Iceland and Norway do not stip@@ ulate the use of documents devoted specifically to initial teacher education for external evaluation .
however , these countries have all adopted lists of criteria , some of which may involve aspects directly relating to teacher education .
some countries report the existence of " gu@@ ides " or " questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res " for external evaluation .
in Latvia , for example , the Hig@@ her Education Qu@@ ality E@@ valu@@ ation Centre has developed a questionnaire for evaluation experts , which consists of questions regarding the main quality aspects to be evalu@@ ated .
although it may not be defined as a stat@@ ut@@ ory list , it is norm@@ ally used by experts to facilitate the evaluation process and to prepare reports on the institutions evalu@@ ated .

the scope of external evaluation may en@@ comp@@ ass a wide variety of issues .
it may be concerned with the results of internal evaluation , the content of the curricul@@ um for teacher education , teaching methods ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . how the content of that curricul@@ um is ta@@ ught ) , or assessment practices .
many countries focus their external evaluation on all or almost all of these issues .
only Ireland ref@@ ers to relatively few of them .
the regulations of almost all countries state that external evaluation has to take account of internal evaluation procedures or recommend that it should do so .
in Denmark , Austria , Finland and Sweden , there are no regulations concerning the scope of external evaluation .
this does not imply that the issues mentioned in F@@ ig@@ ure 2.@@ 4 are not usually covered .
in these countries , the external evalu@@ ator or the institutions requ@@ esting an evaluation decide about its scope .
FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC can also make an agreement with the ministry of education on evaluation as@@ sign@@ ments .
moreover , institutions and student unions can propose su@@ itable evaluation topics to FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC .
virtually all countries with regulations evaluate the content of teacher education .
either methods of teaching or assessment are also considered in all countries , except in France , Latvia ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) and Iceland ( in the case of evaluation of the institution ) .
additional criteria are mentioned by a few countries .
external evaluation in the United Kingdom ( England ) exam@@ ines whether training meets the needs of individual tra@@ ine@@ es and how applicants for training are selected .

for the defin@@ ition of internal evaluation , general teacher education and professional teacher training , ple@@ ase refer to the g@@ los@@ s@@ ary .
external evaluation may be conducted in different ways .
it is norm@@ ally based on a site visit and on an internal evaluation report .
such a visit may include interviews or surveys with the management , academic and administrative staff as well as with students .
ob@@ serv@@ ations directly linked to student teachers being ta@@ ught may also be included .
in Finland , the higher education institutions under review comp@@ ile sel@@ f@@ evaluation reports for the external evaluation team .
this team visits the higher education institutions involved and writes a review report .
besides this basic method , FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC also uses other evaluation methods such as portfol@@ ios , pe@@ er evaluation and bench@@ marking .
site visits are comp@@ ul@@ sory or recommended for external evaluation everywhere , except in Slovenia and Slovakia , where they are op@@ tional .
in Slovenia , external evaluation is based on the documentation submitted by higher education institutions applying for evaluation .
in the majority of countries , site visits include interviews with the management and with academic and administrative staff .
regulations also provide frequently for interviews with students .
in many countries , regulations of the evaluation process provide for interviews with all three categories of participants .
in Latvia and the Netherlands , interviews with students are comp@@ ul@@ sory , whereas interviews with the management and staff are op@@ tional .
as a general rule , a particular person may not attend more than one meeting .
the committee will ensure that its interviews with different groups focus on those aspects previously analy@@ sed which have yi@@ elded contra@@ dic@@ tory findings , or which seem especially important , are unclear or are not sufficiently conclu@@ sive .
class@@ room ob@@ servation ( in the institution providing initial teacher education ) can@@ not be regarded as among the main procedures in external evaluation .
yet while there is no reference to it in the regulations of most countries , it is nevertheless comp@@ ul@@ sory in nine of them .
in the United Kingdom ( England ) , interviews with staff in partnership schools are included in the procedures .
the results of internal evaluation are taken into consideration in almost all places where regulations exist .
elsewhere , external evalu@@ ators make use of internal evaluation reports that are not produced specifically for purposes of external evaluation .

United Kingdom : the information provided rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
explan@@ atory note For the defin@@ ition of site visit , ple@@ ase refer to the g@@ los@@ s@@ ary .
in most European countries , external evaluation of institutions and programmes providing initial teacher education takes place at fixed inter@@ vals which are determined at central or higher level .
in some countries , there are several types of external evaluation with different fixed inter@@ vals .
in ten countries or regions , the inter@@ vals specified correspon@@ d to maximum periods , which means that external evaluation may occur more often .
the highest frequ@@ ency relating specifically to the evaluation of initial teacher education is noted in Ireland ( evaluation of teaching practice ) and the United Kingdom ( England ) .
each year in Ireland , 10 % of students in their final year of teacher education for primary schools are selected for assessment during their teaching practice .
the institutions in which they enrol@@ led receive an evaluation report .
regular evalu@@ ations for the renewal of accredi@@ tation are then generally planned within a period ranging from three to twelve years after the prec@@ eding evaluation .
in Latvia , the external evaluation enabling new institutions to be accredi@@ ted for the first time is norm@@ ally not repeated .
in Slovenia , prior to the new law on higher education issued in 2004 , a similar situation was in force concerning teacher education programmes .
on the contrary , in Latvia , the re@@ accredi@@ tation of teaching programmes is mandatory .
in Sweden , regular evaluation linked to the ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation of higher education institutions is carried out , but no procedure is planned for new programmes or institutions .

additional notes Belgium ( B@@ E de ) : the information rela@@ tes solely to evaluation of institutions providing initial teacher education for primary education .
for general secondary education , teacher education is provided outside the Community .
for the latter , the distinc@@ t inter@@ vals shown depend on the length of teacher training .
accredi@@ tation is awarded for at most twice the standard length of study programmes .
Denmark : the Center for Vi@@ der@@ eg@@ å@@ en@@ de Ud@@ d@@ ann@@ else are given the possibility to participate in a single accredi@@ tation process allowing them to obtain the quality la@@ bel of University Col@@ leg@@ es .

France : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to evaluation carried out by the des ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation carried out by the C@@ NE and the IG@@ A@@ EN@@ R .
once an institution has been accredi@@ ted , a second evaluation occur@@ s after four years .
then , evaluation occur@@ s after a further ten years .
a draft law has been tab@@ led with a view to performing external evalu@@ ations every four years .
Latvia : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to external evaluation of programmes ; and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of institutions .
Austria : the figure only ref@@ ers to initial teacher education provided by universities .
Slovenia : the new ( 2004 ) law on higher education has established the principle of comp@@ ul@@ sory re@@ accredi@@ tation every seven years , with effect from 2005 .
this will be applied to institutions for teacher education once they have designed their study programmes according to the Bologna requirements .
Slovakia : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to external evaluation of programmes ; and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of institutions .
Sweden : an inter@@ val of six years between external evalu@@ ations is norm@@ ally the rule for higher education institutions .
however , an extra evaluation of teacher education programmes will occur in 2006 , two years after the previous evaluation .
this is an excep@@ tional situation linked to the monitoring of the 2001 reform of programmes for initial teacher education ( see chapter 1 ) .
United Kingdom ( EN@@ G / W@@ LS / N@@ I@@ R ) : the information provided rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
in England , programmes for teacher education are to be evalu@@ ated at least twice in the six @@@ -@@ @ year period from 2005 to 2011 .
in Wal@@ es , the aim is to complete the current cycle of inspec@@ tions by 2008 , after which a different cycle will be introduced . United Kingdom ( SC@@ T ) : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to evaluation of all higher education institutions ; and ( 2 ) to evaluation of institutions for initial teacher education .
in ten countries or regions , the inter@@ val between external evalu@@ ations var@@ ies according to the programme or institution .
in France , institutions for teacher education have to undergo one type of external evaluation that occur@@ s at regular inter@@ vals and another whose frequ@@ ency var@@ ies .
in the Czech Republic , the inter@@ val between evalu@@ ations of study programmes is fixed by regulations , which is not the case for institutions .
several scenarios are possible in cases where the frequ@@ ency of external evaluation var@@ ies according to the programme or institution .
in the Czech Republic , where evaluation is concerned with similar types of programme , the education fac@@ ul@@ ties were last evalu@@ ated in 1997 / 98 .
in Iceland , external evalu@@ ations relating to programmes or institutions for teacher education occurred in 1998 and 2005 .
in Germany , Spain , Austria and Finland , higher education institutions are also involved in the decision to proceed with external evaluation .
in Denmark , it can take place upon the request of various bodies .
in Denmark , programme evaluation may be conducted by E@@ va ( Danish E@@ valu@@ ation Institute ) on its own initiative and upon the request of , for example , the government , ministries , advisory boards , local authorities and establis@@ hments .
in Germany , external evaluation is carried out on the initiative of universities and teacher training centres , or the ministry of education in the case of teacher training institu@@ tes ( Stu@@ di@@ en@@ semin@@ are ) ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 4 , Sec@@ tion 4.@@ 1 ) .
for bac@@ hel@@ or '@@ s@@ - or master 's @@@ -@@ @ type programmes , there is a procedure for accredi@@ tation and re@@ accredi@@ tation .
the legislation of the different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der states that all external evaluation should be carried out regularly without specif@@ ying its frequ@@ ency .
in Spain , the AN@@ EC@@ A issues a call for applications , annually or every two years , from higher education institutions w@@ ishing to be evalu@@ ated .
the decision whether to submit to evaluation is taken by the head of the institution .
however , all institutions will have to be evalu@@ ated at least once by 2010 .
in Austria , external evaluation may be conducted at the request of the universities or the Ministry for Education , Science and Culture .
chapter 3 internal evaluation of initial teacher education
internal evaluation ( self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation ) of teacher education may B@@ E defined as an evaluation process for which those working in a particular institution or programme are responsible .
the process may cons@@ ist of the systematic collection of data and the questioning of students , lec@@ turers and other staff , and generally results in a final report .
internal evaluation offers opportunities for quality enhan@@ cement in so far as it is a collective app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of structures and practices existing within the institution concerned .
as already indicated in C@@ hap@@ ter 1 , regulations on internal evaluation exist in all countries and regions , except in Luxembourg .
in almost all countries , internal evaluation is comp@@ ul@@ sory .
it is recommended in Spain , France , Cyprus and Slovenia and is op@@ tional in Malta .
an over@@ view of the different kinds of internal evaluation in each country covered by this survey is provided in the an@@ ne@@ x .
more than one type of internal evaluation exists in the Czech Republic , Germany , Latvia , Hungary , Poland , Portugal , the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) and Iceland .
in most countries , Co@@ ordination is the responsibility of the management .
where this is not the case , an evaluation committee usually takes over this responsibility .
in Portugal , the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) and Bulgaria , all or almost all of the four bodies mentioned above take part in the Co@@ ordination of internal evaluation .
in the Czech Republic , Germany ( in the case of teacher training institu@@ tes ) , Poland , Slovenia and Iceland ( for the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions ) , the responsibility for Co@@ ordination lies mainly with the management of the institution .
in teacher training institu@@ tes ( Stu@@ di@@ en@@ semin@@ are ) in Germany , the main body responsible for co@@ ordinating internal evaluation is the management .
however , in some L@@ ä@@ n@@ der , it may also include administr@@ ators from the office of teacher training ( Am@@ t f@@ ür Leh@@ r@@ er@@ bil@@ d@@ ung ) or similar institutions in the L@@ ä@@ n@@ der , and staff from the teacher training institu@@ tes to be evalu@@ ated .
in universities in Poland , the teacher education faculty or chair of the university is responsible for internal evaluation .
the faculty council usually elec@@ ts a committee , which has to carry out evaluation and prepare a written report .
in teacher training col@@ leg@@ es , internal evaluation is carried out by the colle@@ ge council , while the management team is typically responsible for the evaluation of teaching .
in Slovenia , university rec@@ tors and de@@ ans are responsible for internal evaluation , according to the 2004 Hig@@ her Education Ac@@ t .
the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the internal evaluation process has to be managed by a specific commission appointed by the rec@@ tor / de@@ an .
in the regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions in Iceland , institutions are free to decide how to organise their quality assur@@ ance work .
however , the rec@@ tor be@@ ars the main responsibility .
in some institutions , there is a special quality manager , while in others quality issues are the responsibility of the governing board or a council .
in Denmark , the governing board is the sole body responsible for co@@ ordinating internal evaluation .
in Bulgaria , the evaluation committee presents its reports to the governing board of the institution .
the reports are then officially approved by the council of academic staff representatives which finally issues recommendations to the management .

these experts may either act on behalf of the principal or board of the institution , or simply give meth@@ od@@ ological / technical support to the staff responsible for conducting the evaluation .
in Italy , neither the management nor the academic staff takes part in evaluation .
in the Netherlands , the participation of the management is op@@ tional .
in nine countries , all or almost all of the five main players indicated in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.2 take part in internal evaluation .
the members of this committee may come from a wide range of back@@ grounds .
in Estonia , the members of the committee for the evaluation of study programmes are appointed by the fac@@ ul@@ ties or departments concerned .
it is strongly recommended that students should be included in its membership .
in Greece , the faculty 's evaluation group should cons@@ ist of teaching / research or educational staff holding the rank of professor or assistant professor , as well as a student representative .
it is recommended that committees should have a maximum of seven members .
in Hungary , the committee members are professors and researchers elected by the council of the institution for a period of three years .
the student self @@@ -@@ @ governing body may deleg@@ ate a representative to the committee , subject to the approval of the council .
in Iceland , the committee should comp@@ rise at least four and no more than six members drawn from faculty staff , students and administration .

Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place prior to external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
several countries state that other participants may contribute to internal evaluation , including the institution 's non @@@ -@@ @ academic staff , external stak@@ ehol@@ ders from the business sector or academic life elsewhere , and former gradu@@ ates of the institution .
in the French Community of Belgium , those who graduated from the institution in the three years prior to internal evaluation may participate .
in the F@@ le@@ mis@@ h Community of Belgium , the administrative and technical staff of the institution participate on a comp@@ ul@@ sory basis .
in Greece , the participation of the scientific and administrative staff is op@@ tional .
in Italy , the evaluation committee consists of academic and non @@@ -@@ @ academic experts chosen by the rec@@ tor .
the majority of its members are usually academ@@ ics , some of them from other universities .
in Spain and Portugal , administrative and service staff may participate in internal evaluation .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , it is comp@@ ul@@ sory for people external to the faculty or school offering the programme and for people from outside the institution to take part in the annual evaluation .
in Romania , it is recommended that representatives of the institution 's best gradu@@ ates and of employers should take part in the internal evaluation of P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical university col@@ leg@@ es and universities .
in several countries , although no official regulations exist , there may be practices defining who usually particip@@ ates in internal evaluation .
in Malta , for example , all academic staff members are encouraged to conduct an evaluation of their course programme by means of questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res or interviews with their students .
the respective depart@@ mental heads may also carry out their own independent evalu@@ ations .
external experts from abroad serving as moder@@ ators are invited to review both the course content and assessed as@@ sign@@ ments . they may also put forward recommendations for possible improvements .
although it is not officially regulated , management , academic staff and students are usually involved in internal evaluation in Austrian universities .
in Slovenia , the internal rules of all higher education institutions establish that the specific commission appointed by the de@@ an for managing the internal evaluation process should be composed of teachers , administr@@ ators and student representatives .
virtually all of the fore@@ going types of document are used to identify the criteria for internal evaluation in the French Community of Belgium , Greece , Lithuania and Poland .
almost all countries use legislation on higher education to establish the criteria of internal evaluation , always in con@@ jun@@ ction with several of the other documents referred to above .
in almost all cases , the use of such documents is comp@@ ul@@ sory , except in the French Community of Belgium and Romania , where their use is recommended .
several countries publish special documents , including a list of criteria for internal evaluation , to support higher education institutions in their task .
in Spain , the AN@@ EC@@ A publis@@ hes two main meth@@ od@@ ological resources to support universities in carrying out their institutional evaluation programme .
the second , the Gu@@ í@@ a de Aut@@ o@@ evalu@@ ac@@ i@@ ó@@ n ( self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation guide ) , is intended to facilitate the start of the sel@@ f@@ evaluation phase .
however , like all other higher education institutions , I@@ U@@ F@@ M@@ s will be increasingly expected in the first instance to carry out sel@@ f@@ evaluation using the Liv@@ re des R@@ é@@ f@@ é@@ ren@@ ces .
in Hungary , the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Committee provides guidelines for higher education institutions to prepare their annual institutional evaluation report and detailed gu@@ idance concerning the documents relating to self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation .
half of all countries also refer to the list of criteria used for external evaluation .
in Slovakia , the list of criteria developed by the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Committee for purposes of external evaluation and accredi@@ tation is very often used for the internal evaluation of study programmes in general .
while the use of the external evaluation criteria for annual evaluation is op@@ tional in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , intern@@ ally dev@@ ised criteria will generally not differ dramatically from them .
figure 3.3 : official documents to be used to establish criteria for the internal evaluation of initial teacher education for general education ( I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 ) , 2005 / 06
no regulations or no reference included in them
however , the internal evaluation of teacher education must refer to existing national qualification fra@@ me@@ works for programmes that provide it . these include regulations , content guidelines and qualification standards .
in the United Kingdom , although there are no specific regulations to this effect , the use of external evaluation results for internal evaluation is expected .
it is therefore taken for granted that inspection out@@ comes will be f@@ ed into self @@@ -@@ @ evaluation .
in the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the out@@ comes of the General Te@@ aching Council for Scot@@ land process will in turn fe@@ ed back into the internal quality assur@@ ance processes of the university .
however , there is no exp@@ li@@ cit mention of this having to happen - simply an expec@@ tation that it will , as it is such an obvious thing to do .
in Malta , however , regulations and content guidelines on initial teacher education as well as qualification standards for prospec@@ tive teachers are usually used for this purpose .
of the countries with official regulations on the scope of internal evaluation , most cover all ( or almost all ) of the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned issues .
Italy is the only country where the content of the teacher education curricul@@ um is not taken into account in regulations on internal evaluation .
some countries consider specific criteria other than those mentioned in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.4 , such as organis@@ ational issues or student @@@ -@@ @ focused social issues during internal evaluation .
in Greece , student welfare and the administrative services of the institution are also evalu@@ ated .
in Spain , both practices are en@@ countered .
the lack of regulations on the scope of internal evaluation in some countries does not imply that the issues actually covered differ greatly from the ones listed in F@@ ig@@ ure 3.4 .
in Denmark , the university governing board determin@@ es the focus of internal evaluation .
the questionnaire typically covers teaching methods , human resources management , student achievements and students " opinions on the education received and the balance between professional training and general education .
in Malta , almost all issues mentioned in the F@@ ig@@ ure are covered during the internal evaluation process .
there was also a focus on additional parame@@ ters , such as curricul@@ um development and international co@@ operation .
as well as the quality of teaching , other areas of interest were the organis@@ ational structure , administration , tasks of the department , research , the provision of services , public relations and the development plan .
in Slovenia , the student opinion surveys used for internal evaluation usually include questions about various aspects of the course content , the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the course work@@ load and the teachers ' and ass@@ ist@@ ants " ability to deliver the course .
the global reports established on this basis by the department and the faculty are used for ga@@ ug@@ ing how students ' perceptions v@@ ary over time or across discipl@@ ines , and for compar@@ ing student performance .
issues such as the re@@ lev@@ ance of student gender and the appropri@@ at@@ eness of the teaching meth@@ od@@ ology used are also addressed .

although , in the internal evaluation of universities , school pla@@ cements and partnerships with schools are not referred to directly , they are usually taken into account when preparing the sel@@ f@@ evaluation report .
Slovenia : University rec@@ tors and de@@ ans must assume responsibility for quality .
some of the issues shown in the table are therefore norm@@ ally the focus of internal evaluation .
the information provided rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
United Kingdom ( SC@@ T ) : the annual internal review process and matters to be considered ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally are li@@ able to cover similar ground .
Iceland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the internal evaluation of higher education programmes that takes place before external evaluation , and ( 2 ) to regular internal evaluation of higher education institutions .
a variety of procedures or mechanisms may be used for internal evaluation .
for example , interviews or surveys may focus on the management of an institution or on its academic and administrative staff or students .
class@@ room ob@@ servation of student teachers being ta@@ ught may be another way of collecting the information required for internal evaluation .
in most countries , all three types of interview mentioned above are used on a comp@@ ul@@ sory basis or are recommended .
in Belgium , Germany , Estonia , Spain and Bulgaria , they are used together with class@@ room ob@@ servation .
student interviews or surveys are the most widely used means of carrying out internal evaluation .
in Italy , Latvia ( in the ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation of study programmes ) and Slovakia , they are the only comp@@ ul@@ sory procedure .
in Poland ( in the case of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es ) and Romania , interviews or surveys of students are not fore@@ seen .
where internal evaluation ref@@ ers to the ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation of a study programme in Latvia , employers of former gradu@@ ates are inter@@ viewed as well as students .
in Slovakia , students are obliged to complete questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res annually , focusing mainly on their satisfaction with teaching and learning .
in 13 countries and regions , there are no official regulations which lay down procedures and mechanisms for internal evaluation .
however , certain practices may exist .
in Denmark , internal evaluation is very often carried out as a written evaluation .
in Malta , all academic staff must develop a work forecast for every academic year , which is then discussed with the depart@@ mental head .
each teacher 's performance is also app@@ raised through a formal discussion .
in Slovenia , according to the internal rules of higher education institutions , student opinion surveys are used for the internal evaluation process .
in the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) , internal evaluation is expected but is not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly required .
its form@@ at is not pres@@ cri@@ bed .
however , the inspec@@ torate ( O@@ f@@ s@@ ted ) can@@ not insist that a sel@@ f@@ evaluation should be completed .

frequ@@ ency
in 13 countries , internal evaluation should occur on an annual basis .
in Bulgaria , it has to be carried out several times a year .
in ten countries or regions , higher education institutions have to undertake internal evaluation at fixed inter@@ vals of longer periods ranging from three to ten years .
in most of these countries , the timing depends on that of external evaluation .
this may mean that both types of evaluation must take place during the same academic year and amount to a single process .
Alternati@@ vely , it may mean that an internal evaluation must take place between two external evalu@@ ations , but not necessarily in the same year as an external evaluation . in Ireland , on the other hand , the timing of external evaluation is dependent on that of internal evaluation .
in Ireland , internal evaluation , which has to be carried out every ten years , results in external evaluation of the quality assur@@ ance procedures adopted by higher education institutions .
in Austria , both situations ( external evaluation calling for internal evaluation and vice ver@@ sa ) may exist .
in Hungary , inter@@ mediate reports are additionally required every four years .
in all countries with procedures for accredi@@ ting programmes or institutions ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 4.@@ 1 ) , initial accredi@@ tation generally involves an internal evaluation .
in the nine countries or regions in which the frequ@@ ency of internal evaluation is not determined by regulations , different scenarios are possible .
in the French Community of Belgium , France and Iceland , the body responsible for external evaluation decides when it should occur .
in Spain and Finland , higher education institutions are also involved in the decision to proceed with external evaluation ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 , Sec@@ tion 2.5 ) .
in Finland , the institutions must also conduct an internal evaluation independent of external evaluation , and determine its frequ@@ ency .

chapter 4 use made of evaluation findings
the results of evaluation may be used in different ways , with direct or indirect repercussions for institutions or programmes .
inadequate quality may , for example , mean that institutions have to draw up and implement a plan for improvement consisting of various measures , which may be subject to follow@@ up evaluation .
penalties are also possible , as when an institution is no longer granted the right to award qualifications , or when its funding is ad@@ jus@@ ted .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , high @@@ -@@ @ standard performance may lead to an increase in funding .
over and above their consequences for institutions , the results of evaluation may also be made available to their staff , students and the general public .
finally , evaluation findings from all institutions may be col@@ lated and sum@@ mar@@ ised in national reports concerned with the quality of initial teacher education as a whole .
the following aspects are dealt with in this chapter : the possible consequences of evaluation for institutions or programmes ; the avail@@ ability of evaluation findings for their staff , students and the general public ; the use of evaluation findings to prepare indicators or national reports on the state of the teacher education system as a whole .
in just five countries or regions ( the French Community of Belgium , Denmark , Ireland , Austria and Finland ) , these aspects der@@ ive only margin@@ ally from regulations - if at all .
in the French Community of Belgium , the purpose of external evaluation is essentially to point the way forward for individual institutions .
it is intended that they should - entirely on their own initiative - introduce a procedure for reform inspired by the findings of external evaluation ( which remain confi@@ dential ) .
however , in the end it is the government of the Community which decides on the possible consequences of external evaluation .
in Ireland and Finland , the use made of the external evaluation results is the responsibility of the institution evalu@@ ated .
in Finland , the external evaluation body ( FI@@ N@@ H@@ E@@ EC ) usually under@@ takes a follow@@ up evaluation after three years .

consequences of external evaluation : impact on ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation Im@@ pact on funding
chapter 4 - U@@ se made of E@@ valu@@ ation findings
in the majority of countries , the findings of external evaluation provide the basis for a decision regarding the ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation of institutions or programmes .
this means determining whether or not an institution may be officially recognised as satis@@ fying the conditions required by accredi@@ tation standards .
the evaluation results are therefore used to take a major decision regarding institutions and their enti@@ t@@ lement to provide teacher education and award the correspon@@ ding qualifications , and to obtain public funding .
the@@ ore@@ tically , if the results are poor , a programme may be dis@@ continued or an institution closed .
in Lithuania , evalu@@ ations conducted by the centre for quality assessment in higher education are ge@@ ar@@ ed as a priority to enhancing quality , but their results also fe@@ ed into a ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation process .
in the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) , one of the purposes of inspection is to check compliance with requirements .
in Norway , the agency for quality assur@@ ance in education evalu@@ ates all higher education institutions on a regular basis .
if the results are not satisfactory , the institution concerned may continue to offer its existing programmes but may not introduce any new ones until it has improved its performance .
the findings of external evaluation may also provide a basis for initi@@ ating a possible re@@ accredi@@ tation procedure .
to date , programmes for teacher education have not been the subject of such a procedure .
when a programme is concerned , funding is generally re@@ organised within the institution concerned , and its amount may remain stable .
however , in Spain and Sweden , the accredi@@ tation procedure can@@ not affect funding in any way .
the level of funding may also v@@ ary in accordance with the level of quality observed during external evaluation , as for example in the case of the United Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) .
in the event of un@@ favourable evaluation in the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium , the institution concerned may have to repay the public funding awarded to it for operational purposes .
the teacher education institutions in France ( In@@ stitu@@ ts uni@@ vers@@ it@@ ai@@ res de form@@ ations des ma@@ î@@ t@@ res - I@@ U@@ F@@ M@@ s ) are evalu@@ ated by various bodies ( see the an@@ ne@@ x ) .
the results of these evalu@@ ations are taken into account notably during negotiations to ren@@ ew the four @@@ -@@ @ year public funding contract .
in Portugal , positive findings may be an incentive to introduce new programmes or develop already existing ones .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , in the case of poor results , programmes may be suspended .
however , in practice , such situations have not yet been en@@ countered .
this generally involves an obligation on the part of the institution to draw up a plan for improvement and fresh external evaluation after a given period of time , which var@@ ies from one country to the next .
in Germany and France , the follow@@ up is op@@ tional .
in Greece and Iceland , the sole consequence of external evaluation for institutions is the implementation of a plan for improvement .
in most countries where the results of external evaluation are used to inform ( re@@ - ) accredi@@ tation decisions , conditional or temporary accredi@@ tation may be awarded in the case of non @@@ -@@ @ compliance with accredi@@ tation requirements .
this conditional accredi@@ tation is usually delivered for two or three years , and a follow@@ up is organised in the meantime .
in the Czech Republic , if the accredi@@ tation awarded to study programmes is subject to certain conditions , the faculty has to submit ( generally within two years ) a report on the fulfil@@ ment of imposed conditions .
in Latvia , a study programme may receive temporary accredi@@ tation ( for two years ) only once .
as regards internal evaluation , regulations allow for the formu@@ lation of a plan for improvement in most countries .
a plan of this kind is recommended in the French Community of Belgium , Germany , Estonia , Slovakia and Romania , and is op@@ tional in Italy .
in around ten countries , institutions practi@@ se internal evaluation for which no regulations concerning a plan for improvement are issued .
this is due to the autonomy of institutions .
in France , Cyprus , Slovenia and Iceland , this internal evaluation is recommended and / or only spar@@ ingly regulated .
in Germany , external evaluation is not comp@@ ul@@ sory .
regulations on the publication of individual external evaluation results for each institution or programme are very common .
in 19 countries , these results are published system@@ atically .
however , systematic publication of internal evaluation results is only required in six countries ( the Czech Republic for annual internal evaluation , Italy , Lithuania , Slovakia , Finland and Sweden ) .
in Spain and Latvia , the publication of the results of external and internal evalu@@ ations is op@@ tional .
in Spain , the institution evalu@@ ated decides whether the results are to be published .
in Slovenia and the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) , the findings of external evaluation are not published as such , but they are available to the public indirectly .
in Slovenia , working meetings of the body responsible for external evaluation , the Council for Hig@@ her Education , are public .
information is circ@@ ulated via the press .
in Norway , publication of the findings of internal evaluation is recommended , whereas in Germany , Greece , Hungary and the United Kingdom ( Scot@@ land ) it is op@@ tional .
in the majority of countries , there are no regulations or recommendations on the publication of internal evaluation results .
however , it may nevertheless be common to publish these results .
in Ireland , internal and external evaluation reports are published on university websites .
this may also be the case in Spain .
in Germany , Hungary , the Netherlands , Iceland , Norway and Romania , the results of external evaluation are also published in bro@@ ch@@ ures on education , con@@ gres@@ ses , press articles , et@@ c .
the publication of evaluation findings means that they are available de facto to all those involved in the functioning of higher education .
in the French Community of Belgium and Poland ( teacher training col@@ leg@@ es ) , there are very few regulations on the publication of results and their acces@@ sibility within the institutions .
only management has systematic access to results .
in Austria , the publication of external and internal evaluation results is not subject to any regulations , which may be due to a lack of regulations on evaluation in general .
in practice in this country , evaluation results are usually made available to the stak@@ ehol@@ ders .

Malta : internal evaluation results are usually made available to academic staff and students .
Poland : ( 1 ) rela@@ tes to the external evaluation of universities , and ( 2 ) to external evaluation of teacher training col@@ leg@@ es .

they are also published in reports produced by the national higher education quality assessment commission .
United Kingdom : the information rela@@ tes solely to the evaluation of initial teacher education and not to the evaluation of higher education in general .
schools working in partnership with the institutions evalu@@ ated may access the findings of external evaluation in the majority of countries .
in 11 countries , the results have to be available to academic staff and students .
in Estonia and Romania this practice is also recommended .
monitoring of the education system pursu@@ es several aims .
it is intended to help control the system , provide reports on its quality and enable adjustments to enhance its performance .
it imp@@ lies the need for comprehensive information on the system as a whole .
however , the preparation of national reports and indicators based on the evaluation reports of individual institutions is far from general practice .

for general secondary education , teacher education is provided outside the Community . most teachers are trained in the French Community of Belgium .
Germany : only the results of external evalu@@ ations to ( re@@ - ) acc@@ re@@ dit bac@@ hel@@ or 's and master 's programmes ( which are being introduced in 12 of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) are the subject of national reports and indicators .
chapter 5 accredi@@ tation and evaluation of I@@ N @@@ -@@ @ service teacher education
professional development for teachers may have various aims and address a variety of needs , from nation@@ ally identified educational priorities to the particular needs of schools or individual teachers .
in several countries , the design of in@@ service education programmes has become completely decentral@@ ised and is the responsibility of schools .
as a consequence , schools and local education authorities offer training based on the skills and development needs of teachers and schools .
in the great majority of countries , all or almost all types of provider currently exist , except for some countries with only one or two providers , as illu@@ strated in the examples below .
in Greece and Cyprus , public authority in@@ service teacher education centres are the only bodies offering provision .
in Norway , higher education institutions are the sole providers of in@@ service teacher education .

these two projects are currently being implemented .
Lithuania : draft regulations on the evaluation of in@@ service teacher education are in the final phase of legal approval .
their approval and a first evaluation are planned for 2006 . Iceland : evaluation of higher education institutions providing in@@ service teacher education has not yet been carried out .
chapter 5 - Ac@@ credi@@ tation and E@@ valu@@ ation of In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Education
this means that in@@ service teacher education under@@ goes the same quality assessment as higher education .
in these two countries , regulations on both accredi@@ tation and evaluation apply for certain providers only , whereas for other providers , regulations on only one of the two procedures apply .
the situation is similar in Italy , where regulations on accredi@@ tation do not apply to higher education institutions or to institutions for initial teacher education .
the contents of the course have to be relevant to the objectives and strategies of the institutions and the initial education of the participants .
although no regulations exist in Cyprus , evaluation of in@@ service education programmes is conducted by the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical Institute of the Ministry of Education and Culture .
in Malta , organisers are encouraged to review their courses by asking participants to fill in questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res .
in Austria , the P@@ ä@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ is@@ chen Institute ( institutions for in@@ service teacher education ) publish an annual report on their provision .
furthermore , in England , the Tra@@ ining and Development Agency for Scho@@ ols has an extended re@@ mit covering in@@ service education for teachers .
in Spain , depending on the legislation of the Aut@@ onomous Community concerned , the evaluation of in@@ service teacher education providers consists of different elements .
those referred to as " comp@@ ul@@ sory " in F@@ ig@@ ure 5.2 are common to all Aut@@ onomous Commun@@ ities , whereas those termed " op@@ tional " reflect the situation of just some of them .

Lithuania : the draft regulations include almost all procedures on a comp@@ ul@@ sory basis . Slovenia : data refer to accredi@@ tation only .
concerning external evaluation , the main procedures in the other countries are the analysis of a written plan and site visits .
almost all countries with official regulations , except Denmark , Sweden , Iceland and Norway , analy@@ se a written plan .
it is recommended in the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium and Slovakia and is op@@ tional in Slovenia .
responsibility may lie with an evaluation agency or committee , the ministry of education , an independent body ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . an au@@ dit agency ) working on behalf of the public authority , an inspec@@ torate specifically established for school education or in@@ service teacher education , external evaluation experts or other bodies depending on the particular country .
in line with the decentral@@ ised structure of Germany and Spain , the bodies undertaking accredi@@ tation and / or evaluation in these two countries may differ from one Land or Aut@@ onomous Community to the next .
given the principle of cultural sovereignty in Germany , the general supervision of in@@ service teacher education is the task of the ministries in each of the 16 L@@ ä@@ n@@ der .
as regards evaluation and accredi@@ tation of the workshops , courses and programmes offered by the various providers , many L@@ ä@@ n@@ der have established or appointed central institu@@ tes or agencies for this task .
as an independent body , the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Council ( Ak@@ kredi@@ ti@@ er@@ un@@ g@@ s@@ r@@ at ) also takes part in accredi@@ tation and evaluation .

in Poland , depending on the course evalu@@ ated , two different bodies carry out evaluation .
the ministry of education evalu@@ ates and accredi@@ ts in@@ service teacher education courses offered by the National Centre of In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining .
it also decides whether to recognise qualification courses for practi@@ sing teachers which are offered by institutions for initial teacher education during after@@ no@@ ons , week@@ ends or summer .
the heads of regional education authorities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) , which are subordin@@ ate to the ministry , evaluate and acc@@ re@@ dit qualification courses offered by all other providers .
in Denmark , either the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Science , Technology and Innov@@ ation carry out accredi@@ tation .
they are supported by a team of statisti@@ cians spec@@ ially engaged by the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical Institute for this purpose .
in the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium and Ireland , the inspec@@ torate is part of the ministry of education .
an inspec@@ torate for in@@ service teacher education exists only in Hungary ( the National Committee for In @@@ -@@ @ Service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining ) , where it particip@@ ates in evaluation along with other bodies .

in the majority of them , the content of the activity as well as the teaching methods and / or the compet@@ ences of the tra@@ in@@ ers are taken into account .
infrastructure ( such as teaching material , technical equipment ) is also quite often evalu@@ ated . participants " opinions on the training they receive are considered in eight countries .
the German @@@ -@@ @ speaking Community of Belgium , Iceland and Bulgaria apply the same regulations to the scope of the evaluation and / or accredi@@ tation of in@@ service teacher education and to the evaluation of initial teacher education .
these regulations take all aspects mentioned into account .
several countries mention a variety of other aspects .
consist@@ ency between content and organisation of the activity and the educational aims seems to be one of the most important aspects .
in Ireland , evaluation also focuses on the re@@ lev@@ ance of the course to the primary school curricul@@ um and the extent to which the activity comp@@ lies with official policy and guidelines .
the detailed content requirements are compared with the goals of the respective training programme and with the data given by the programme organis@@ er .
moreover , evaluation analy@@ ses whether the programme emphasises successful learning and how the issues presented can be put into practice .
the provider is responsible for the quality of implementation , programme objectives , tasks and planned results .

in Greece , external evaluation takes place once a year at the end of the programme , while internal evaluation takes place three times a year , at the end of each phase of the programme ( three phases in total ) .
in Hungary , new programmes can be accredi@@ ted every year or wh@@ en@@ ever applications are made .
programme providers can decide to start in@@ service education programmes any@@ time .
however , the accredi@@ tation procedure co@@ ordinated by the In@@ service Te@@ acher Tra@@ ining Ac@@ credi@@ ting B@@ ody is the condition for starting a programme .
programmes are then accredi@@ ted for five years . if providers want to continue their programmes after the fifth year , they must go through the accredi@@ tation procedure again .
programme providers are also required to carry out sel@@ f@@ evaluation procedures .
furthermore , the Sul@@ i@@ Nova K@@ ht ( a non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisation ) monitors in@@ service teacher education programmes by means of a sel@@ f@@ evaluation questionnaire .
in Poland , the ministry of education supervis@@ es and approves the National Centre of In@@ service Tra@@ ining activity report for the previous year and plan for the following year .
every year , the Regional Educ@@ ational Auth@@ orities ( kur@@ ator@@ ia ) provide the ministry with the conclusions concerning the performance of in@@ service teacher education institutions in their respective region . another obligation of the R@@ EA
in Slovenia , according to regulations which have been in place since the 2004 / 05 school year , only part of in@@ service courses are accredi@@ ted each year .
in 2005 , for instance , the programme council decided to review the cl@@ us@@ ter of ref@@ res@@ her courses and courses for the professional development of teachers .
in 2006 , courses on whole @@@ -@@ @ school issues will be the focus of evaluation .
the results of the accredi@@ tation and evaluation of in@@ service education may be used in different ways , with repercussions for institutions or programmes , similar to the evaluation of initial teacher education ( C@@ hap@@ ter 4 ) .
in the Czech Republic , accredi@@ tation is awarded by the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports on recommendation of the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Commission .
the Ministry has the right to control the accredi@@ ted programmes during the period of accredi@@ tation ( three years ) , but so far no rules on the procedures have been prepared .
in the event that the provider does not fulfil the programme , the accredi@@ tation can be withdrawn .
the main@@ tain@@ er of a school may check if in@@ service programmes for teachers correspon@@ d to the P@@ ed@@ ag@@ og@@ ical programme of the school .
in Latvia , the commission has the right to withdraw approval given to a programme if there is proof that it has failed to meet requirements .
in Poland , negative evaluation findings can result in the accredi@@ tation for a given institution to be withdrawn and the financial means planned for in@@ service courses to be chann@@ elled into other training institutions .
in Portugal , there is an initial accredi@@ tation process for the institution or programme .
this accredi@@ tation may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn if there is proof of irregularities .
in Slovenia , the main aim of an accredi@@ tation procedure is for formal programme offers to be selected following a public tender .
evaluation findings are generally also used for improvement of provision .
in Cyprus , although no regulations exist , evaluation findings are used for decision @@@ -@@ @ making with respect to the goals , processes and instruc@@ tors of the programmes .
evaluation and accredi@@ tation results may also be provided as information to various players involved in the planning of in@@ service teacher education activities .
in the Netherlands , accredi@@ tation results are published on the website of the N@@ eder@@ lands @@@ -@@ @ Vla@@ am@@ se Ac@@ credi@@ tati@@ e Organ@@ is@@ ati@@ e ( N@@ V@@ AO , or Ac@@ credi@@ tation Organisation of The Netherlands and F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
these reports are then sent to the Council for Program@@ mes of Contin@@ u@@ ing Education and Tra@@ ining of Profes@@ sional Staff of Scho@@ ols and kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens .
on the basis of these reports , an overall national report is prepared and is discussed and assessed by the Council before being sent to the minister of education .
in Romania , accredi@@ ted teacher training programmes are published in a list used by teachers for the selection of the in@@ service training course that they must attend every five years .
chapter 6 reforms and debate
first , institutions or programmes for initial teacher education are in general part of higher education and are therefore also
these reforms have been referred to in previous chapters .
the debates and reforms described below are concerned with two main questions which rela@@ te directly to teacher education .
many countries have begun reforms of the organisation of initial teacher education and in@@ service training sometimes in relation to the Bologna process , or are inten@@ ding to do so .
the situation in some of these countries , which have planned to adap@@ t procedures for evalu@@ ating teacher education , is the subject of the first section .
a limited number of countries are currently engaged in debates concerned with the quality of evaluation procedures in teacher education . such debates are described in the second section .
this last trend is becoming increasingly more widespread in Europe .
the introduction of the two @@@ -@@ @ cycle ( bac@@ hel@@ or / master ) structure in several L@@ ä@@ n@@ der in Germany has rapidly demonstrated how important it is that they should mutually recognise qualifications obtained by teachers within this new structure .
later , it was established in a resolution passed in April 2005 that , in order to be granted this recognition , courses had to be struc@@ tured in mo@@ du@@ les , accredi@@ ted and therefore evalu@@ ated be@@ fore@@ hand .
the previous system of evaluation sought to ensure that the regulations were comp@@ lied with .
ongoing debate on the evaluation of initial and in@@ service education is exam@@ ining how far evaluation of this kind should become general practice and whether it achiev@@ es its aims .
later stages of the plan are concerned in particular with developing the aspects detailed in it , including professional standards , the skills of teachers and comp@@ ul@@ sory requirements as regards teacher education programmes .
in Italy , the system of initial teacher education is undergoing reform . a decree on the defin@@ ition of general standards of training providing access to the profession has been approved by the government .
the decree includes defin@@ itions of the criteria and procedures for monitoring and evalu@@ ating the outcome of teacher education provided as part of the master programme .
the decree is not yet implemented , as further decisions are still required concerning the curricul@@ um and recru@@ it@@ ment procedures to be connected with initial education .
in Latvia , improvements in the system of in@@ service teacher education , which are currently being discussed , are expected to involve the evaluation of providers and not just programmes .
in the case of quality assur@@ ance , recommendations should be submitted to the Wel@@ sh Assembly Government by January 2007 .

Kur@@ ator@@ ia ( Regional Educ@@ ational Auth@@ orities )
con@@ current model : an initial teacher education programme which , from the out@@ set , combin@@ es general teacher education in one or more subjects with the@@ ore@@ tical and practical professional teacher training .
consecutive model : a two @@@ -@@ @ stage initial teacher education programme .
students first receive general education in order to obtain a degree in a particular subject or branch of study .
at or near the end of this period of study , they en@@ rol in a programme of initial professional training , enabling them to qualify as teachers .
evaluation : the general process of a systematic and critical analysis leading to judg@@ ments and / or recommendations for improvement regarding the quality of a ( teacher ) education institution or programme .
Syn@@ ony@@ ms : assessment , au@@ dit , pe@@ er review , quality assessment , review .
evaluation criteria : check@@ points by which the at@@ tain@@ ment of certain objectives and / or standards can be examined .
they describe the character@@ isti@@ cs of the requirements and conditions to be met , and therefore provide the ( quanti@@ t@@ ative and / or qual@@ it@@ ative ) basis on which an evalu@@ ative conclusion is drawn .
expert in evaluation : a person experienced and qualified in the evaluation of institutions and / or its staff .
S / he may have various professional back@@ grounds , for example in research , teaching or management positions .
external evaluation : the process where@@ by a specialised external body collec@@ ts data , information and evidence about an institution or a programme , in order to make a statement about its quality .
external evaluation is norm@@ ally carried out by a team of external experts , pe@@ ers or inspectors . Syn@@ ony@@ m : external review .
General teacher education : General courses and mas@@ tery of the subject ( s ) that tra@@ ine@@ es will te@@ ach when qualified .
the purpose of these courses , therefore , is to provide tra@@ ine@@ es with a thorough knowledge of one or more subjects and good general knowledge .
inspec@@ tor : a person evalu@@ ating the quality of educational provisions who works within the body of an educational authority .
S / he may be trained as a teacher and / or have an administrative background .
internal evaluation : a process carried out under the responsibility of those working within an institution , consisting of the systematic collection of administrative data and the questioning of students , lec@@ turers and other staff .
it may be considered as a collective institutional ref@@ le@@ ction and an opportunity for quality enhan@@ cement .
pe@@ er : academic of the same higher education discipline , specialist in the field reviewed .
works outside of the institution / programmes evalu@@ ated .
professional teacher training : part of the initial teacher education programme which provides future teachers with both the@@ ore@@ tical and practical in@@ sight into their future profession .
qualification standards : a set of core competencies , relevant knowledge and skills within a study programme , i@@ .@@ e@@ . everything a future teacher should know and be able to do .
this level of requirements must be at@@ tained by student teachers in order to obtain a teaching qualification .
qualification standards shape what goes into the curricul@@ um of the teacher education programme and may be defined within the framework of official guidelines for initial teacher education .
recommendation : non @@@ -@@ @ stat@@ ut@@ ory guidelines which are of an advisory nature , issued by the top @@@ -@@ @ level education authorities .
regulation : a law , decree or any other officially binding document , issued by the top @@@ -@@ @ level education authorities .
site visit : a component of external evaluation .
standards : statements regarding an expected level of requirements and conditions against which quality is assessed , or which must be at@@ tained by institutions or students in order for them to be accredi@@ ted or certi@@ fied .

I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 1 : primary education
this level begins between 5 and 7 years of age , is comp@@ ul@@ sory in all countries and generally lasts from four to six years .
I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 2 : lower secondary education
it continues the basic programmes of the primary level , although teaching is typically more subject @@@ -@@ @ focused .
usually , the end of this level coinci@@ des with the end of comp@@ ul@@ sory education .
in some countries comp@@ ul@@ sory education is provided in a single structure without a transition between the primary and lower secondary levels .
I@@ SC@@ E@@ D 3 : up@@ per secondary education
this level generally begins at the end of comp@@ ul@@ sory education .
the entrance age is typically 15 or 16 years .
entrance qualifications ( end of comp@@ ul@@ sory education ) and other minimum entry requirements are usually needed .
in@@ struction is often more subject @@@ -@@ @ oriented than at I@@ SC@@ E@@ D level 2 .
the typical dur@@ ation of I@@ SC@@ E@@ D level 3 var@@ ies from two to five years .

every education system and national education policy uses its own specific termin@@ ology to describe the character@@ isti@@ cs of its organisation and operation .
in trying to understand and make reliable compar@@ is@@ ons of how the various education systems in Europe really work , we are often confron@@ ted with questions of termin@@ ology .
for these reasons , the Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce Network in 1999 launched a series entitled the European g@@ los@@ s@@ ary on Education .
Turkey which is also a member of the Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce Network did not contribute to this g@@ los@@ s@@ ary .
the present volume belongs to a set of public@@ ations that Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce is producing in 2007 to provide greater in@@ sight into inter@@ related aspects of higher education .
a guide to the use of the g@@ los@@ s@@ ary is presented by way of introduction .
it contains all relevant defin@@ itions and outlines the different aspects covered in the explan@@ atory note on each term .
this fifth volume is the result of very close co@@ operation between the Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce National Un@@ its and the Eur@@ y@@ di@@ ce European Unit ( E@@ EU ) .

what does the future hold for the European Economic and Social Committee ?
the N@@ ice Treaty defin@@ es the Committee as the institutional bo@@ dy@@ responsible for representing civil society organisations .
- presentation of investigative reports on topics chosen in close co@@ operation with@@ the interest groups concerned ;
- preparation of opinions on the Commission 's annual or half @@@ -@@ @ ye@@ arly reports on th@@ es@@ ing@@ le market economic reform ( Car@@ di@@ ff process ) ; and
what are the E@@ E@@ SC 's current priority objectives ?
over and above its consul@@ t@@ ative role , the Committee is working to set up a model of@@ particip@@ atory democracy throughout Europe and the rest of the world .
it contribu@@ tes@@ to the development of soci@@ o@@ economic organisations in civil society , including in@@ countries applying to join the EU .
through the Convention , it fully particip@@ ates in the@@ debate on the future of Europe and preparations for the next IG@@ C .
the Committee 's work programme is based on the European Commission 's work programme , the priorities of@@ each Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the work programme presented by each Committee president upon election .
what are the links between the European Economic and Social Committee and the national economic and social coun@@ cil@@ san@@ do@@ ther similar bodies ?
the E@@ E@@ SC has developed close co@@ operation with economic and social coun@@ cils and@@ similar institutions .
it also particip@@ ates actively in the work of the International Association of Econom@@ ic@@ and Social Coun@@ cils and Sim@@ il@@ ar In@@ stitu@@ tions ( IA@@ ESC@@ SI ) , the members of which sp@@ an@@ 50 countries .
l@@ ast@@ ly , the E@@ E@@ SC maintains regular relations with civil society organisations in the countries applying for EU membership and in several countries or country group@@ ings outside the European Union .
these activities are carried out jointly with the econom@@ ic@@ and social coun@@ cils in the M@@ ember States comp@@ rising such organisations .
how are E@@ E@@ SC members appointed ?
what added value does the E@@ E@@ SC bring ?
the E@@ E@@ SC 's contribution to European integration is thre@@ ef@@ old :
the European Economic and Social Committee is a consul@@ t@@ ative body set up by the Rome treaties in 19@@ 57 .
these men@@ and women work actively " in the field " in the economic and social life of their country .
this pool of expertise is backed up by specific working methods , such as the@@ use of study groups , experts and hearings ;
- secondly , the Committee is a place for studying issues and ham@@ mer@@ ing out solutions based on compromise , even where the initial stances are di@@ verg@@ ent or even@@ di@@ ame@@ tri@@ cally opposite ;
how does the E@@ E@@ SC operate ?
the Committee adopts on average 150 opinions a year on a wide range of subjects concerning European integration .
it therefore plays an active role in the Community decis@@ ion@@ making process .
- finally , its members " professional orig@@ ins mean that the Committee is a fo@@ cal poin@@ t@@ for the questions and aspirations of civil society organisations regarding all aspec@@ ts@@ of European integration .
the Committee comp@@ rises six specialist sections covering a very wide range of Community sp@@ her@@ es of responsibility :
the Committee holds struc@@ tu@@ red@@ dialogue with representatives of civil society organisations in these countries and@@ regions , and promotes the creation of consul@@ t@@ ative structures based on its own model .
through the role assigned to it by the treaties , and thanks to its broad member@@ ship@@ and their expertise , the E@@ E@@ SC constitu@@ tes a valuable forum for representing and@@ in@@ forming civil society organisations and expressing their views .
it speaks on be@@ hal@@ f@@ of these organisations to the European institutions and in doing so acts as a uni@@ qu@@ eb@@ ri@@ dge between Europe and its people .
in addition , following exp@@ iry of the EC@@ SC Treaty in July 2002 and on a proposal by@@ the European Commission , the Committee was asked to assume the respon@@ sibil@@ iti@@ es@@ of the EC@@ SC 's Con@@ sul@@ t@@ ative Committee .
this composition will be gradually extended to include other sectors affected by problems caused by the modernisation of the economy , and to all the interested parties concerned .
hence the C@@ C@@ IC '@@ s@@ re@@ mit is not limited to the coal and steel sectors alone , but also takes account of al@@ las@@ pec@@ ts of industrial change .
what is the impact of the E@@ E@@ SC 's work ?
the size of these study groups var@@ ies from 3 to 15 members , depending on the importance of the subject . rap@@ por@@ te@@ urs can also call on external exper@@ ts@@ to assist them .
the last E@@ E@@ SC renewal - which covers the next four @@@ -@@ @ year period - took place in October 2002 .
a total of 40 % of members were newly appointed .
the Committee Sec@@ re@@ tariat will be headed by M@@ r Patrick Ven@@ tur@@ ini , Secretary @@@ -@@ @ General .

the Treaty also requires that the Court of Au@@ di@@ tors be requested to give a formal opin@@ ion@@ on each proposal to@@ introduce or amend legislation with a financial impact , including the fight against fraud .
other European Uni@@ on@@ institutions may also request the Court to give its formal opinion on specific matters .
au@@ dit approach
in line with other public au@@ dit institutions , the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors under@@ takes two different types of au@@ dit , name@@ ly financial audi@@ t@@ and sound financial management au@@ dit .
reli@@ ability of the accounts : are the financial statements complete and accur@@ ate ?
in general , these comp@@ rise a balance she@@ et , an@@ economic out@@ turn account , a cash @@@ -@@ @ flow table , a statement of changes in capital and explan@@ atory notes .
legality and regular@@ ity : has the income been collected and expendi@@ ture inc@@ urred in con@@ form@@ ity with all rele@@ van@@ tru@@ les and regulations ?
the treaties and the Financial Regula@@ tion require the Court to au@@ dit the legality and regular@@ ity of the transactions by@@ which the EU finances and imple@@ ments its budget .
the objec@@ tiv@@ e@@ is to ensure that transactions have been executed in accordance with the rele@@ van@@ tru@@ les andre@@ gula@@ tions , that they exist in reality , have been correc@@ tly calculated and that the benefic@@ i@@ aries of EU aid hav@@ eful@@ filled their obligations .
the au@@ dit covers all aspects from rece@@ ip@@ t or payment by the Commission throug@@ h@@ different levels of administration down to individual elements of EU revenue or rece@@ ip@@ t by the final benefic@@ i@@ ary .
the D@@ AS is based on the results of detailed financi@@ al@@ audi@@ ts .
the specific app@@ ra@@ is@@ als are based on the following :
assessment of the functioning of the internal control systems ( particularly the supervis@@ ory systems ) both at the Commission and in M@@ ember and benefic@@ i@@ ary States ; Au@@ dit evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based on the testing of a samp@@ le of transactions from each budgetary field ; evidence ar@@ ising from the audi@@ ts of EU finances carried out by other audi@@ tors ; and Ex@@ am@@ ination of the annual activity reports and declar@@ ation@@ s@@ issued by the Direc@@ tors @@@ -@@ @ General of the European Commission .
the D@@ AS specific app@@ ra@@ is@@ als include monitoring ele@@ ment@@ sin order to provide an objective assessment of the quality off@@ inan@@ cial management and to allow the monitoring of progress over time .
the D@@ AS statement , with accompan@@ ying information , is published in the Court 's Ann@@ ual Report , which the Cour@@ t@@ deli@@ vers to the European Parliament and Council .
the statement is also published with the financial statements of the European Union in the Official Journal .
similar opinions are provided on the financial statements of the European Union 's agencies and bodies .
sound financial management au@@ dit
value for money : have the funds been managed in an economic , efficient and effective manner , provi@@ d@@ ing@@ value for money for the citizens of the Union ?
according to the Financial Regula@@ tion , EU funds should be managed based on the principles of : economy
for a given output or objective , the minimum amount of funds have been used .
best value has been obtained for the money spent .
the objectives of the EU policy have been met .
the Court , in common with other public au@@ dit bodies , has two different approaches to sound financial manag@@ em@@ ent@@ audi@@ ts , depending on the topic under au@@ dit and the risks involved .
the first approach is to evaluate the management of the expendi@@ ture , and particularly the measures taken to achiev@@ ev@@ al@@ ue for money .
this involves making an evaluation of the approach taken by management and the systems us@@ ed@@ for ensuring value for money and testing the decisions taken .
the au@@ dit concludes on whether the approach tak@@ en@@ by management was likely to ensure value for money , and if not , how it could be improved .
the second approach comp@@ rises an assessment of whether a given programme or project met its objectives and achiev@@ ed@@ value for money .
this involves an exam@@ ination of whether , and how , the objectives of the specific expendi@@ ture w@@ er@@ e@@ achiev@@ ed@@ and an assessment of whether the minimum resources were used for that outcome .
the au@@ dit concludes on@@ whether value for money was achieved for the programme , and if not , how it could be improved .
General au@@ dit objectives
Com@@ ple@@ ten@@ ess all assets and li@@ abilities ( including off @@@ -@@ @ balance she@@ et items ) proper to the period are entered in the accounting records
financial au@@ dit -@@ reli@@ ability of the@@ accounts
valu@@ ation the asset or li@@ ability is entered into the accounting records at an appropriate value
presentation and publication the asset or li@@ ability is disclosed , classified and described in accordance with the applic@@ able financial reporting framework
legality and regular@@ ity a trans@@ action con@@ forms to the applic@@ able laws and regulations and is covered by sufficient budgetary appropri@@ ations
Com@@ ple@@ ten@@ ess all transactions proper to the period are entered into the accounting records
reality of operations the trans@@ action is justified by an event which per@@ tains to the body and is proper to the period
financial au@@ dit - legality and regular@@ ity of transactions
meas@@ urement the amount at which the trans@@ action is recorded is correc@@ tly established and entered in the accounting records
presentation and publication the trans@@ action is disclosed , classified and described in accordance with the applic@@ able financial reporting framework
economy the resources are made available at the appropri@@ ate@@ time , are sufficient in quanti@@ ty , are adequate in quality and are obtained for the lowest possible cost
efficiency the resources used to meet the objectives of the action provide an op@@ ti@@ mal rati@@ o between in@@ puts and out@@ puts
effectiveness the extent to which objectives are achieved and the relationship between intended and actual impact
each au@@ dit is carried out in three main stages : planning ; testing ; and reporting .
the Court under@@ takes the planning of its work programme on a multi@@ annual and annual basis .
the multi@@ annual plan allows the Court 's strategy to be defined and up@@ dated , and the ann@@ u@@ al@@ plan sets out the specific tasks to be under@@ tak@@ en@@ during the year in question .
the audi@@ tor@@ s@@ make a detailed evaluation of the risks involved and identify sources of potential au@@ dit evidence .
this in@@ form@@ ation@@ helps the audi@@ tors define the general and detailed au@@ dit objectives and the type and extent of detailed test@@ ing@@ needed to meet them .
au@@ dit objectives are a precise statement of what the au@@ dit intends to accomp@@ lish and / or the@@ questions the au@@ dit will answer .
the preliminary study report concludes with an assessment of the expected imp@@ ac@@ t@@ of a detailed au@@ dit and its overall cost .
for every au@@ dit undertaken , the audi@@ tors prepare an au@@ dit planning memorandum which sets out the au@@ dit scope , approach and objectives , and how these are to be achieved in the most efficient and cost @@@ -@@ @ effective way .
it includes deta@@ il@@ s@@ of the human and other resources needed to complete the task and practical information such as countries to be visi@@ ted@@ and how au@@ dit evidence is to be collected , as well as the au@@ dit timetable .
the planning memorandum is comple@@ men@@ ted@@ by an au@@ dit program@@ me@@ which sets out the au@@ dit testing needed in detail .
the au@@ dit planning mem@@ oranda and au@@ dit programmes are submitted for appro@@ val@@ to the au@@ dit group responsible .
the purpose of au@@ dit testing is to obtain sufficient , relevant and reliable au@@ dit evidence to allow the audi@@ tors to@@ reach conclusions on the au@@ dit objectives .
au@@ dit test@@ ing@@ is undertaken by au@@ dit teams of two or three staff .
the audi@@ tors collect evidence in accordance with@@ the au@@ dit programme , both within the European Union institutions and on @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ spot in M@@ ember and benefic@@ i@@ ary States .
depending on the type of au@@ dit , this usually involves the exam@@ ination and testing of systems and trans@@ ac@@ tion@@ sat all relevant administrative levels .
statistical sam@@ pl@@ ing@@ techniques are often used as an efficient way of ob@@ tain@@ ing@@ a representative view of a population of transactions .
for some audi@@ ts the Court uses external exper@@ t@@ stop@@ ro@@ vi@@ de specific specialist knowledge .
au@@ dit evi@@ den@@ ce@@ is obtained by the audi@@ tor in a number of ways , generally involving exam@@ in@@ ation@@ of key@@ supporting documentation , physical inspec@@ tion@@ and en@@ qu@@ iry .
the type of evidence needed depends on the trans@@ ac@@ tion@@ or au@@ dit subject in question and , in particular , on the conditions for receiving the EU aid .
systems based au@@ dit approach
audi@@ ts generally involve the direct testing of a samp@@ le of transactions in order to obtain the necessary supporting evidence .
however , the extent of this testing can be reduced when reli@@ ance is placed on the internal control systems , where it is possible and economic to do so .
if the au@@ dit testing shows that the systems are well conce@@ ived and operating effectively , the amount of direct test@@ ing@@ of transactions necessary to meet the au@@ dit objectives can be reduced .
the purpose of the statement is to allow the audi@@ tees to confirm the fac@@ tual accur@@ acy of the Court 's au@@ dit fin@@ d@@ ing@@ s@@ and to give them the opportunity to provide any further information or explan@@ ations that may be necessary .
once the audi@@ tors have obtained sufficient , relevant and reliable au@@ dit evidence , the information is analy@@ sed and used A@@ SA basis to arrive at conclu@@ sion@@ son each of the au@@ dit objectives .
the purpose of au@@ dit reports is to communicate the results of the Court 's work to the audi@@ tee , the dis@@ charge author@@ it@@ y@@ and the general public .
the publication of au@@ dit reports is an important element for ensuring transparency within the@@ process of over@@ sight over the management and use of EU funds .
the draft au@@ dit report is examined first by the au@@ dit group and then submitted for approval by the Court .
this rep@@ ly takes into account the reactions of the M@@ ember States .
depending on ther@@ ep@@ ly , the Court either maintains its original ob@@ serv@@ ations or modi@@ fies them to correct any err@@ ors or mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings .
the audi@@ tee 's rep@@ ly is published with the au@@ dit report .

the Treaty states that the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors and the sup@@ re@@ me au@@ dit institutions ( SA@@ Is ) of the M@@ ember Sta@@ tes@@ are to co@@ operate in a spirit of trust while maintaining their respective independence .
furthermore , the Treaty requires the Court 's au@@ dit visits in the M@@ ember States to be carried out in li@@ a@@ is@@ on@@ with th@@ en@@ ational sup@@ re@@ me au@@ dit institutions or other competent national au@@ dit bodies .
in practice , the national sup@@ re@@ me audi@@ t@@ institution provides the Court 's audi@@ tors with local practical and log@@ istic support as well as specific knowledge of the@@ audi@@ ted field .
the Court 's annual work programme is communic@@ ated to the SA@@ Is as well as to the European Commission , the European Parliament and the Council .

since 1996 the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors has organised regular form@@ al@@ meetings with the He@@ ads of the sup@@ re@@ me au@@ dit institutions of the candidate countries for enlargement .
the aim of th@@ is@@ co@@ operation is to develop and harmonise au@@ dit approaches and methods with a view to the efficient and effective management and control of European Union funds .
the European Court of Au@@ di@@ tors particip@@ ates in activities organised by EU@@ RO@@ SA@@ I , the European um@@ bre@@ l@@ la organis@@ ation@@ for the Supreme Au@@ dit In@@ stitu@@ tions , and IN@@ T@@ O@@ SA@@ I , the worldwide organisation .

where can I get more information ?
finally , the Ombud@@ sman makes official visits to all the M@@ ember Sta@@ tes@@ . is enables him to present his work directly to citizens .
how can I contact the Ombud@@ sman ?
the European Commission agreed to reconsider a decision to co @@@ -@@ @ finance the construction of a dual carri@@ age@@ way after an inquiry by the Ombud@@ sman@@ .@@ A@@ n Irish citizen had complained because no proper environmental study of the planned dual carri@@ age@@ way had been done .
during the Ombud@@ sman 's inquiry , the Commission carried out a study and concluded that the proposed dual carri@@ age@@ way was in breach of EU policy and law .
a Belgian architect was given a second chance in a call for tenders organised by the European Parliament after she complained to the Ombud@@ sman .
the Parliament agreed to re @@@ -@@ @ launch the call after it emerged that the compla@@ in@@ ant had been treated un@@ fairly .
who else could help me ?
if you have a problem with a national , regional or local administration , ple@@ ase visit :
Sta@@ te@@ watch , a UK @@@ -@@ @ based group monitoring civil liber@@ ties in the EU , obtained documents from the Council of the European Union after the Ombud@@ sman interven@@ ed .
the Council had refused to release the documents but re@@ considered its initial decision in light of the arguments presented by the Ombud@@ sman .
where you will find details of all national and regional ombud@@ s@@ men in the EU and the applican@@ t countries for EU member@@ ship@@ . e@@ ir contact details can also be obtained by ph@@ oning the European Ombud@@ sman 's offic@@ e@@ . CE .
what does he do ?
who can complain and how ?
what complaints can he deal with ?
a complaint form is available from the Ombud@@ sman 's office and can be down@@ loaded from the Ombud@@ sman 's website .
only the Court of Justice and the Court of First In@@ stance acting in their judicial role do not fall within his jurisdiction .
e Ombud@@ sman usually conduc@@ ts inqu@@ iri@@ es on the basis of complaints but can also launch inqu@@ iri@@ es on his own initiative .
e Ombud@@ sman investig@@ ates cases of poor or failed administration .
many of the complaints lo@@ d@@ ged with the Ombud@@ sman concern administrative delay , lack of transparency or refusal of access to information .
some concern work relations between the European institutions and their agents , recru@@ it@@ ment of staff@@ and the running of competitions .
others are related to contr@@ actual relations between the European institutions and private fir@@ m@@ s@@ . firms .
what outcome can be expected ?
what does he not do ?
what if he can@@ not handle the complaint ?
e Ombud@@ sman may simply need to inform the institution concerned about a complaint in order for it to resolve the problem .
if the attempt at conc@@ iliation fails , the Ombud@@ sman can make recommendations to solve the case .
if the institution does not accept his recommendations , he can make a special report to the European Parliament .

on the one hand , the Ombud@@ sman acts as an external mechanism of control , investigating complaints about mal@@ administration and recommen@@ ding correc@@ tive action where necessary .
but equally the Code serves as a useful guide and a resource for civil servants , encouraging the highest standards of administration .
with the Charter making up Par@@ t II of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , we can be sure that this right will become increasingly mean@@ ing@@ ful in the coming years .
citizens and officials have shown much interest in the Code since its adoption by the European Parliament in September 2001 .
as European Ombud@@ sman , I feel it is my duty to further raise awareness of the rights and obligations contained there@@ in .
it is for this reason that we have chosen to publish a new version in all of the official EU languages , as well as in the languages of the candidate countries .
I hope that the Code will continue to serve as a useful working tool for public administr@@ ations and as a reference point for citizens all over Europe .
e Code takes account of the principles of European administrative law contained in the case law of the Court of Justice and also draws in@@ spir@@ ation from national laws .
the European Code of Go@@ od Administ@@ r@@ ative behaviour e Charter includes as fundamental rights of Union citizenship the right to good administration ( art .
is Code is intended to explain in more detail what the Charter  s right to good administration should mean in practice .

this followed a complaint from a Hungarian citizen who had applied to take part in a competition for assistant transla@@ tors .
the Ombud@@ sman felt that providing additional clar@@ ifications would help avoid mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings and improve relations with candidates .
the European Ombud@@ sman investig@@ ates complaints about mal@@ administration in the institutions and bodies of the European Union .
the Ombud@@ sman is completely independent and im@@ partial .
the current Ombud@@ sman is M@@ r P@@ . Nik@@ ifor@@ os Di@@ aman@@ do@@ ur@@ os who took office on 1 April 2003 .
• The Ombud@@ sman criticised the Council for failing to deal properly and carefully with a request for public access to documents .
this followed an inquiry which revealed that , contrary to the Council 's initial response to the compla@@ in@@ ant concerning the number of relevant documents , many additional documents in fact existed .
as a result of the Ombud@@ sman 's investigation , the compla@@ in@@ ant was given access to the additional documents .
what does he not do ?
what outcome can be expected ?
he was elected by the European Parliament and has held office since 1 April 2003 . the Parliament elected the

the Ombud@@ sman may simply need to inform the institution concerned about a complaint in order for it to resolve the problem .
if the case is not resolved satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily during the course of his inqu@@ iri@@ es , the Ombud@@ sman will try , if possible , to find a friendly solution which puts right the case of mal@@ administration and satis@@ fies the compla@@ in@@ ant .
if the attempt at conc@@ iliation fails , the Ombud@@ sman can make recommendations to solve the case .
if the institution does not accept his recommendations , he can make a special report to the
• the activities of national courts or ombud@@ s@@ men .
• complaints against businesses or private individuals .
who can complain and how ?
what complaints can he deal with ?
if you are a citizen of a M@@ ember State of the Union or resi@@ de in a M@@ ember State , you can make a complaint to the European Ombud@@ sman .
businesses , associations or other bodies with a registered office in the Union may also complain to the Ombud@@ sman .
the Ombud@@ sman investig@@ ates cases of mal@@ administration ( poor or failed administration ) .
Mal@@ administration occur@@ s if an institution fails to act in accordance with the law , fails to respect the principles of good administration , or viola@@ tes human rights .
some examples are :
• A Polish citizen , disabled as a result of a car accident , who alleged that the national social security institution had un@@ fairly decided to suspend payment of his benefits .
with the compla@@ in@@ ant 's consent , the case was transferred to the Polish Ombud@@ sman to be dealt with .
the European Ombud@@ sman investig@@ ates complaints about mal@@ administration in the institutions and bodies of the European Union ( EU ) .
the institutions include , among others , the European Commission , the Council of the EU and the European Parliament .
the European Medi@@ cin@@ es Agency and the European Foundation for the Im@@ prov@@ ement of Li@@ ving and Wor@@ king Con@@ di@@ tions are examples of Union bodies that he can investigate .
only the Court of Justice , the Court of First In@@ stance , and the Civil Service Tribunal acting in their judicial role do not fall within his jurisdiction .
complaints can be lo@@ d@@ ged by post , fax or e @@@ -@@ @ mail .
a complaint guide and form is available from the Ombud@@ sman 's office and can be down@@ loaded from the Ombud@@ sman 's website .
the Ombud@@ sman usually conduc@@ ts inqu@@ iri@@ es on the basis of complaints but can also launch inqu@@ iri@@ es on his own initiative .
• administrative irregularities • un@@ fair@@ ness • discrimination • abuse of power • failure to rep@@ ly • refusal of information • unnecessary delay
• Spanish citizens who called for action at the EU and national levels to address the problem of illegal immigration from North Africa .
if the Ombud@@ sman is not able to investigate the complaint - for example , if it concerns national , regional or local administr@@ ations in the M@@ ember States - he will still do his best to help you solve your problem .

European Defence Agency ( E@@ DA )
the European Union Institute for Security Studies was created by a Council joint action on 20 July 2001 .
its aim is to help create a common European security culture , to support the strategic debate by providing the best possible inter@@ face between Euro -@@ p@@ ean decis@@ ion@@ makers and the di@@ verse circles of non @@@ -@@ @ official specialists .
the institute 's activities are directed towards data analysis and recommendations necessary for EU policy@@ making .
consequently , the institute contributes to the development of the European Union common foreign and security policy ( C@@ F@@ SP ) by exec@@ ut@@ ing several main tasks : research and debate on the major security and defence issues that are of re@@ lev@@ ance to the EU ; forward @@@ -@@ @ looking analysis for the Union 's Council and High Representative ; and development of a trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic dialogue on all security issues with the countries of Europe , Canada and the United States .
the institute has an autonomous status and intellectual freedom , which means that it does not represent or defend any particular national interest .
illi@@ cit drug use and trafficking are worldwide phenom@@ ena that threaten health and social stability .
statistics show that one European citizen dies every hour from a drug over@@ d@@ ose and close to 8 000 Europeans lose their lives to drugs every year .
meanwhile , ever @@@ -@@ @ changing pat@@ ter@@ ns in supply and demand call for constant monitoring and dynamic responses .
independent , science @@@ -@@ @ based information is a vital resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them .
it was on this pre@@ mis@@ e , and in the face of an escal@@ ating drug phenomenon , that the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) was established in 1993 .
inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995 , it is one of the EU 's decentral@@ ised agencies .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA exists to provide the EU and its M@@ ember States with a fac@@ tual over@@ view of European drug problems and a solid evidence base to support the drugs debate .
today it offers policymakers the data they need for drawing up informed drug laws and strategies .
it also helps professionals and practi@@ tion@@ ers working in the field pin@@ point best practice and new areas of research .
at the heart of the agency 's work is the promotion of scientific exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce .
to achieve its core task of providing sound and compar@@ able information on drugs in Europe , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has developed the infrastructure and tools needed to collect country data in a harmon@@ ised way .
these data are then f@@ ed by national drug monitoring centres ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x network ) to the Lisbon agency for analysis , resulting in a variety of information products convey@@ ing the broader European picture .
while the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is primarily European in focus , it also works with partners in other world regions , ex@@ changing information and expertise .
collaboration with European and international organisations in the drugs field is also central to its work as a means of enhancing understanding of the global drugs phenomenon .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA works on the principle that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs .
although it does not propose policy , the agency is now making a clear impact on decision @@@ -@@ @ making through its analy@@ ses , standards and tools .
what we do
the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's main output is its ye@@ arly over@@ view of the European drug phenomenon which it presents in a multi@@ lin@@ gual annual report package .
this is essential reading for policymakers , scientists and practi@@ tion@@ ers in the drugs field or anyone seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .

monitoring the drug situation
these bodies are the main information inter@@ face between the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and its M@@ ember States .
as such , they provide national drug information to the agency for EU @@@ -@@ @ level analysis and play the role of E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA " ambassadors " at home .
understanding the nature and scale of the drugs problem is a critical requirement for effective policy@@ making and action .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . key indicators , core dat@@ as@@ ets ) which offer countries a " common language " with which to interpre@@ t the drug phenomenon .
as well as monitoring the drug situation today , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is ever vig@@ il@@ ant to new drugs and trends that may pose a future threat to our societies .
here it plays an active role in early @@@ -@@ @ warning and risk @@@ -@@ @ assessment activities through legal instruments and case studies .
responding to drug problems n u l l
monitoring drug interven@@ tions , laws and policies is firmly en@@ shr@@ ined in the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's work .
by providing a European over@@ view of such responses to drug problems , it helps countries follow trends and design appropriate strategies .

conclusions
initially , there was no reference framework available - obser@@ vat@@ ories were set up using trial and er@@ ror , taking into account different national con@@ tex@@ ts and resources .
this explains why today there are as many models of obser@@ vat@@ ories as there are countries establishing them .
starting from a highly het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous group of drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories across different contin@@ ents , the en@@ deavour is to extr@@ act the essence of their experience and to trans@@ mit the final result in such a way that it can be re@@ interpreted in other re@@ alities and conditions .
although this is the outcome of a long elabor@@ ation and ref@@ le@@ ction process , the hand@@ book itself should be considered more as a starting point , rather than as a final achievement .
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book documents .
over time , the to@@ ol@@ box will develop with the help of readers and operational national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories : it will provide a platform for sharing practical materials and reference models .

these are only a few of the questions that this hand@@ book tries to address in a practical manner , starting with the most important one : why do we need a national drugs observatory ?
a growing need for monitoring
the adoption of the United N@@ ations Con@@ ven@@ tions (
States to regularly report on the drugs situation as well as on interven@@ tions , covering both supply and demand .
one of the first consequences of this form@@ alised approach was an acknowled@@ gement of the need to set up national monitoring systems and obser@@ vat@@ ories .
" evidence base " : a new concept for policy@@ making
since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , the concept of " evidence @@@ -@@ @ based policy @@@ -@@ @ making " has emerged as a new standard in public management ( see box below ) .
this change highlights the need for governments to take better informed decisions , and to assess whether the measures taken have been implemented and if they have been successful .
similarly , the public is increasingly demanding this sort of information from its leaders .
from monitoring to evaluation
2 the Political Declaration and Plan of Action ( ... ) " (
a key role for national obser@@ vat@@ ories
what we can conclude from the various working groups , public and expert debates that took place in 2008 and 2009 and that are still ongoing , is very simple :
• sup@@ ran@@ ational or international drug information networks can only work if they receive high quality , compar@@ able information from their respective participating countries ;
• national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories can make a key contribution to international community efforts on data collection , analysis and interpre@@ tation ;
• a national drugs observatory is a key instrument for policy@@ making - it is not a political instrument .
wh@@ il@@ st the political responsibility remains in the hands of decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , there is a growing consensus that they need objective , fac@@ tual , reliable and compar@@ able information in order to take informed decisions .
this hand@@ book targets the needs of three groups , with a specific objective for each of them :
• countries that are or that may become candidates to EU membership ( 3 ) , and neighbourhood countries ( 4 ) that wish and / or need to prepare themselves to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ;
• countries that are part of other regional data collection systems on drugs , such as the Inter@@ am@@ er@@ ic@@ an Dru@@ gs Ob@@ ser@@ vatory C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS , to assess their situation and to build strategies so as to improve and / or to consolidate their national obser@@ vat@@ ories ;
• non @@@ -@@ @ EU countries involved in a co@@ operation on drugs matters with the EU and with other
) , and with public and private international donors in the drugs field that want to evaluate the effectiveness of their grants and activities .
we must inform the re@@ ader of the following in relation to this publication :
• this hand@@ book buil@@ ds on the experience of establishing and developing a European data collection network composed by national fo@@ cal points - the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x network .
although it presents a concep@@ tual framework , it is based on practice in establishing the network 15 years ago , and in expanding it to more than 15 new countries since then .
we have tried to identify the key principles and functions that have proven successful over the years ;
• we do not offer a single model to be cop@@ ied , but strategic and operational steps and an indication of the sor@@ ts of decisions that should be taken on the basis of a struc@@ tured analysis of each national context .
this hand@@ book provides the re@@ ader with a mat@@ ri@@ x for this strategic and operational analysis ;
the hand@@ book is divided into several parts :
• What is a national drugs observatory ( C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) • running a national drugs observatory :
a national drugs observatory ( N@@ D@@ O ) is an organisation that provides its country with fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information concerning drugs and drug addi@@ ction and their consequences .
the objectives of the N@@ D@@ O are :
• to provide its national audience with the information seen as essential for policy@@ making and for the organisation of drug @@@ -@@ @ related services , and on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues of general interest ;
• to collect and to produce the information needed to fulfil its country 's reporting obligations to sup@@ ran@@ ational and international monitoring and drug @@@ -@@ @ control programmes .
to reach its objectives , the N@@ D@@ O must perform three core functions , either with its own resources or in con@@ jun@@ ction with other national institutions and experts :
• data collection and monitoring at national level ; • analysis and interpre@@ tation of the information collected ; • reporting and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the results .
the main publication produced by the N@@ D@@ O on a ye@@ arly basis is its national report or at least an up@@ date on the national situation .
in addition to this report , an N@@ D@@ O may be expected to produce ad ho@@ c studies and other reports .
while establishing or evalu@@ ating the position of a national drugs observatory , it is also necessary to assess its success and sustainability using three key strategic factors :
• perceived added value ; • avail@@ ability and combination of resources ; and • co@@ operative production processes .
a national drugs observatory ( N@@ D@@ O ) is an organisation that aims to provide - for its home country - fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information concerning drugs and
1 drug addi@@ ction (
) , and their consequences .
according to national priorities , the scope of the work of the N@@ D@@ O may focus only on illi@@ cit drugs , or could also cover alcohol , tobacco and other li@@ cit drugs ( such as pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs ) .
we limit our presentation here to illi@@ cit drugs as these are the primary mandate of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS .
an N@@ D@@ O is ide@@ ally part of a broader system that combin@@ es :
• a concer@@ ted and balanced national drugs Co@@ ordination mechanism , which over@@ sees the various actors implementing a national drugs strategy ;
• a national drugs information network , that in@@ tegra@@ tes specialised and general sources of information and expertise , as well as rout@@ ine surveillance programmes and ad ho@@ c surveys on target groups .
the N@@ D@@ O collec@@ ts and produces information for two main audiences : national and sup@@ ra@@ - or international .
national audience : the N@@ D@@ O addresses the information needs of four groups of customers which make up its audience at national level : decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , the scientific community , professionals working in the drugs field , and the general public .
as far as the work of an N@@ D@@ O is concerned , we use the term " core functions " to describe the key processes to be developed and implemented by the N@@ D@@ O .
in order to present the core functions of an N@@ D@@ O , we have adap@@ ted the concept of " business process . "
what is " business process " ?
Dav@@ en@@ port and Short ( 1990 ) define business process as " a set of log@@ ically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome . "
a process is " a struc@@ tured , meas@@ ured set of activities designed to produce a specified output for a particular cust@@ o@@ mer or market . it
2 imp@@ lies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organisation " (
business processes have four common character@@ isti@@ cs :
cross @@@ -@@ @ organis@@ ational boundaries : the N@@ D@@ O reli@@ es on a multi @@@ -@@ @ partner co@@ operation framework , on intensive networking practices that allow the N@@ D@@ O to acquire the expertise and information needed .
this imp@@ lies a permanent screening of its environment and frequent adjustments in the mo@@ du@@ s oper@@ an@@ di negotiated with all partners .
customers or stak@@ ehol@@ ders : in organisations based in or depending on the public sector , stak@@ ehol@@ ders play a vital role because they attract funds and allow the N@@ D@@ O to operate .
Mal@@ ho@@ tra , Y@@ . , " Business process re@@ design : an over@@ view , " I@@ E@@ E@@ E Engin@@ eering Management Revi@@ ew , volume 26 , No 3 , Aut@@ umn 1998 .
process : the emphasis is on how activities are organised and how results are obtained .
the processes may be struc@@ tured differ@@ ently , according to context , resources and capabilities , provided that the expected out@@ puts are clearly defined and are produced on time .
output : each of the core functions should deliver out@@ puts , whether raw data or specific information , analy@@ tical reports , targeted public@@ ations or standard reporting .
the three core functions of an N@@ D@@ O are :
• data collection and monitoring • analysis and interpre@@ tation of the data collected • reporting and dis@@ sem@@ ination of results .
the core functions are usually carried out by the N@@ D@@ O in con@@ jun@@ ction with other national institutions and experts .
depending on the resources and the mandate of the N@@ D@@ O , and on the data and expertise available in the country , a range of possible set @@@ -@@ @ ups are possible , as presented in C@@ hap@@ ter 7 - Chal@@ len@@ ging questions ) .
in the European Union , this is the role of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's national fo@@ cal points , which together form the European network for data collection on drugs , called Re@@ it@@ o@@ x ( R@@ é@@ se@@ au Europ@@ é@@ en d '@@ Information sur les To@@ x@@ ic@@ om@@ an@@ ies ) .
data collection and monitoring at national level
various kinds of drug @@@ -@@ @ related information are usually already produced in some form by agencies at local or national level .
in such cases , the N@@ D@@ O can have the role of bringing together all available information into a national picture .
in order to do so , the N@@ D@@ O must first identify what information is available and create an " information map . "
this is a document that identi@@ fies and clas@@ si@@ fies potential data providers of drugs information and partner organisations .
part of the work of an N@@ D@@ O consists of " s@@ can@@ ning " national sources of drug @@@ -@@ @ related information to identify streng@@ ths and g@@ aps .
in order to gather , produce , analy@@ se and dis@@ semin@@ ate information in a regular manner , the N@@ D@@ O must build a sustainable network that is able to work continu@@ ously on its own improvement .
one of the main tasks of the N@@ D@@ O is to establish a national drug information network together with the partners and resources identified in the information map .
the drugs phenomenon and its impact on society are permanently changing .
science , and our knowledge and understanding of the drugs phenomenon , are also in constant evol@@ ution .
the demands placed on the drugs information network must therefore be respon@@ sive to change .
in other words , developing the drug information network , and the related networking tasks , is part of an ongoing process that represents the N@@ D@@ O 's principal and most time @@@ -@@ @ consum@@ ing activity .
a key task is to li@@ a@@ ise with information or data providers , and to motiv@@ ate them to participate and contribute to the national drug information network .
another ongoing aspect of developing the af@@ ore@@ mentioned network is a constant effort to improve the knowledge base .
this may be achieved either by improving existing processes and national reporting standards , and / or by establishing new sources of information .
the ability to raise awareness and funds for improving the national data collection network is extremely useful in this context .
the N@@ D@@ O needs staff with excellent communication and negotiation skills and a proven capacity for consensus @@@ -@@ @ building .
the challenge for the N@@ D@@ O lies in the constant and mutual inter@@ connection of sup@@ pl@@ y@@ - and deman@@ d@@ related information networks , in a way that offers added value for all partners and is logisti@@ cally feasible .
analysis and interpre@@ tation of the information collected
the information gathered by means of the drug information network needs further processing to be of practical use to the N@@ D@@ O 's audiences .
this is usually done by combin@@ ing the analy@@ tical capacity of N@@ D@@ O staff and national experts .
the N@@ D@@ O pro@@ gres@@ sively buil@@ ds its expertise in providing rigor@@ ous scientific , un@@ biased and non @@@ -@@ @ spec@@ ula@@ tive interpre@@ tation and analysis of the data collected , and in syn@@ th@@ es@@ ising it into
the analysis and interpre@@ tation of the information collected should focus on :
• integr@@ ating information der@@ ived from different sources , covering a range of areas , in order to provide a comprehensive over@@ view and understanding of the drugs situation .
to carry out these activities , the N@@ D@@ O must work with national institutions and other experts , so as to ensure :
• the pro@@ gressive building of a common and comprehensive picture of the drugs situation in the country concerned ;
• shared ownership of the results by all partners involved .
reporting and dis@@ sem@@ ination of results
reporting and communic@@ ating results should be seen as one of the key tasks of the national drugs observatory .
ultimately , out@@ puts help justify the N@@ D@@ O 's existence , and they are one of the main reasons why it receives funds from national authorities and international organisations .
in most cases , the main publication produced by the N@@ D@@ O on a ye@@ arly basis will be a national report or an executive sum@@ m@@ ary of the latest developments in the national context .
it is of particular importance that the N@@ D@@ O provides an up@@ date of the national drugs situation ye@@ arly , both for national and for international purposes .
in addition to the national report , the N@@ D@@ O may also be expected to produce reports on ad ho@@ c studies and to provide evidence for the evaluation of national strategies and action plans .
• Com@@ bin@@ ed resources : in practice , a successful N@@ D@@ O is the result of a combination of local , national and sup@@ ran@@ ational resources , whether human , scientific and / or financial .
therefore , special attention should be paid to identi@@ fying , artic@@ ulating and consol@@ id@@ ating these resources ;
a critical issue for the development and strengthening of the N@@ D@@ O lies within its capacity and its processes for the production of reports and other public@@ ations in co@@ operation with its national and local partners .
chapter 3@@ R@@ un@@ ning a national drugs observatory - data collection and monitoring
what are we looking for ?
how to proceed ?
what kind of data / information are needed ?
monitoring and other drug @@@ -@@ @ related data collection activities started three decades ago in different regions of the world , under the auspices of various international and regional organisations .
in 2000 , an international expert meeting held in Lisbon led to the adoption of a common reference framework for data collection and monitoring shared by international and
1 sup@@ ran@@ ational organisations , called the Lisbon consensus (
the full document can be found on the UNODC website at the following link : h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ un@@ od@@ c@@ .org / p@@ d@@ f / drug _ demand _ gap _ Lisbon _ consen@@ sus@@ .@@ p@@ d@@ f
O@@ AS ) , the National Institute on Dru@@ g Ab@@ use ( N@@ I@@ DA ) , the World Health Organ@@ ization , the International E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology Wor@@ k@@ group and the Global HIV Preven@@ tion Research Network .
the Lisbon consensus identi@@ fies 13 areas of strategic / policy interest which are monitored using a range of tools and form@@ ats , by all sup@@ ran@@ ational and international organisations :
• Dru@@ g consumption among the general population ( pre@@ val@@ ence and inci@@ dence ) ;
• Dru@@ g consumption by young people ( pre@@ val@@ ence and inci@@ dence ) ;
• Dru@@ g consumption by special or vulnerable populations ;
• Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty ;
• Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related emergency room visits ;
• P@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty directly attributed to drug consumption ;
• Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related mortality ;
• Social exclu@@ sion and dis@@ advantage ;
• Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related crime ( violations of drug laws ; pro@@ portion of property crimes associated with drug consumption ; pro@@ portion of violent crimes associated with drug consumption ) ;
• Economic costs of drug consumption ;
information on drug avail@@ ability and drug markets .
based on this list , each regional or international drug monitoring network has developed its own model taking into account its specific needs and its institutional environment , but the core data remain the same .
further comments will be made in C@@ hap@@ ter 5 , under the heading " Reporting to sup@@ ran@@ ational and international organisations . "
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA reli@@ es on a network of national fo@@ cal points or national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories - the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x network - which is responsible for collecting the data at national level .
one of the key assets of this monitoring system is that it is comp@@ ul@@ sory for EU M@@ ember States
as such , and the fact that it is one of the instruments of the European approach on drugs ( its adoption and transp@@ os@@ ition at national level is mandatory for any country seeking future EU membership .
the European monitoring system developed by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA (
) is struc@@ tured so as to cover two main areas : " monitoring the situation " which covers ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology , crime and markets , and " monitoring responses " which covers interven@@ tions , law and policies .
monitoring the situation - E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology , crime and markets
work in this area is struc@@ tured around three main components : key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators , crime and markets and the action on new drugs .
5 key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators :
drug situation : E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology , crime and markets
General population surveys and youth surveys Pro@@ b@@ lem drug use Tre@@ at@@ ment demand indicator Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related deaths Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases
crime and markets :
drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime Av@@ ail@@ ability of illi@@ cit drugs
action on new drugs :
early warning system Ris@@ k assessment Control measures
key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators (
these indicators under@@ pin the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's reporting on trends and developments in the EU drug situation .
they are also used for the analysis of the coverage of responses or the assessment of the impact of policies and actions .
General population surveys and youth surveys
pre@@ val@@ ence and pat@@ ter@@ ns of drug use among the general population are meas@@ ured by prob@@ abil@@ istic surveys of the ad@@ ult and school population .
this key indicator collec@@ ts data on the pre@@ val@@ ence and inci@@ dence of problem drug use ( P@@ D@@ U ) at national and local level .
problem drug use is defined as " in@@ j@@ ecting drug use or long @@@ -@@ @ dur@@ ation / regular use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , cocaine and / or amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines . "
the data sources employed to calc@@ ulate the estimates differ in each country and are dependent on the rout@@ ine information systems used in the country .
the treatment demand indicator is used to describe the population of drug users entering treatment each year and the number continuing in treatment from one year to the next .
the treatment demand indicator ( T@@ DI ) consists of recommendations regarding method , defin@@ itions and items to be collected in relation to problem drug users presenting to drug treatment facilities .
these data are collected and col@@ lated nation@@ ally , and delivered annually .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths and mortality among drug users
the aim of this indicator is to obtain statistics on the number and character@@ isti@@ cs of people who die directly or indirectly as a consequence of drug use .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related mortality is a complex phenomenon , which accounts for a considerable percentage of deaths among young people in many countries .
this ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicator has two components : deaths directly caused by illegal drugs ( drug @@@ -@@ @ indu@@ ced deaths ) and mortality rates among problem drug users .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases ( D@@ R@@ ID )
the data is collected on I@@ D@@ U@@ s each cal@@ end@@ ar year using two main methods .
these are : ( a ) surveys of I@@ D@@ U@@ s that include
according to the situation outside Europe , it may be necessary to collect data on other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases that are related directly or indirectly to drug use or drugs users , such as tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis and sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted inf@@ ections .
crime and markets
other data are collected to comple@@ ment the picture of the drugs situation from a law enforcement perspective , targeting drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime and avail@@ ability .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime
based on international literature and evaluation practices , the defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es four categories :
• P@@ sy@@ ch@@ op@@ harmac@@ ological crimes : crimes committed under the influence of a psy@@ cho@@ active sub@@ stance , as a result of its ac@@ ute or chron@@ ic use .
• Economic @@@ -@@ @ comp@@ ul@@ sive crimes : crimes committed in order to obtain money ( or drugs ) to support drug use .
• system@@ ic crimes : crimes committed within the functioning of illi@@ cit drug markets , as part of the business of drug supply , distribution and use .
• Dru@@ g law offences : crimes committed in violation of drug ( and other related ) legislation .
avail@@ ability of illi@@ cit drugs
drug seiz@@ ures can be as much an indicator of law enforcement activity in terms of supply reduction as they are of drug avail@@ ability , but if cross @@@ -@@ @ checked with qual@@ it@@ ative information they may be a confirmation of drug flows .
price and poten@@ cy / p@@ urity of illi@@ cit drugs may both impact on the perceived avail@@ ability of illi@@ cit drugs and reflect supply side factors ( affecting access to drugs ) .
as such , they are considered as indirect indicators of drug avail@@ ability .
• an " early @@@ -@@ @ warning system " to identify new drugs as they appear on the European market ;
• a decision @@@ -@@ @ making process ( control measures ) through which these products may be placed under control in the EU M@@ ember States .
the action on new drugs mechanism :
• is a unique tool combin@@ ing public health and law enforcement institutions and information , with the aim to provide a M@@ ulti@@ disciplinary risk assessment ;
• control measures that may be decided by the Council are mandatory for the EU M@@ ember States .

the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has developed an online resource for professionals , policymakers and researchers in the areas of drug @@@ -@@ @ related prevention , treatment , harm reduction and social re@@ integration .
the portal concent@@ rates on illi@@ cit drugs and pol@@ y@@ drug use and has a clear European focus .
its main aim is to provide tools and standards to improve the quality of interven@@ tions and highlight examples of best practice across Europe .
prevention
since 1994 , a new framework for clas@@ si@@ fying prevention into universal , selec@@ tive and indicated prevention interven@@ tions replaces the previous concep@@ ts of primary , secondary , and ter@@ ti@@ ary prevention .
the gui@@ ding principle of this new clas@@ si@@ fication is the target population by ass@@ ump@@ tions concerning its risk for sub@@ stance abuse , but not the overall objective or content of a prevention intervention , as was the case previously .
reduction of drug @@@ -@@ @ related harm
drug treatment
ensuring the avail@@ ability of , and access to , targeted and diversi@@ fied treatment and improving the quality of treatment are core to reducing drug demand .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA collec@@ ts information through several treatment monitoring tools which aim to :
• address the policies and interven@@ tions M@@ ember States have established to provide evidence @@@ -@@ @ based drug treatment .
more precisely , a specific tool is aimed at collecting data about the policies and organis@@ ational framework of drug treatment , as well as avail@@ ability , acces@@ sibility and diversi@@ fication of treatment ;
• collect data through which the quality assur@@ ance measures that countries have taken to achieve and maintain a high quality of treatment service provision can be documented ;
• collect quanti@@ t@@ ative data on the number of people reached by drug treatment in M@@ ember States , and more specifically the number of clients receiving sub@@ stitution / maintenance treatment .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has developed a monitoring tool which addresses the policies and interven@@ tions that M@@ ember States have established to protect drug users from further exclu@@ sion and to improve their social inclusion .
interven@@ tions in the criminal justice system
this area of work covers three issues :
• the situation and assistance to drug users in prisons ; • law @@@ -@@ @ enforcement measures as an alternative to prison for drug offen@@ ders , and ;
• law @@@ -@@ @ enforcement measures especially targeting stat@@ ut@@ ory di@@ ver@@ sions addressed at young offen@@ ders , in order to avoid their pro@@ gres@@ sion into the criminal justice system .
national strategies , Co@@ ordination mechanisms and legislation
monitoring national and Community drug strategies and policies and their impact on the drug situation is a key E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA activity . it has three main objectives :
• monitoring and describing policies , their framework and their relevant context ; • contributing to policy analysis ; • contributing to policy evaluation .
the specific topics covered include :
• EU drugs strategy ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) and action plan ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) ; • EU drug legislation ; • national strategies / action plans on drugs ; • national drug legislation ; • Co@@ ordination arrangements in the field of drugs ; • public expendi@@ ture on drugs .
the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Ob@@ ser@@ vatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID )
the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Ob@@ ser@@ vatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID ) is the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission 's ( C@@ IC@@ AD ) statistical , information and scientific research branch .
the Ob@@ ser@@ vatory helps countries to improve the collection and analysis of drug @@@ -@@ @ related data : by promoting the establishment of national obser@@ vat@@ ories and the use of stand@@ ardis@@ ed

the primary drug use research system at the O@@ ID is the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g U@@ se D@@ ata
) ( SI@@ D@@ U@@ C ) , an ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology @@@ -@@ @ based system that comp@@ rises surveys on drug use for populations .
the SI@@ D@@ U@@ C system applies stand@@ ardis@@ ed meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies , in order to produce drug use data that are compar@@ able across countries .
the objective of the system is to obtain ti@@ mely , reliable and compar@@ able data between countries .
this allows the O@@ ID to monitor the drug problem in the region based on a con@@ ste@@ l@@ lation of indicators :
• pre@@ val@@ ence of sub@@ stance use ( lif@@ etime , past year and past month ) of illi@@ cit drugs and also alcohol and tobacco ;
in addition , the following research protocols to study the consequences of drug use have been developed or are currently under development : emergency rooms ; treatment centres ; and mortality associated with drug use .
finally , three stand@@ ardis@@ ed protocols are available to study the relationship between drug use and crime in ad@@ ult prisoners , juven@@ ile offen@@ ders and arres@@ tees .
in addition to quanti@@ t@@ ative research , the O@@ ID has carried out qual@@ it@@ ative research studies on street children , and sex workers , among others .
it also works closely with several national governments in the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an to establish solid information networks within the country .
these networks such as those in Bar@@ bad@@ os and Tr@@ in@@ i@@ dad and Tob@@ ago integrate information from the many social sectors that participate in and contribute to the fight against drugs .
the O@@ ID 's Research and Development Programme
E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ological research forms the foundation the O@@ ID 's work in Latin America and the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an , and is the sine qu@@ a non of any drug information system .
in order to develop robust drug information networks throughout the region , the O@@ ID 's initial focus is to build a
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book solid ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology based network in each country , leading toward the development of trend data on drug use throughout the region .
to further support research and development , the O@@ ID developed the Latin American

abuse and the World Health Organ@@ ization ( WHO ) , and is comprised of 17 indicators in four areas : healthcare , crime , labour productivity , and other costs .
to date , cost studies have been carried out in Argentina , Bar@@ bad@@ os , Ch@@ ile , Costa R@@ ica , El Salvador , Mexico and U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay .
Col@@ om@@ bia has also carried out a study on crime attri@@ but@@ able to drug use through this programme .
these studies represent first studies of their kind in the region to quanti@@ fy in economic terms the impact of the drug problem in these respective countries .
strengthening drug obser@@ vat@@ ories in Latin America and the Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an
the O@@ ID supports the development and establishment of drug obser@@ vat@@ ories in the region .
to further this effort , the O@@ ID is embar@@ king on a collabor@@ ative en@@ deav@@ or with the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction to develop a meth@@ od@@ ological tool to
( 2001 ) , " The International guidelines for esti@@ m@@ ating the costs of Dru@@ g Ab@@ use , " The Canadian Centre on
sub@@ stance Ab@@ use ( C@@ C@@ SA ) .
although local data collection may already exist , the process of establishing a national drugs observatory is usually linked to the need to provide sub @@@ -@@ @ regional or international organisations with data on the national drugs situation .
this should be documented in a clear and conc@@ ise manner for consideration by policymakers .
in many cases , an executive sum@@ m@@ ary in national language ( s ) may be drafted to engage all possible stak@@ ehol@@ ders .
at this stage , there should be a sum@@ m@@ ary document giving an over@@ view of what can ide@@ ally be achieved within a few years .

N@@ ation@@ al@@ mandate and expectations
ti@@ ps for N@@ D@@ O building
when adopting a national reference framework for reporting :
• adap@@ t the relevant international reference framework into a national one , taking into account the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate and trans@@ late it in the national language ( s )
• Pre@@ par@@ e an explan@@ atory document presenting the N@@ D@@ O , its mandate , goals and objectives , the expected products / results ( up to three pages )
• Pre@@ par@@ e an executive sum@@ m@@ ary of the national reference framework with a short descri@@ ption of information needed , and stress the benef@@ i t it will bring nation@@ ally .
why make a map ?
prior to setting up an N@@ D@@ O , drug @@@ -@@ @ related information already exists in some form or another at national level .
however , a problem frequently en@@ countered is that this information is not collected in a co@@ ordinated and systematic manner , which may be compo@@ unded when some of the actors involved do not work together .
the objective of the information map is therefore t@@ wo@@ fold :
sources of information / datab@@ ases
the N@@ D@@ O must first identify what information is already available by identi@@ fying and clas@@ si@@ fying existing sources of information , covering both demand and supply .
this " information map " is not a one @@@ -@@ @ off exercise , but a living document that should be constantly up@@ dated to reflect new needs for information , or new data sources .
available sources of expertise
data in relation to the complex drug phenomenon are of little value if not put into context and analy@@ sed .
to identify national experts and professionals who could contribute either to a better understanding or to a better reporting of the national situation is very important .
the information map exercise therefore allows you to do the following :
• make an invent@@ ory of data and information available ; • establish a first contact with potential network members ; • promote the project of establishing a national drugs observatory .
how to prepare the map ?
at the start it can be difficult identi@@ fying who to contact and where to find them .
this is why a check@@ list is needed to identify areas , sectors and institutions to be cont@@ acted .
once a group of institutions has been identified , a detailed search for persons and contact information can begin .
such information is read@@ ily available now@@ ad@@ ays , via the Internet or government direc@@ tories .
these potential contacts are then included in the same check@@ list , in order to identify g@@ aps and further investigation needed .
figure 2 : example of a check@@ list - drug @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases
check@@ list : 5 key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators :
public health institute
- General population surveys and youth surveys - Pro@@ b@@ lem drug use - Tre@@ at@@ ment demand indicator - Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related deaths - Dru@@ g @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases ( D@@ R@@ ID )
drug @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases
at this stage , before cont@@ acting people , it is useful to prepare a one page document presenting :
once the relevant contact people have been identified , this sum@@ m@@ ary document should be sent to them , in order to prepare the first meeting .
it is therefore useful to prepare three or four sentences that can be used for a quick introduction during a first contact by phone or in person ( see the reference to the " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " in C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
indeed , at the start of the information map process , the objective is to initiate contact with persons identified before sending any explan@@ atory document .
surveys , feasibility studies , letters or e @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ ils are all good means of making a quick assessment , however , personal contact is essential to the success of any project .
people can facilitate or slow down the process , either because they find it interesting or because they feel threatened when sharing their data and possibly their responsibility .
personal contact in order to build confidence and trust is therefore vital at this stage in the process .
similarly , N@@ D@@ O key staff must meet contacts often , in order to identify and meet potential sources of expertise and ( hop@@ efully ) future partners .

information map
when launching the information map exercise :
( 1 ) identify key players ( 2 ) share your goals with them ( 3 ) organise a meeting to collect information
• S@@ end an explan@@ atory document so that your contacts can arran@@ ge meetings with potential sources of information and / or experts
• arran@@ ge meetings with several experts / institutions representatives at once : this will help you gather more information and will help people to get to know each other
why a national drug information system ?
by " system , " we mean a struc@@ tured organisation of het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous sources of information that is needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the drug situation .
the system describes sources and flows of information requested by the national reference framework .
the elements of this system are not bound necessarily by hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical relations and its financing does not come from a single source of funding .
at this stage we should make two ob@@ serv@@ ations :
• the process of construc@@ ting the system must be documented and monitored : this is the role of the national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS - see P . 46 ) .
the information map is a prerequisite to organising the national drug information system .
the next step is to imag@@ ine and propose a structure for data collection and reporting , which describes in detail the possible contribution expected from each stak@@ ehol@@ der and existing g@@ aps in the information available .
at this point , consulting and in@@ forming potential actors is vital , to ensure buy @@@ -@@ @ in and support .
the proposal should include a clear descri@@ ption of work processes and communication channels .
a comprehensive national drug information system should have two main components : a national data collection network and a national drugs observatory :
therefore the costs for establishing and maintaining a drug information system do not require a totally new budget .
this is more a question of artic@@ ulating and combin@@ ing various sources of information and funding , to identify where the g@@ aps are , and to look for potential comple@@ mentary solutions .
once the proposal for a national drug information system is ready , it has to be approved by the national authorities .
in some cases , co@@ operation protocols may need to be concluded between different institutions and the N@@ D@@ O .
this may also apply when experts from different institutions are going to take part in the work of the N@@ D@@ O , for instance for drafting the national report .
the next step of the process involves the preparation of a national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS ) , in which information is combined so as to identify objectives and actions to be undertaken .
the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS should give the guidelines for the work to be carried out over the years to come .
therefore , what matters here is to identify and estimate for the concrete actions that will be launched as additional resources become available .
the N@@ D@@ O and partners will then be able to seek resources at a later stage .
the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS should also include three comple@@ mentary tasks that are the responsibility of the national drugs observatory , according to its mandate and funding restrictions :
• D@@ ata collection : it is the responsibility of the N@@ D@@ O to identify g@@ aps and needs for additional data collection exercises , and to conv@@ ey this information to the national authorities .
according to available means , it may promote or even carry out new studies and surveys in order to bridge the knowledge gap .
the main aim is to ensure that any new survey or data collection exercise meets requirements and protocols presented in the national drug monitoring framework ;
for example , in the EU this can be carried out in the context of the national working groups that are often established for the implementation and development of each of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's five key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators ;
this is also where the N@@ D@@ O can be instr@@ um@@ ental in identi@@ fying extra funding opportunities from international organisations .
with the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS , the N@@ D@@ O and its partners identi@@ fies what needs to be done long @@@ -@@ @ term in order to implement the drug monitoring reference framework , using the information map as a starting point .
however it is important to bear in mind that kno@@ wing " what needs to be done " does not mean that everything can be done , or done at the same time : these are mer@@ ely long @@@ -@@ @ term goals .

what needs to be done
national action plan for the drug information system ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS )
once the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS is endorsed by its main stak@@ ehol@@ ders , then the N@@ D@@ O can prepare a ye@@ arly work programme .
in some countries , the two exercises ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS + annual work plan ) are merged into a single document .
1 4 many cases is not the N@@ D@@ O 's responsibility (
) Ul@@ ti@@ mately , the N@@ D@@ O can@@ not take responsibility for decisions that are out of its reach , but it can help influence relevant decisions .
• ( 1 ) Pre@@ par@@ e a proposal for a national drug information system , ( 2 ) get the national drug information system approved by national authorities , ( 3 ) prepare a national action plan ( NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS )
• Th@@ ink about the concrete out@@ puts and their re@@ lev@@ ance • Bu@@ ild a transparent system
• Partnership is all about networking and not a hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical or central@@ ised process - but money and mandate can help !
why establish a national network ?
networking and establishing partnerships serve four purposes :
• combin@@ ing sources of information / data ; • Po@@ ol@@ ing compet@@ ences and analysis and reporting capacity ; • sharing limited resources ;
• establishing a basis for the improvement of data avail@@ ability and quality , and for developing data analysis capacity .
the key principles under@@ pin@@ ning this work are :
equality of partners
all partners have the same rights and obligations , no pre @@@ -@@ @ emin@@ ence of any one in particular .
network = leadership + particip@@ ative management
the relationship between the partners is non @@@ -@@ @ hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical , but the network exists around a project which is co@@ ordinated under the leadership of the N@@ D@@ O .
it is the role of the N@@ D@@ O to keep the project on track , ste@@ ering the collabor@@ ative process towards a common goal .
respect of compet@@ ences , author@@ ship and ownership
contributions by partners , especially in deliver@@ ables produced by the N@@ D@@ O , should be acknowledged ; compet@@ ences available in the network should be used and recognised .
it is important that N@@ D@@ O staff know their own limits and build on comple@@ mentary expertise .
all authors and contribut@@ ors should be credi@@ ted in any reports published .
look for mutual benefit in the co@@ operation
the mandate and role of the N@@ D@@ O can@@ not ensure the participation of relevant experts alone , nor guarantee that the N@@ D@@ O receives quality data .
motiv@@ ation and participation can@@ not be comman@@ ded ; they are obtained through strong communication and clear mutual benefit .
communication is vital
a network lives because of the information exchange between its members .
for networks being established following the initiative or request of the N@@ D@@ O and / or the national authorities , the Co@@ ordination role of the N@@ D@@ O should be two @@@ -@@ @ way .
example of a national drug information network
in country X , a national drug information network could comb@@ ine institutions and resources such as :
• the Ministry of Health ( data on drug users in treatment , data on drug @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases )
• the Ministry of the Interior ( data on seiz@@ ures , price , quality , drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime )
• the Inter @@@ -@@ @ Minist@@ erial Dru@@ g Committee ( funding of N@@ D@@ O staff who co@@ ordinate the production of the national report and who ensure national reporting obligations are met )
• the World Bank or another international donor ( a general population survey and electronic data collection system on drugs users in treatment )
• other national organisations for some ad ho@@ c surveys and / or qual@@ it@@ ative studies among drug users • laborat@@ ories for the identification of new drugs and their consequences • the national drugs observatory in its role of co@@ ordinator of the whole network .
how to network ?
when possible , on the basis of the experts and institutions identified during the information map exercise , establish a national working group for each set of indicators and core data and for national reporting .
encourage and help these groups to define achiev@@ able objectives with the existing resources in order to ensure a ( better ) monitoring of the drugs situation in your country .
provide all national working groups with regular information about the activities and achievements of the other groups .
organise a national meeting every year or every two years where you present and discuss with them the national report and the data reported .
identify with them needs for improvements , per@@ spec@@ tives for new or better data collection and any other ad ho@@ c studies , and act as a facilit@@ ator for acc@@ essing information on possible sources of funding .
conven@@ tions or agreements can help to form@@ alise co@@ operation , but can@@ not replace partner motiv@@ ation .
this is one of the network 's critical roles ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 5 ) : it can help answer the question " how are we going to get where we want to be ? . "
bas@@ ically , the network helps to define and then trans@@ late the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS into reality .
figure 5 : the vital role of the national drug information network in the NA@@ P@@ D@@ IS
drug monitoring national reference framework
national drug information network
how to get there
what needs to be done
when creating a national drug information network :
• Pres@@ ent the missions of the N@@ D@@ O and the national drug information network : the ultimate goal is to meet national reporting obligations
• T@@ ry to be useful to them ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . provide information on potential sources of funding , grant applications to international organisations , relevant international conferences )
• T@@ ry to arran@@ ge a meeting every 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 years with your partners to share information , discuss the conclusions of your reports , and reflect about current trends .
in the European Union , best practice suggests having national working groups for fi ve key ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological indicators , national reporting and law enforcement indicators , when possible .
quality of the data (
quality assur@@ ance should be an integral part of a national action plan for a drugs information network , as long as it is realistic and takes into account available resources .
quality control means chec@@ king quality of the data against a set standard or specif@@ ic@@ ation@@ . cation .
ensuring quality is a big challenge for an N@@ D@@ O and may be at@@ tained by organising or facilitating training activities for N@@ D@@ O staff and partners , and by defining a clear quality assur@@ ance process .
the N@@ D@@ O has a key role in raising awareness on this issue with partners and driving a consensus on concrete steps to take in order to improve the quality of data collected .
) Qu@@ ality assur@@ ance is an organisation 's guarantee that the product or service it offers meets the accepted quality standards .
the N@@ D@@ O 's networking strategy may also help motiv@@ ate data providers to deliver quality data and further address the issue of quality as part of the data collection process .
how can you control and improve data quality ?
improving the quality of information on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues following an initial identification of potential problems or shortcomings may be achieved by establishing new sources of information , or capacity building .
in this task , the N@@ D@@ O may choose to use meth@@ od@@ ological materials available from specialised
16 organisations , such as the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , WHO , UNODC and others (
following this process , provide your partners with a fi nal report , sum@@ mar@@ ising the streng@@ ths and weaknesses of data quality , along with recommendations for changes and / or improvements .
ti@@ ps for N@@ D@@ O building (
when developing quality assur@@ ance :
• Parti@@ cip@@ ate in working groups and other networking events
• Li@@ a@@ ise with and / or take part in relevant international or regional expert meetings and sub@@ projects on this issue
• Car@@ ry out a formal review of data quality and avail@@ ability at national level with an expert panel • compar@@ e results with international guidelines and standards
remember that any progress in this area will depend on your capacity to build consensus !

how to analy@@ se the information collected ?
the objective of this core function is to interpre@@ t and present het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous data combin@@ ing quanti@@ t@@ ative and qual@@ it@@ ative information in order to give a comprehensive picture of the drugs situation .
this critical process should ent@@ ail the following :

more detailed information about statistical methods and about the specific protocols for data

it is also important that staff keep a record of all of the information related to the data used for any reporting .
common sources of quanti@@ t@@ ative drug data
government records and regist@@ ries
in most cases , these data are rout@@ in@@ ely collected .
another important category of data collected by national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories will come from surveys organised either peri@@ o@@ dic@@ ally or on ad ho@@ c basis .
it is important to assess whether such studies are using international stand@@ ardis@@ ed protocols and meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies .
AD ho@@ c studies can be surveys among specific groups of the population who are at high @@@ -@@ @ risk of drug use ( such as home@@ less people and prisoners ) or surveys on drug @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , for instance .
a survey is used to describe a situation in a population at a given point in time .
data collected in the area of " responses to the drug problem " may also fall within this group .
time series studies represent a special case and are a very interesting source of information .
• co@@ h@@ ort studies ( treatment co@@ hor@@ ts , birth co@@ hor@@ ts , special co@@ hor@@ ts ) ; • repeated cross @@@ -@@ @ sec@@ tional series e@@ .@@ g@@ . school surveys .

how to assess quanti@@ t@@ ative data
we will brief@@ ly describe here four groups of criteria for the assessment of quanti@@ t@@ ative information : defin@@ itions , represent@@ ati@@ veness , val@@ idity and reli@@ ability .
a defin@@ ition is a brief precise statement of what a word , question , measure or expression means .
the following questions may guide the N@@ D@@ O in this task :
• Ar@@ e there standard defin@@ itions and are they uni@@ form@@ ly applied geo@@ graph@@ ically and tempor@@ ally in the country ?
• Ar@@ e the reported meas@@ ure@@ ments clear and precise ( for instance not just " used can@@ na@@ bis " but " used can@@ na@@ bis 40 + times in lif@@ etime " ) ?
• Is the period used to describe the pre@@ val@@ ence consistent with standard protocols , and are the age groups defined in line with international standards ?
the conclusions need to be documented and included in the N@@ D@@ O 's data register .
when the N@@ D@@ O identi@@ fies problems on compati@@ bility of defin@@ itions and their application with international standards and protocols , it should explore with the data providers the reasons for these discre@@ pan@@ cies and try to find solutions .
a primary consideration for the N@@ D@@ O is whether the data collected is representative of the target population .
in relation to government statistics and regist@@ ries , the issue is whether the regist@@ ries cover the entire target population .
where sam@@ pling has been employed , the method of sam@@ pling can determine whether the samp@@ le is representative of the target population , or some sub@@ set ( 3 ) .
geographical coverage
is the national coverage real or does it cover all regions but only to some extent ?
is there information on local areas : city siz@@ es , cat@@ ch@@ ment areas , areas not covered , and can the geo@@ graphic coverage provide sub@@ national break@@ dow@@ ns ?
is the sam@@ pling representative only at national level or does it meet the criteria for sub@@ national areas ?
population coverage
are there known demographic pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar@@ ities present in the data source ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . minority groups ) ?
changes in coverage
do changes in coverage occur ?
additional comments on sam@@ pling
the most common distinc@@ tion between sam@@ pling methods is that between prob@@ abil@@ istic ( simple ran@@ dom sam@@ pling , str@@ ati@@ fied ran@@ dom sam@@ pling ... or some mi@@ x@@ ture there@@ of ) and non@@ prob@@ abil@@ istic methods ( pur@@ pos@@ ive sam@@ pling , snow@@ ball sam@@ pling ... ) .
central to which prob@@ abil@@ istic sam@@ pling method is employed is the avail@@ ability or not of a co@@ her@@ ent samp@@ le frame , or l@@ isting of the target population .
Pro@@ b@@ abil@@ istic methods , correc@@ tly implemented , allow gener@@ alis@@ ations to be made to the population listed in the samp@@ le frame , with statements of sam@@ pling er@@ ror in the form of confidence inter@@ vals .
N@@ on@@ prob@@ abil@@ istic sam@@ pling is used when a researcher wants to explore an experience , investigate a phenomenon or develop a new theory .
if in principle the study findings are to be gener@@ alis@@ able , it is necessary to ensure that the samp@@ le is representative .
this imp@@ lies that it is important for the N@@ D@@ O to have access not just to the numbers generated but also to information on the sam@@ pling method used and implementation of the survey .
val@@ idity
how can the val@@ idity of a study be assessed ?
when a study measures what it intended to measure it is valid .
different discipl@@ ines may make reference to different types of val@@ idity , however with quanti@@ t@@ ative studies , what is important to ensure is that :
• the measure is relevant to the study population ; • the measure is relevant to the experts in the subject ;
• the attitude assessment of the survey population can predict or agree with construc@@ ts external to attitude ;
• the answers cor@@ rela@@ te with other related construc@@ ts in the anticipated manner .
standard meth@@ od@@ ology tex@@ ts can be referred to for defin@@ itions (
are there any associated
see for example Car@@ mines , E@@ . G@@ . and Z@@ eller , R@@ . A. ( 1979 ) , " reli@@ ability and val@@ idity Ass@@ ess@@ ment , " S@@ age Pub@@ lic@@ ations , London .
while assessing the val@@ idity of the studies or surveys , special attention must be paid to possible bi@@ ases , or non @@@ -@@ @ ran@@ dom or systematic err@@ ors , entering into the data .
sources of bias may include sam@@ pling methods , question wor@@ ding , and interview techniques .
this criter@@ ion rela@@ tes to technical issues that may arise and that may have an impact on the study and bias the results .
for that purpose , ple@@ ase check :
• what was fore@@ seen in case of non @@@ -@@ @ response : possible bias and ass@@ ump@@ tions if ignored
• what checks were done on non @@@ -@@ @ respondents ?
was there any decision taken by the inter@@ viewers that may influence or affect the sam@@ pling method ?
analysis methods
comple@@ mentary information should be available regarding :
• descri@@ ption of the analysis if appropriate ; • descri@@ ption of the statistical or qual@@ it@@ ative software that was used .
do the authors use recognised and known scal@@ es ?
how is their val@@ idity and consist@@ ency evalu@@ ated ?
how were the inter@@ viewers recru@@ ited ?
what was the relationship between inter@@ vie@@ wer and respon@@ dent ( formal , official , friend , student , private market research ) .
who was present at the interview or during the questionnaire , and what was their status ( par@@ ent , school @@@ -@@ @ teacher , pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor , professional , or policeman ) ?
length , self @@@ -@@ @ completion and confi@@ denti@@ ality .
how is confi@@ denti@@ ality guaranteed , and what are the chances that it is perceived as guaranteed ?
indicators are approxim@@ ate and often im@@ perfect measures of the nature and extent of particular drug use @@@ -@@ @ related events or out@@ comes .
there is a need to system@@ atically check the quality of data sources as a prerequisite for their selection within a system .
quanti@@ ty of data sources used does not in itself provide a more valid system .
data sources reflect different aspects of the phenomenon .

statistical analysis
as already stated , the data provided to the N@@ D@@ O are often secondary .
this ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated data makes direct statistical analysis impossible .
this can , of course , limit the N@@ D@@ O 's ability to make statistical compar@@ is@@ ons between different groups or samples .
analy@@ sing and interpre@@ ting quanti@@ t@@ ative data require a sound knowledge of statistical analysis and of the most com@@ mon@@ ly used statistical software .
the N@@ D@@ O is expected to use its statistical knowledge to assess the conclusions of the reports and surveys that it has received , and / or to conduct or contribute to the statistical analysis of primary data .
scientific objec@@ tivity and independence are essential conditions for the legitimacy and credibility of the work of the N@@ D@@ O and its partners - any compromise would undermine the vi@@ ability of the whole system .
how to analy@@ se qual@@ it@@ ative information ?
how to make a correct interpre@@ tation ?
qual@@ it@@ ative data used by an N@@ D@@ O usually origin@@ ate from two different sources : Con@@ tex@@ tual information from key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts and formal qual@@ it@@ ative research studies .
such wide @@@ -@@ @ ranging information requires more flexible tools and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ ity for collection than is the case for quanti@@ t@@ ative data .
for instance , it can be collected by using struc@@ tured or semi @@@ -@@ @ struc@@ tured questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res .
this data can take the form of expert surveys , identi@@ fying and requ@@ esting information for those in the field with direct experience of the topic of interest .
qual@@ it@@ ative research gives us an opportunity to make sense of quanti@@ t@@ ative information , by further expl@@ oring :
• the social context ; • the social meaning of behaviour , and ; • behaviour as part of a wider social dynamic .
within the arena of drug use , qual@@ it@@ ative research has proved to be essential for :
• interpre@@ ting statistical data and placing it in context ; • providing in@@ sight into the problems and needs associated with a range of drug @@@ -@@ @ using pat@@ ter@@ ns ; • assessing the context in which interven@@ tions may be more effective ; and • helping to evaluate the drug users experience of interven@@ tions ; • understanding new drug using phenom@@ ena ; • providing in@@ sight into drugs markets .
the N@@ D@@ O plays an important role in making an invent@@ ory of such research results in its country , and in integr@@ ating these results in its analysis and reports .
it can also identify the areas where additional qual@@ it@@ ative research is needed , and launch a joint project with its partners if resources are available .
N@@ D@@ Os frequently face a situation in which they receive some limited quanti@@ t@@ ative information that is not sufficient per se to draw a clear and correct conclusion .
in such circumstances , a combination of both quanti@@ t@@ ative and qual@@ it@@ ative information can help them to build a more accur@@ ate or more comprehensive picture of the situation concerned .
while putting data into context , look for comple@@ mentary information , for instance :
inspired by Hil@@ le@@ brand , J@@ . , " assessing data quality , " Re@@ it@@ o@@ x academy specialised course , Thessaloniki , June 2004 ( un@@ published ) .
how to assess the quality of qual@@ it@@ ative studies
qual@@ it@@ ative research is characterised by a wide range of approaches and data collection techniques , and determining how to judge the quality of a qual@@ it@@ ative study will depend on the approach adopted .
efforts have been made to develop criteria within qual@@ it@@ ative research which are accepted broad@@ ly as re@@ pla@@ cements for what quanti@@ t@@ ative researchers call val@@ idity and reli@@ ability .
the strength of qual@@ it@@ ative research is that it addresses the relationship between the researcher and the research object , prec@@ lu@@ ding the no@@ tion of a common truth .
however , there are a few common aspects that should be considered :
• did the authors define a clearly formu@@ lated statement of the objectives of the research and what specific question it addressed ?
• W@@ as a qual@@ it@@ ative approach appropriate ?
• Ho@@ w were the sett@@ ings and the subjects selected ?
generally , qual@@ it@@ ative studies are not interested in an " average " - they gain an understanding of the experience of particular groups or individuals .
in any case , we need to understand how the samp@@ le was selected in order to understand the results and in order to draw conclusions .
• What methods were used and are these described in detail ?
describing methods is not an easy task in qual@@ it@@ ative research but you should be able to assess whether the methods were a sen@@ sible and adequate way of addressing the research question .
• What methods were used to analy@@ se the data ?
there are a broad range of qual@@ it@@ ative methods , each with their own specific meth@@ od@@ ological perspective .
• W@@ as attention given to the reli@@ ability of inter @@@ -@@ @ observers and to the val@@ idity of findings ?
for example , were the stre@@ et@@ workers involved in the interviews given training or a hand@@ book ?
• Ar@@ e the results credible ?
what conclusions were drawn and are they justified by the results ?
do the results meet expectations or are they contra@@ dic@@ tory :
• - with other parts of the study ; • - with the results of other studies performed in the same environment ?
when the information is based on key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts , the following issues deserve careful attention :
• What was the key in@@ for@@ man@@ t 's perspective ?
the information from key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts is never un@@ biased ; it is influenced by their position , their personal , political , or cultural interests : what is their motiv@@ ation ?
• W@@ as there more than one key in@@ for@@ man@@ t chosen ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . expert panel ) ?
how were they selected ?
• Key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts should be encouraged to disclose any specific interests that might influence their im@@ parti@@ ality .
when considering a qual@@ it@@ ative study ...
• What are the study objectives ?
• What type of study is it ( simple them@@ atic analysis , action research , gro@@ unded theory , phenom@@ en@@ ology , eth@@ no@@ graphy or other ) ?
• Do@@ es the author ( s ) reveal his / her view point ( s ) and discuss how his / her view point ( s ) may affect the study ?
• Wh@@ o auth@@ ored and who reviewed the study ?
• Wh@@ o published the study ? pe@@ er review journ@@ al , research institution or other ?
when using information provided by key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts ...
• What is the perspective and motiv@@ ation of the key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts ? • Ho@@ w were key in@@ for@@ man@@ ts selected ?
analy@@ ses of trends in the wider context
6 working @@@ -@@ @ day and se@@ as@@ onal vari@@ ation from a time series (
the social , demographic , econom@@ ical or political context may be used to explain related indicator data and / or trends .
some examples are :
• soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ demographic character@@ isti@@ cs ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . unemployment rate ) ;
• developments in the music culture ( increase in popularity of music cultures that are associated with drug consumption ) ;
• public health expendi@@ ture and priorities ( public expendi@@ ture or changes in the number of treatment units ) ;
• immigration / ethnicity ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . emer@@ gence of new drug use pat@@ ter@@ ns among immigrants that may affect local supply ) ;
• tourism ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . emer@@ gence of new drugs on the local market due to demand among tourists ) .
such studies can be used as additional sources of information , keeping in mind that the results can@@ not simply be transferred to other populations .
analy@@ ses of trends : err@@ ors , threats , and risk
reli@@ ability and val@@ idity challenges for drug trend monitoring systems or potential for er@@ ror , lie in two broad areas : at the level of individual sources and at the whole system level .
a type 1 er@@ ror means finding something that is not there would involve identi@@ fying a trend that does not exist .
a type 2 er@@ ror - missing something that is there - would involve a system failing to identify a new drug trend ( 7 ) .
identification of a non@@ ex@@ istent trend ( type 1 er@@ ror or false positi@@ ves ) : type 1 err@@ ors can be linked to data collection , analysis or reporting err@@ ors .
creating a new trend is the ultimate risk here .
failing to identify a trend ( type 2 er@@ ror or false neg@@ atives ) : type 2 err@@ ors , or failing to identify and report a new trend might be the result of poor data choice , or poor analysis techniques .
for example an over reli@@ ance on slow reporting methods is likely to lead to late reporting of a trend .
there is a specific risk that systems will mis@@ s emerging drug trends by not asking appropriate research questions .
slow developing trends are vulnerable here - very slight but continuous increases or decreas@@ es in consumption might never reach the reporting threshold , but in the longer term do constitute a significant change .
analy@@ ses of the relationship between different indicators
as mentioned before , an app@@ ra@@ is@@ al of the data quality for the indicators is of crucial importance .
the cross @@@ -@@ @ refer@@ ences made in the national report are there to present possible relationships between indicators taking into account other influ@@ ences and bi@@ ases .
mixed methods
a number of researchers have argued in favour of the use of mixed methods for drug trend
mixed methods sam@@ pling strategies involve the selection of units for a research study using both prob@@ ability sam@@ pling ( to increase external val@@ idity ) and pur@@ pos@@ ive sam@@ pling strategies ( to increase transfer@@ ability ) .
use of mixed methods requires attendance to bias chec@@ king procedures for each method .
10 detailed descri@@ ption and tri@@ an@@ gula@@ tion (
reporting and communic@@ ating should be seen as a critical function of the national drugs observatory , even if they are the result of a long process .
ultimately , producing and dis@@ semin@@ ating out@@ puts under@@ pin the N@@ D@@ O 's existence , as its out@@ puts substan@@ ti@@ ate its visi@@ bility both nation@@ ally and internationally .
to ensure sustainability and " buy @@@ -@@ @ in , " it is vital that the N@@ D@@ O ensu@@ res that it is perceived to be providing added value by its stak@@ ehol@@ ders and audiences - both at national and sup@@ ran@@ ational level .
in the long run , a failure to build visi@@ bility and to demonstrate the added value of the N@@ D@@ O will automatically have a negative impact on its credibility .
what should N@@ D@@ O out@@ puts contain ?
the objective is to use the results of data analysis and interpre@@ tation to answer stak@@ ehol@@ der questions .
this means that reports must be ta@@ il@@ ored in terms of content and form@@ at to the needs of the N@@ D@@ O 's stak@@ ehol@@ ders , or " clients . "
to reach this objective , the N@@ D@@ O needs to :
• make the added value of its out@@ puts a priority ;
• know its stak@@ ehol@@ ders and assess their needs ;
• go beyond the sole descri@@ ption of the past or present situation ;
• comply with international reporting procedures ;
• develop a strategy for communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination .
how to report at national level ?
this is one aspect of the N@@ D@@ O 's reporting that may sometimes be under@@ estimated , for instance when the focus of its work , or of its mandate , is to meet national reporting obligations of sup@@ ran@@ ational or international organisations .
the reporting activity should be oriented towards the " clients " or stak@@ ehol@@ ders : the content and the structure of the report or output , its form@@ at , its language and its level of detail are closely linked to those who will read it .
this means that ide@@ ally , for each output being produced , the N@@ D@@ O should define its objective , identify the target group , and select the relevant form@@ at .
the drafting process can only start after this preliminary analysis .
the challenge for the N@@ D@@ O is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that customers are satisfied .
this is no easy task .
information may be either comple@@ mentary or di@@ verg@@ ent ; for example , there may be a trade @@@ -@@ @ off when balan@@ cing national needs and international reporting obligations .
moreover , information needs may also be unclear or unknown .
it is difficult , for example , to assess ex an@@ te the information needs of customers of public services .
instead , it should be possible to use particip@@ ative techniques such as focus groups with sub@@ groups of end @@@ -@@ @ users to assess in detail the re@@ lev@@ ance of specific out@@ puts .
the danger for the N@@ D@@ O would be to decide without consultation what its audience needs , both in terms of content and of form@@ at .
it needs to ask those concerned what their needs are .
however , the N@@ D@@ O does have a role to propose out@@ puts and issues that may be of interest to the community : it must be pro@@ active .
objections may be raised that it is not within the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate to make such proposals , nor to take initiatives .
when planning out@@ puts and public@@ ations , the work of the N@@ D@@ O and its partners should comb@@ ine :
• A@@ n assessment of the information needs of its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national level , through regular dialogue with its direct " clients , " for instance by asking their fe@@ ed@@ back about their products
• A contribution to building common understanding of the national drugs situation between experts and for stak@@ ehol@@ ders .
to whom should we report at national level ?
what for ?
the N@@ D@@ O 's potential stak@@ ehol@@ ders and potential clients are decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , professionals working in the drugs field , the scienti@@ fi c community and the general public .
together they must be considered as customers for the N@@ D@@ O 's out@@ puts .
once the stak@@ ehol@@ ders have been identified , it is necessary for the N@@ D@@ O to make a first assessment of what could be their needs , how they could be met , and what are the resources / partnerships needed .
we would suggest the N@@ D@@ O clas@@ si@@ fies stak@@ ehol@@ ders in the following order of importance (
decis@@ ion@@ makers
decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , and more generally those who are sponsor@@ ing the N@@ D@@ O either directly or indirectly ; government and parliament representatives ; drug co@@ ordin@@ ators and officials responsible for implementing drug policy ; local government offici@@ al@@ s@@ . ci@@ als .
their decision has an impact on the existence of the national drugs observatory and on the investment in the national drugs information network .
they need highly sum@@ mar@@ ised , objective information on the national drugs situation in an international context and on drugs @@@ -@@ @ related issues of national interest .
more detailed information should be available upon request .
type of output needed
clear , short and simple information , always in the national language ( s ) and sometimes provided at short no@@ tice .
professionals working in the drugs field : treatment centres ; prevention and educational specialists ; out@@ reach workers , but also law enforcement professionals .
they are the N@@ D@@ O 's key partners and data providers ; they need to be motivated for maintaining or even increasing their contribution , and they should gain some benefit for their efforts .
their potential needs cover a broad range of information : external sources of funding for training and training materials , grants , et@@ c . ; national drugs situation in an international context ; international standards and meth@@ od@@ ological tools in their respective field of activity .
the information should be clear , with a level of detail that can be taken on board in their own practice , and provided in the national language ( s ) .
two additional groups could also be added to the list of stak@@ ehol@@ ders , although they are usually not the primary target for the N@@ D@@ O 's communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination strategy .
however , it might be considered useful if the N@@ D@@ O could u@@ til@@ ise information or data already produced for other purposes for the benefit of these two groups ;
researchers
these are researchers in the drugs field : University researchers and scientific staff ; research institu@@ tes ; field researchers in NGOs .
their work represents a significant part of the information being produced at national level , either to illu@@ str@@ ate the issue or to understand the ration@@ ale behind behavi@@ ours and attitudes .
an N@@ D@@ O contribution to their work could either be in the form of providing information or contributing to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of their research results .
the information should be comprehensive , very detailed and easily acces@@ sible .
this covers in particular those directly or indirectly confron@@ ted with the drugs issue : students , young people , drug users and their families .
making clear and under@@ stan@@ dable information available to the general public is part of their fundamental rights : it is also an obligation for organisations that are being established with public money .
is my child going to be affected ?
where can I go for help ?
the information should be clear , conc@@ ise , presented in simple terms , avoid sens@@ ation@@ alism and provide citizens with concrete solutions for seeking help or advice in their own language .
figure 6 : mat@@ ri@@ x of information needs showing content and form@@ at
form@@ at , level of detail
following such analysis , the national drugs observatory can then assess :
• the appearance and nature of N@@ D@@ O products and deliver@@ ables needed at national level , and
• how to use and form@@ at the results of data analysis and interpre@@ tation to match the needs of its different users .
the same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the form@@ at and content needs identified in the mat@@ ri@@ x .
know your national stak@@ ehol@@ ders and assess their needs :
sum@@ mar@@ ised information on specific issues , topics of interest : e@@ .@@ g@@ . policy bri@@ e@@ fin@@ gs , executive sum@@ m@@ ary of national reports .
professionals from the drugs fi eld
information covering a wide range of technical and meth@@ od@@ ological issues , struc@@ tured and well documented contents , in a not @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ detailed form@@ at ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a comp@@ il@@ ation of documents ) .
very detailed information , including raw data , on specific topics , allowing them to make their own analysis and interpre@@ tation .
why differ@@ enti@@ ate between analysis and reporting ?
are they not part of the same process ?
within the limits of its mandate , the N@@ D@@ O needs to explore how it can make its work and products more useful and more relevant for its national audience .
there are two comple@@ mentary ways to achieve this - by going beyond a simple descri@@ p@@ tive reporting approach , and by ta@@ il@@ oring the products to audience needs .
producing a report that goes beyond a simple descri@@ ption of the situation can be done either by being pro@@ active or by using the information available in a more cre@@ ative manner :
how can we present the results to our national authorities in a way that appeals to them ? "
in the first approach , additional information identified by the N@@ D@@ O may be needed , which may mean deciding how to obtain or produce the missing information .
this will then become a new project for the N@@ D@@ O and its partners .
a comple@@ mentary approach can be to cor@@ rela@@ te the information on the national situation together with the situation at regional or international level .
when the N@@ D@@ O produces reports and other out@@ puts , it should always be able to answer the ... " so what ? " question .
this leaves the re@@ ader asking " so what ? "
every time the answer to the " so what ? " question is not clear , it means that a product does not meet its objective or is not sufficiently well @@@ -@@ @ defin@@ ed@@ . ned .
make information relevant to national stak@@ ehol@@ ders :
• Fur@@ ther explore how to make the information collected useful and visible
• Be prospec@@ tive : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and per@@ spec@@ tives , or new risks
• Be cre@@ ative : what else can you do with the data gathered ?
D@@ on '@@ t just be descri@@ p@@ tive - present conclusions .
reporting to these organisations is somewhat easier in@@ so@@ far as the expected form@@ at and contents are given .
there are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
this is what we will describe brief@@ ly , starting with the UN reporting system , which is used worldwide .
United N@@ ations reporting system
the UN reporting system is managed by the United N@@ ations Office on Dru@@ gs and Crime ( UNODC ) .
" under the International Dru@@ g Control treaties , M@@ ember States are formally required to provide annually information on the working of the international drug control treaties .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Ann@@ ual Re@@ ports questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res ( AR@@ Q ) and it had been regularly reported to the CN@@ D ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
" review of the data collection process and prepar@@ atory activities for the development of a new annual report questionnaire .
revision of the mechanism for collecting and reporting information , " Meet@@ ing of the expert group on data collection , Vienna , 12 @@@ -@@ @ 15 January 2010 .
the AR@@ Q , which is currently under revision , is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the international data collection on drugs that in@@ forms UNODC 's global drug situation analy@@ ses and reporting .
the Commission on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs ( CN@@ D ) : is the central policy@@ making body of the United N@@ ations in drug @@@ -@@ @ related matters .
inter @@@ -@@ @ American Ob@@ ser@@ vatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID ) .
data collection takes place through two primary systems :
each of the protocols are stand@@ ardis@@ ed with the goal of producing information that is compar@@ able across countries .
• The C@@ IC@@ D@@ AT system to collect statistics on drug supply control ( uni@@ form statistical system on control of the supply area ) .
in addition , C@@ IC@@ AD carries out a tr@@ i @@@ -@@ @ annual evaluation process , known as the M@@ ulti@@ lateral E@@ valu@@ ation Mec@@ han@@ ism ( ME@@ M ) .
the ME@@ M is a pe@@ er review process in which the M@@ ember States evaluate each other on the progress of actions taken to combat the hem@@ is@@ ph@@ er@@ ic drug problem .
the information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comp@@ rise the ME@@ M In@@ str@@ ument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
in addition to fulfilling the ME@@ M instrument each country prepares an intro@@ duc@@ tory nar@@ r@@ ative document to con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alise the information provided in the instrument .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA national reporting package has three elements : a national report , statistical tables and struc@@ tured questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res .
• they are used to build a European picture , to analy@@ se the situation and the evol@@ ution of the phenomenon and responses ;
international monitoring systems - common challenges
• these monitoring systems depend heavily on the quanti@@ ty and quality of the information provided by their respective M@@ ember States - this information needs to be accur@@ ate , provided on time , and reliable ;
• evaluation is generally separated from data collection , but data collection is essential to fe@@ ed the evaluation process , which in turn fe@@ eds into decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
at this stage , two tasks are of crucial importance :
when reporting to or for a sup@@ ran@@ ational or international organisation :
• clar@@ ify the process for delivery and identify the end benef@@ i ciary of your report ( the international organisation itself , or the national co@@ ordinating entity , or the Ministry of Health , or the national drugs co@@ ordinating body , et@@ c . )
• Def@@ i ne be@@ fore@@ hand a scienti@@ fi c and institutional val@@ idation process ( scienti@@ fi c committee , pe@@ er review , et@@ c . )
• Mak@@ e sure you provide the data and other national reporting packages on time
• Be fac@@ tual and neutral , do not exceed your role : the N@@ D@@ O 's credibility reli@@ es on its objec@@ tivity , not the political opinions of its staff
• En@@ sure that the information sent out has been appropri@@ ately val@@ idated .
integr@@ ating dis@@ sem@@ ination into a communication strategy
after a needs analysis comes the time for cho@@ ices , according to the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate and its available resources .
this is why it is important to draw a stak@@ ehol@@ der strategy taking into account N@@ D@@ O resources , the avail@@ ability of data and priorities .
indeed , the long @@@ -@@ @ term challenge for the N@@ D@@ O is to provide answers to information needs and to ensure that its various " clients " are satis@@ fi@@ ed@@ . ed .
how to organise communication with the media
in relation to communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination , particular attention should be paid to a special group of customers : media professionals .
the next step is to consider whether the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
however , in the 21 century , communication can@@ not be reduced to whether this happens with or without the media .
a more appropriate question would be " how can we integrate work with media professionals in the national drug observatory 's communication strategy , within the limits of its re@@ mit ? "
this does not prevent the head of the N@@ D@@ O answ@@ ering requests for information from journalists , but the internal procedure could imply li@@ a@@ ising with the press relations officer of the host institution .
in countries where the N@@ D@@ O is established as a separate institution , communication with the media may be a shared responsibility with the national drug co@@ ordinating body , as shown in the following example ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 7 ) :
when the N@@ D@@ O is about to produce a new output , it either sends a preliminary confi@@ dential note to the national drug co@@ ordinating body ( N@@ DC ) - if relevant - or trans@@ mits the information through the normal channels .
the main concern here is to ensure that the political powers are informed in advance of any up and coming " hot " topics .
the N@@ DC usually trans@@ mits the report to its own communication department .
the information , press release ( s ) and various information packages are then placed on the Internet and the websites of the two institutions involved .
when relevant , the national drug co@@ ordinating body may decide to include the information in a national advertising campaign .

in this chapter , we propose some tools for making a strategic diagnos@@ is of the N@@ D@@ O with reference to its institutional challenges , bearing in mind that each situation is unique .
our approach will focus on three key strategic factors ( K@@ S@@ F@@ s ) to be considered in order to ensure the N@@ D@@ O 's sustainability .
institutional issues are only one of the challenges faced by an N@@ D@@ O : the core operations are what give the sub@@ stance and legitimacy of the work of national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories .
these were presented in detail in the previous chapter .
the diagnos@@ is should ide@@ ally be based on facts and figures .
defin@@ ition
a key strategic factor defin@@ es a structural character@@ istic of the organisation and of its
1 ) : environment which is essential in order to achieve its goals and objectives (
" we in@@ ven@@ ted the term " strategic factors " to cover items not previously identified separately .
strategic factors describe those few things that an organisation or business unit has to get right in
2 order to succeed with its key stak@@ ehol@@ ders " (
as N@@ D@@ Os are usually established within public institutions or with public funds , for the purpose of our analysis we will use meth@@ od@@ ological tools and concep@@ ts developed to study strategic management in public services .
see : h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ strate@@ g@@ ic@@ fac@@ tor@@ s@@ .com / Ken@@ ny , G@@ . , " stak@@ ehol@@ ders and Strategic Management , " presented at the US Academy of Management Conference , Atlanta 11 @@@ -@@ @ 16 August , 2006 .
we refer in particular to a study published by Al@@ ford in 2001 , in which he presents a few character@@ isti@@ cs that can apply to N@@ D@@ Os ( we ital@@ ic@@ ise ) :
• the organis@@ ational capabilities that are involved in the production process are not exclusively based within a single institution , but are depending from different institutions and partners ( co @@@ -@@ @ production ) " ( 3 ) .
as far as the situation of the N@@ D@@ O is concerned , we observe that :
• N@@ D@@ O production depends on its co@@ operation with other national sources of information and of expertise , in most of the cases it can@@ not work on its own ( co @@@ -@@ @ production )
• the N@@ D@@ O buil@@ ds its capacity on the basis of di@@ verse resources and partners , at national , local and sup@@ ran@@ ational level ( combined resources )
• these key factors are inter@@ connected and inter @@@ -@@ @ dependent .
based on the above , we propose considering the following as key strategic factors for the strategic diagnos@@ is of a national drugs observatory : perceived value , co @@@ -@@ @ production and combined resources .
the N@@ D@@ O 's position in terms of these strategic factors must be assessed :
• when it is set up , in order to identify existing resources and means , as well as clar@@ ify the mandate for its establishment ;
• at any time during the N@@ D@@ O 's existence to assess its situation and take appropriate measures to ensure its sustainability .
KSF 1 - perceived added value
bearing in mind the N@@ D@@ O 's situation , we can say that :
• the value of its work is quite complex to assess , as it is a response to a political decision that affects the country as a whole , including reporting obligations ;
• the value of the N@@ D@@ O 's work is not always meas@@ ur@@ able - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and out@@ puts ;
• the value of the N@@ D@@ O 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
• most importantly , even if the N@@ D@@ O was established to meet some international obligations , if can@@ not fulfil its role if it does not answer national needs .
at this point , try not to think in one dimension .
to conclude : try to identify and define the N@@ D@@ O 's perceived or potential added value from the point of view of its audience / stak@@ ehol@@ ders , rather than from one of its promo@@ ters ( see box below ) .
what are you doing ? , " when asked by a decision @@@ -@@ @ maker :
( the famous " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " can be a good way of preparing for this situation , or think of the " so what ? " we talked about earlier ) ;
• use v@@ ague administrative or scientific terms , such as
note : an " ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch " ( or ele@@ vat@@ or speech ) is an over@@ view of an idea for a product , service , or project .
the name reflects the fact that an ele@@ vat@@ or pit@@ ch can be delivered in the time sp@@ an of an ele@@ vat@@ or ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 50 @@@ -@@ @ 100 words ) .
to support the perceived value of the N@@ D@@ O , we propose using three categories of criteria to identify additional actions / measures : added value of N@@ D@@ O 's products , credibility , and relations with its audiences and stak@@ ehol@@ ders .

out@@ puts : is the N@@ D@@ O producing only one report per year ?
what is its content and form@@ at ?
is this report published in the national language ( s ) and is it dis@@ semin@@ ated at national level ?
is the N@@ D@@ O producing more targeted products for well identified groups or sub@@ groups of " clients " ?
are the N@@ D@@ O 's products published only for a specific purpose or are there comple@@ mentary public@@ ations targeting non @@@ -@@ @ specialised audiences ?
quality : are the N@@ D@@ O 's reports considered good quality ?
are the N@@ D@@ O 's products perceived as easy to understand by decis@@ ion@@ makers and the general public ?
is the general image of N@@ D@@ O 's public@@ ations more of a scientific authority or is it perceived as being influenced by political or ide@@ ological consider@@ ations ?
visi@@ bility : how would you assess the N@@ D@@ O 's visi@@ bility ?
do the main existing or potential stak@@ ehol@@ ders know about its existence and do they know what they can ask the N@@ D@@ O ?
is the N@@ D@@ O considered as the main or one of the main refer@@ ences for drug @@@ -@@ @ related information in the country ?
General and ad ho@@ c requests : does any@@ body ask the N@@ D@@ O for standard or ad ho@@ c requests ?
is the N@@ D@@ O promoting itself as the reference organisation that can ta@@ il@@ or information according to the needs of its customers ?
relations with audience ( s ) and stak@@ ehol@@ der ( s )
promotion : does the N@@ D@@ O have established formal / informal relations with its audience / stak@@ ehol@@ ders ?
is the N@@ D@@ O trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
is there any policy within the N@@ D@@ O to identify existing or potential needs for drug @@@ -@@ @ related information among its audiences and its stak@@ ehol@@ ders ?
media relations : how would you character@@ ise the N@@ D@@ O 's relations with the media ?
does the N@@ D@@ O have a public relations ( PR ) policy and a PR officer ?
can the N@@ D@@ O communicate directly with media ?
do newspapers and journalists know the N@@ D@@ O exists and do they refer to its reports and public@@ ations ?
do they spon@@ tane@@ ously contact the N@@ D@@ O when they need some information on the drugs issue in the country or abroad ?
KSF 2 - Co @@@ -@@ @ production
what does co @@@ -@@ @ production , or " collabor@@ ative production " mean for an N@@ D@@ O ?
it means that the N@@ D@@ O usually depends on existing sources of information and expertise available in the country to produce its own deliver@@ ables .
in fact , in many cases , most of the N@@ D@@ O 's products are the result of partnerships and co@@ operation , and external expertise may be needed also to val@@ idate its analy@@ ses and reports .
to be involved almost permanently in a co @@@ -@@ @ production process has very important consequences when organising the N@@ D@@ O 's work .
• establish a partnership with existing sources of information and national experts , both for data collection purposes and for developing reporting capacity ;
• ensure that its partners der@@ ive mutual benefit from the data collection and reporting system : it is important partners are motivated to provide the data , as this has an impact on the quality of the data collected ;
• realise that national monitoring capacity is the combination of different resources rather than their concentration ;
• take into account the fact that compet@@ ences and responsibilities are increasingly being transferred from central to regional or local level in many countries .
this creates a greater need for conver@@ gence between co @@@ -@@ @ production activities .
to support assessing the N@@ D@@ O 's situation in terms of co @@@ -@@ @ production , we propose considering three categories of criteria for diagnos@@ is : operating framework , reporting procedures and out@@ puts .
operating framework
operating framework
information map : is an information map drafted and permanently up@@ dated so as to identify any source of expertise and information available in the country , and is there any communication policy ge@@ ar@@ ed towards the strategic partners ?
established partnerships : describes the N@@ D@@ O 's operating framework with the key sources of expertise and information in the country .
is there a formal partnership agreement between the main data providers and the N@@ D@@ O ?
relations with data providers : does the N@@ D@@ O have regular meetings with its data providers ?
are the data providers informed about the events / decisions / activities organised by the N@@ D@@ O at national or at sup@@ ran@@ ational level ?
are there provisions for sharing the results of the co@@ operation ?
national reports : does the N@@ D@@ O draft its report ( s ) alone or in consultation / co@@ operation with national experts ?
are the reports presented to national experts and to national data providers so as to ensure ownership of the results and a confron@@ tation of the results of the data analysis with the experience of professionals working in the field ?
national working groups : are national working groups of experts established for relevant groups of indicators and for national reporting ?
do these working groups meet regularly and try to improve the instruments and also data clar@@ ity ?
is any fe@@ ed@@ back given to the institutions and professionals collecting the information in the field ?
content : do contents of reports and other public@@ ations reflect the need for a M@@ ulti@@ disciplinary and multi@@ fac@@ eted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
do the N@@ D@@ O 's projects and out@@ puts give a balanced view of the drugs phenomenon , addressing both demand and supply issues ?
quality assur@@ ance : is there shared responsibility for quality assur@@ ance and quality control ?
are there any quality control procedures before a report is published ?
mutual benefits : is the N@@ D@@ O completely isolated ?
are there institutions challenging or even con@@ testing its legitimacy ?
does the N@@ D@@ O acknowledge the value and compet@@ ences of other institutions already working in the field ?
do partnerships offer mutual benefit to the institutions involved ?
is the N@@ D@@ O playing a role in the exploitation and promotion of existing resources at local and at national level ?
is the N@@ D@@ O managing to provide something useful to its partners in exchange for their data and / or expertise ?
KSF 3 - Com@@ bin@@ ed resources
human and financial resources are frequently presented as the starting point for any project .
here again , we suggest being less self @@@ -@@ @ focused .
the main priority for the promo@@ ter or N@@ D@@ O head is und@@ oub@@ tedly funds and human resources .
this means he / she will tend to promote the " institution . "
however , those cont@@ acted for funds need to see why they should give money to an N@@ D@@ O instead of something else .
this means promoting the " expected results and benefits " in any written or spoken proposal .
there is also a more emp@@ iri@@ cal reason for this approach .
N@@ D@@ Os are not created out of th@@ in air in a vac@@ u@@ um .
there are already at least some institutions and professionals on the field who have information , data and / or expertise on the drugs phenomenon .
there are three under@@ lying principles that support this approach :
• more can always be achieved when resources are poo@@ led ;
the N@@ D@@ O can only receive or benefit from other partners " resources if it turns itself into a resource for them .
to describe this KSF , a broader range of topics than just the N@@ D@@ O 's budget should be considered .
this is why we propose three categories : institutional support , operational capacity , scientific capacity .
figure 10 : KSF 3 - Com@@ bin@@ ed resources
N@@ D@@ O mandate and status : do politicians and other decis@@ ion@@ makers fully support the project to set up an N@@ D@@ O ?
is there any binding resolution from the national authorities on their own or in relation to any sup@@ ran@@ ational organisation that supports setting up the N@@ D@@ O and the national data collection network ?
reporting and status of N@@ D@@ O products : has a mechanism for evalu@@ ating the work of the N@@ D@@ O and its out@@ puts been fore@@ seen ?
is the N@@ D@@ O expected to provide decis@@ ion@@ makers with
does the work of the N@@ D@@ O contribute to national reporting obligations ?
does the N@@ D@@ O have a specific and exp@@ li@@ cit role in the national strategy document aimed at providing the evidence needed to monitor the implementation and evaluation of this national strategy ?
staff and budget : is there a specific budget adopted on a ye@@ arly basis or an ad ho@@ c non @@@ -@@ @ rec@@ ur@@ rent funding for specific activities ?
is the mission and work of the N@@ D@@ O described in a ye@@ arly work programme with staff assigned exclusively to the N@@ D@@ O on a full @@@ -@@ @ time basis ?
does the N@@ D@@ O have a strategy to li@@ a@@ ise with national authorities to maintain or increase the level of investment in the drug @@@ -@@ @ related data collection system ?
networking and partnerships : is there any national expertise that could comple@@ ment the expertise available at the N@@ D@@ O , and if so is there any formal mechanism or project to facilitate co@@ operation with the experts concerned ?
budget for rout@@ ine and ad ho@@ c data collection : are budgets available in other institutions and ministries for rout@@ ine data collection ?
is there any specific or general programme at state level that includes a provision for commission@@ ing ad ho@@ c studies , research or surveys to which the N@@ D@@ O can apply ?
does the country co@@ operate with - and have access to - funding from international or sup@@ ran@@ ational organisations such as the EU , UNODC , WHO , O@@ AS , CAR@@ IC@@ OM or the Global Fund ?
data and information : are there any drug @@@ -@@ @ related data that are rout@@ in@@ ely collected at national or local level ?
are there plans for new rout@@ ine data collection that would totally or partially meet international standards ?
what is the feasibility and lik@@ elihood to prepare and present new projects for rout@@ ine data collection ?
what are the obstacles and what are the possible solutions ( financial , meth@@ od@@ ological , et@@ c . ) ?
are the main groups of indicators and other sets of core data available in the country ?
what are the realistic per@@ spec@@ tives for an improvement of the situation ?
is there anything that can be done at a reasonable cost to prepare their implementation ?
scientific and professional expertise : are there any drug @@@ -@@ @ related research activities in the country that could provide some information on the drugs situation , or that could benefit from the support and co@@ operation with the N@@ D@@ O ?
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book of their clients , needs assessments or programmes / projects evalu@@ ations that could be useful to understand the situation ?
this becomes a sound base for preparing a strategic plan for the development of the national drugs observatory .
a strategic plan aims to make sure that the N@@ D@@ O will consolidate or improve its situation and will maxim@@ ise its position as regards the three key strategic factors , which could be sum@@ mar@@ ised as follows :
• to ensure more perceived added value from its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national and at local level ;
• to improve and to diversi@@ fy the co @@@ -@@ @ production scheme so as to produce better products which are ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of its different client groups ;
• to better comb@@ ine the resources from national and local level , both in terms of data and of expertise , so as to consolidate the co @@@ -@@ @ production processes and the quality of public@@ ations and other out@@ puts .
the analy@@ tical framework proposed is dynamic and flexible : there is no single model for N@@ D@@ Os that should be applied in@@ distinc@@ tly to any country and to any situation .
what matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
in the current context of general soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic difficulties , one should avoid the temp@@ tation of presenting exagger@@ ated objectives and excessive requests for funding .
these will not only be refused by the decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , but will also give the N@@ D@@ O and its promo@@ ters a negative image that might prove fatal for the organisation 's survival .
however , when preparing the strategic plan , we recommend limiting the information to the objectives and the actions to be undertaken , which is the critical information for the cho@@ ices to be made .
indeed , the strategic diagnos@@ is and the strategic plan are tools that support decision @@@ -@@ @ making at N@@ D@@ O and stak@@ ehol@@ der level : the better the information , the easier the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process .
however , these tools are based on a pre @@@ -@@ @ requ@@ isite : do think about what you can already do with what you and your partners have , D@@ on '@@ T say " I can@@ not do anything until I get more . "

the table above gives an over@@ view of the N@@ D@@ O and its national drug information network 's main goals .
it should be prepared on the basis of objective and reliable information , ensuring balance and giving links between the three key strategic factors .
where should the national drugs observatory be located ?
what legal status should it have ?
what should the scope of its mandate be ?
in this chapter we will present and provide some elements of response to common questions frequently asked about national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories , and to which there is usually no single answer .
if you have more , ple@@ ase e @@@ -@@ @ mail your question to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA or C@@ IC@@ AD at : info @ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u and O@@ ID _ C@@ IC@@ AD @ o@@ as@@ .@@ org@@ .
options for consideration
this depends on how decision @@@ -@@ @ making is organised in your country .
here are examples of existing situations :
• within national drug Co@@ ordination bodies or under government departments ; • within the Ministry of Health or within the National Institute for Public Health ; • within the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security ; • within a university or a non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisation .
streng@@ ths and weaknesses
however , if too close politically , the N@@ D@@ O 's scientific credibility and objec@@ tivity and even long @@@ -@@ @ term stability may be challenged .
if the N@@ D@@ O is located within or under the Ministry of Health , this is usually very beneficial when collecting data on health and social issues , but less effective for supply and supply reduction data .
the capacity of developing a comprehensive analysis of the drugs situation ( = beyond specific public health issues ) is not always guaranteed .
it is important to ensure that co@@ operation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the supply side .
if the N@@ D@@ O is located within or under the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior , Home Affairs , Justice or National Security , this offers more opportunities to obtain data on supply
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book and supply reduction , but less on social and health issues .
the capacity of developing a comprehensive analysis of the drugs situation ( = beyond specific law enforcement compet@@ ence ) is not always guaranteed .
it is important to ensure that co@@ operation mechanisms exist to bridge the gap with the sources of data and expertise from the demand side .
however , sometimes the N@@ D@@ O remains too far from decision @@@ -@@ @ makers , lacks visi@@ bility and institutional support of its role at national level .
most of the existing national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories have the following in common :
• their work is defined by some terms of reference , either as a single entity or as a unit / section within a bigger institution .
if the N@@ D@@ O is established at a too low structural and hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical level within an existing institution , this presents the same dis@@ advantages and also gives no visi@@ bility to the N@@ D@@ O and its products .
it then becomes extremely difficult for the N@@ D@@ O to fulfil its mandate and address the needs of its stak@@ ehol@@ ders at national level .
this can serve as a basis for assessing its performance at the end of the period .
the latter may be observed in cases where the interest of some professionals may lie more with the institution 's position than its performance .
the legal status can be extremely useful to form@@ alise the inter @@@ -@@ @ institutional and Inter@@ agency co@@ operation as it " obli@@ ges " third parties to respect and recognise the N@@ D@@ O 's role .
the following two options should be considered :
• limiting the scope of the N@@ D@@ O 's work to illi@@ cit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of sup@@ ran@@ ational and international organisations such the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and UNODC ;
if the N@@ D@@ O 's scope is extended to li@@ cit substan@@ ces , this gives an excellent opportunity to build a comprehensive image of complex social and individual behavi@@ ours linked to addi@@ ction .
it can also provide the opportunity to observe and analy@@ se possible cor@@ relations between
building a national drugs observatory : a joint hand@@ book trends of use .
however , this also makes the work of the N@@ D@@ O more complex , both from an organis@@ ational and scientific perspective .
if the objectives and expected results are real@@ isti@@ cally and clearly defined , whatever the scope of the N@@ D@@ O 's mandate , all work must be productive and relevant .
in all situations , the resources that the N@@ D@@ O is allocated to do its job must be consistent with the scope of its mandate .
to address this issue , one should consider the following :
• The national drugs observatory 's technical compet@@ ence should ide@@ ally mir@@ ror the wide range of subject areas covered by its scope and mandate ;
• The technical and scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how of the N@@ D@@ O and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• Scientific background : the team in the N@@ D@@ O should have the necessary skills to cover all aspects of the monitoring and reporting framework .
main pro@@ files could therefore include : E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ologist , sociologist , psych@@ ologist or other social scientist , to@@ x@@ ic@@ ologist , statisti@@ cian , crimin@@ ologist and policy analyst ;
• manag@@ erial and communication skills : General management , communication and networking , edi@@ ting and dis@@ sem@@ ination as well as secre@@ tar@@ ial support are all likely to be needed ;
• At least half of the staff should have a certain degree of professional experience and prefer@@ ably clear scientific qualifications .
• The N@@ D@@ O needs to attract and to keep competent staff , and it needs to be stable so as to ensure both its scientific capacity and the quality of its processes and deliveries ;
• E@@ ach country should find the structure and organisation that matches best with sup@@ ran@@ ational and international reporting tasks and the national context ;
• Some countries with very limited resources have no choice but to start with one person .
if the N@@ D@@ O is a rather small unit , this should be compen@@ sa@@ ted with formal agreements for the secon@@ d@@ ment of the missing scientific resources .
1 number of staff falls under three full @@@ -@@ @ time posts or their equivalent (
) , the N@@ D@@ O can@@ not fulfil its tasks .
if the N@@ D@@ O is established as a small unit , it often ten@@ ds to rely too heavily on external expertise and sometimes poorly @@@ -@@ @ organised national networks .
with a team that is too small , management and networking activities that are critical for the N@@ D@@ O become a real challenge .
if the N@@ D@@ O is given an important national mandate as an observatory , this imp@@ lies that the compet@@ ences required need to cover the full range of core functions as described in chapters 3 to 5 .
if this is the case , special attention must be paid to institutional relations and co@@ operation , and to communication and public relations .
in order to provide policymakers with a comprehensive picture of the budgetary and financial implications involved in setting up an N@@ D@@ O , the national drugs observatory and national drugs information network must be considered together .
the estimated cost should be based on an assessment of the following criteria :
• The running costs of the N@@ D@@ O in terms of staff and operations , including meetings with national and international partners ;
• specific costs associated to the mission and tasks of the N@@ D@@ O , spread along the three key operating processes : data collection , analysis and interpre@@ tation , reports and public@@ ations ;
• In some cases it may be relevant to make a distinc@@ tion between costs for national and international obligations ;
• It may be necessary to draft financial plans that set ye@@ arly running costs .
however , in the beginning , the estimated cost of the national drugs information network will not be known , and the N@@ D@@ O will not usually start by immediately collecting data through a national survey .
this means that the budget can be more limited for the first year of activity .
however , budgetary objectives for years two and three should be considered , at least as a reasonable perspective ( 2 ) ;
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ D@@ O 's capacity to deliver out@@ puts and be accountable for the use of funds .
this means that either in the N@@ D@@ O or its host institution there must be someone with sound administrative and financial management skills ;
this means that some may be working in different institutions and secon@@ ded to the N@@ D@@ O@@ .@@ When the N@@ D@@ O is based within a public body , budgetary per@@ spec@@ tives and commitments usually can@@ not exceed one year .
a su@@ dden change or im@@ balance in the N@@ D@@ O 's finances during an operational year is extremely dam@@ ag@@ eable to both the N@@ D@@ O and its network .
this may also affect the delivery of the out@@ puts to sup@@ ran@@ ational and international organisations , which may have negative consequences for the country 's reputation .
when this issue is discussed , avoid conf@@ usion between " scientific quality , " and " institutional autonomy , " which are two different things .
• Scientific quality is extremely important to ensure that the data are correc@@ tly presented and interpreted , that they are true and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy , and that they meet international standards .
the objective of this review is to ensure that there are neither mistakes nor any mis@@ interpre@@ tation of the data , and to val@@ idate the publication .
this in turn gives more legitimacy to the N@@ D@@ O .
there should be no compromise on the quality of the N@@ D@@ O 's out@@ puts .
• In@@ stitu@@ tional autonomy ref@@ ers to something different : the N@@ D@@ O should be preserved from external attempts to transform data , give false information , encourage propaganda or political correc@@ t@@ ness .
the N@@ D@@ O is primarily operational in the area of information and is not involved in politics .
at the same time , the N@@ D@@ O must define and to keep a position in relation to other institutions or key actors in the country .
a situation where the scientific quality of the N@@ D@@ O 's work is tain@@ ted is unacceptable .
despite possible attempts to dis@@ gu@@ ise interference , it is usually detec@@ ted by international organisations .
this is harmful for the reputation of the country concerned .
if the N@@ D@@ O is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
as already mentioned , the N@@ D@@ O needs to pay special attention to avoid crossing institutional and compet@@ ence boundaries .
national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories may contribute to the evaluation of national drug policies or of specific aspects of national strategies , at the request of their respective national authorities .
however , to make this possible and relevant , a few principles need to be respected :
• there should be an official request addressed to the N@@ D@@ O by its national authority , indicating the scope and the objectives of the evaluation ;
the same applies to the expertise needed to conduct the evaluation ;
• the N@@ D@@ O should reserve the right to accept - or to propose a technical modi@@ fication in order to accept - to perform the evaluation ;
• the N@@ D@@ O 's contribution to the evaluation should be on scientific grounds ( fac@@ tual , neutral , objective , reliable ) and should avoid making political conclusions that are the re@@ mit of national authorities ;
• the N@@ D@@ O should clar@@ ify what are the questions of the evaluation for which there is no evidence available .
when the scope of the work carried out by the N@@ D@@ O within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the N@@ D@@ O .
however there have been situations in which despite these precau@@ tions , some political actors have accused the N@@ D@@ O of a lack of objec@@ tivity and of being " politically oriented " - if not , providing " false " data .
this is why all of the N@@ D@@ O 's actions linked to any evaluation must be scienti@@ fic@@ ally sound and well documented .
international assistance , provided either during the evaluation , for instance in a scientific ste@@ ering committee or for a pe@@ er review may also help counter such potential negative reactions .
it usually also helps to better define objectives , and to better identify existing and new data needed for measuring the performance or the impact of some measures .
what comes next ?
how can we trans@@ late theory into practice ?
through the different chapters and sections of this hand@@ book , the re@@ ader has been given a comprehensive presentation of national drugs obser@@ vat@@ ories , in particular :
• a clear defin@@ ition of what is an observatory , its mission and objectives ;
• a detailed presentation of its three core functions which are : data collection and monitoring ; data analysis and interpre@@ tation ; reporting and dis@@ sem@@ ination ;
• an introduction to strategic diagnos@@ is based on three key strategic factors ( K@@ S@@ F@@ s ) and their related criteria - perceived added value , co @@@ -@@ @ production and combined resources ;
• and finally , a suggestion of some options to be considered when setting up a national drugs observatory , with the main streng@@ ths and weaknesses of each option .
the time has now come to develop your own vision and to take this forward into practice .
as you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
taking on board the ideas , concep@@ ts and experiences that have been shared with you in this hand@@ book , you must now build a vision of what your national drugs observatory should be like .
one last suggestion : use the processes and expected out@@ puts as a starting point and build a system and a network around them .
there are no institutional models to be cop@@ ied - it is all about bringing people together to work towards a common goal .

about the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA
about C@@ IC@@ AD @@@ -@@ @ O@@ AS
the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Dru@@ g Ab@@ use Control Commission ( C@@ IC@@ AD ) was established by the General Assembly of the Organ@@ ization of American States ( O@@ AS ) in 1986 as the western hem@@ is@@ phere 's policy forum on all aspects of the drug problem .
the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) is the hub of drug @@@ -@@ @ related information in Europe .
its mission is to provide the EU and its M@@ ember States with " fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information " on drugs , drug addi@@ ction and their consequences .
established in 1993 , it opened its doors in Lisbon in 1995 and is one of the EU 's decentral@@ ised agencies .
with a 100 @@@ -@@ @ strong M@@ ulti@@ disciplinary team , the agency offers policymakers the evidence base they need for drawing up drug laws and strategies .
it also helps professionals and researchers pin@@ point best practice and new areas for analysis .
as well as gathering information on the demand and reduction of the demand for drugs , the agency in recent years has extended its monitoring and reporting on drug supply , supply reduction and illi@@ cit drug markets .
data collection in the C@@ IC@@ AD system takes place within the context of the Inter @@@ -@@ @ American Ob@@ ser@@ vatory on Dru@@ gs ( O@@ ID ) .

the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) is the hub of drug @@@ -@@ @ related information in the European Union .
Al@@ sos@@ er@@ ved are professionals and researchers working in the drugs field and , more broad@@ ly , the European media and general public .
one of the agency 's key aims is to ren@@ der drug information more compar@@ ab@@ le@@ across Europe .
this allows countries to ga@@ uge how they fit into the wider European picture and examine common problems and responses to drugs .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA works on the ass@@ umption that sound information is the key to@@ an effective strategy on drugs .
although the Centre can@@ not propose any kin@@ d@@ of policy model , it is now making a clear impact on decision @@@ -@@ @ making throug@@ hits analy@@ ses , instruments and standards .

we are pleased to present this sum@@ m@@ ary of the 2007 European school survey findings produced by the European School Sur@@ v@@ ey Project on Al@@ co@@ hol and O@@ ther Dru@@ gs ( ES@@ PA@@ D ) .
we have made this sum@@ m@@ ary available in 23 languages to ensure the wide@@ st possible dis@@ sem@@ ination in Europe .
it serves as a comple@@ ment to the full report that is available in English .
this multi@@ lin@@ gual sum@@ m@@ ary is a product of the co@@ operation framework that exists between the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and ES@@ PA@@ D .
the mandate of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is to collect , analy@@ se and dis@@ semin@@ ate fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information on the European drug situation .
the information provided by the ES@@ PA@@ D project is an important source of information for obtaining the European picture on younger people .
the ES@@ PA@@ D project provides a common approach to collecting information on sub@@ stance use among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old students in Europe and allows trends over time to be assessed .
the work of the ES@@ PA@@ D project would not have been possible without the gener@@ ous support of the Swedish Government , the Swedish National Institute of Public Health and the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou Group .
sum@@ m@@ ary performed in 7 out of 16 federal states ( Bun@@ des@@ l@@ ä@@ n@@ der ) while the Belgian data collection was restricted to the Dutch speaking part ( F@@ lan@@ ders ) .
so far four data collection waves have been conducted within the ES@@ PA@@ D project .
the first study was held in 26 countries in 1995 , while the 2007 data collection was performed in 35 countries .
this sum@@ m@@ ary presents key results from the 2007 survey as well as findings regarding the long@@ term trends .
an initial section gives a short over@@ view of the meth@@ od@@ ology .
country samp@@ le siz@@ es were close to or above the recommended number of 2 400 apart from the smaller countries , where fewer , but all relevant , students were surveyed .
independent research teams in the participating countries form the basis of the collabor@@ ative project .
a small number of questions regarding cigarette smoking are given at the beginning of the questionnaire .
on average , in the 2007 survey , 58 % of the students in participating countries reported having tried smoking cigarettes at least once and 29 % had used cigarettes during the past 30 days .
two percent of all students had sm@@ oked at least a p@@ ac@@ ket of cigarettes per day during the past 30 days .
data were collected by group @@@ -@@ @ administered questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res .
the students answ@@ ered the questi@@ onn@@ ai@@ res anony@@ mo@@ us@@ ly in the class@@ room with teachers or research ass@@ ist@@ ants functioning as survey leaders .
there is no obvious geographical pat@@ tern at hand , but students in central and eastern European countries are often among those reporting higher rates of smoking .
in all ES@@ PA@@ D countries at least two thirds of the students have dr@@ un@@ k alcohol at least once during their lif@@ etime , with an ES@@ PA@@ D average close to 90 % in the 2007 survey .
in countries where more students smoke , one is also more likely to find students reporting that cigarettes are easily ob@@ tain@@ able .
an early smoking debut ( age 13 or younger ) is also associated , at the country level , with high levels of use in the past month .
on average , 7 % of the students said that they had been smoking cigarettes on a daily basis at the age of 13 or younger .
for example , alcohol use during the past 30 days was reported by 80 % of the students in Austria and Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) but only by 31 % in Iceland and 35 % in Armenia .
however , in individual countries great differences may be ob@@ serv@@ able .
for example , boys were 16 percentage points above girls in Armenia and conver@@ sely , girls were 19 percentage points above boys in Mon@@ aco .
the figures for lif@@ etime , past 12 months and past 30 days pre@@ val@@ ences are about the same for boys and girls .
however , when it comes to higher frequ@@ encies in the respective time frame ( 40 , 20 and 10 times ) the propor@@ tions are usually higher among boys .
if the comparison is con@@ fined to the period between 1999 and 2007 , the drop in relatively recent smoking is seven percentage points .
a small overall gender gap ( 4 percentage points ) was noticed in 1995 but this gap had van@@ ished in 2007 .
only four countries give a contrary image regarding the long@@ term down@@ ward trend in recent smoking , dis@@ playing higher levels in 2007 than in 1995 .
hence , the overall picture of the trend in past 30 days smoking in the ES@@ PA@@ D countries is one of a decrease , or at least of a stabil@@ ized situation .
the total amount of alcohol consu@@ med during the last drinking day is usually low in countries where the students drink often , for example in Greece , and the other way around for countries with low consumption frequ@@ encies .
in nearly all countries boys drink larger quantities than girls . the most pronounced contrast to this is Iceland , where girls report larger quantities than boys .
in a large majority of the countries , beer is the dominant be@@ verage among boys while spir@@ its is the most important be@@ verage among girls in a little more than half of the countries .
some countries score high on both measures , for example Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man and the United Kingdom .
however , there are countries in which many students report heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days , while they were rather low on the ranking list for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness for the same period .
beer is even more dominant among boys , accounting for about half their total consumption on the last drinking day . girls have a more even@@ ly distributed pat@@ tern , with spir@@ its as the most important type , con@@ stitut@@ ing about one third of the total consumption .
on average 43 % of the ES@@ PA@@ D students reported heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days , and this was more common among boys ( 47 % ) than among girls ( 39 % ) .
boys also dominated in a large majority of the countries .
in some few the figures were about the same , but there are also countries in which more girls than boys stated this .
on the country level there is a strong positive relationship between reported alcohol consumption for the last drinking day and the perceived level of in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ation on that day .
in the latter period this is especially true among girls , with an increase from 35 to 42 % .
on average , half of the ES@@ PA@@ D students have been in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ated at least once during their lif@@ etime , to the point of stag@@ gering when walk@@ ing , having s@@ l@@ urred speech or thro@@ wing up .
there were gender differences in the frequ@@ encies of dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness within countries , with higher figures for boys in some countries and for girls in others , while on the average ES@@ PA@@ D level there were no gender differences .
the most pronounced increase between 2003 and 2007 is found in Portugal , where the pro@@ portion of students reporting heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking during the past 30 days increased from 25 to 56 % , i@@ .@@ e@@ . by 31 percentage points .
other countries with large increases include Poland ( which returned close to the 1999 level after a drop in 2003 ) ( 16 percentage points ) , France ( 15 ) , Croatia ( 14 ) and Bulgaria ( 12 ) .
countries with many students that have been dr@@ un@@ k during the past 12 months usually have high figures for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness during the past 30 days .
countries in which many students report dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness this often include Denmark ( limited compar@@ ability ) , the Is@@ le of Man , the United Kingdom and Austria , with figures from 49 to 31 % for past 30 days dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness .
countries on the other end of the scale include Armenia ( 2 % ) and Cyprus ( 9 % ) .
this measure of " heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking " shows to some extent a different

other drugs inqu@@ ired about , but not included in the illi@@ cit drugs @@@ -@@ @ index , are mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms , G@@ H@@ B and an@@ abol@@ ic ster@@ o@@ ids .
lif@@ etime use of mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms was reported by 3 % while G@@ H@@ B and ster@@ o@@ ids were mentioned by 1 % , which is of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de as reported experience of in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use .
students reported problems related to their alcohol consumption include Bulgaria , the Is@@ le of Man , the United Kingdom and Latvia .
on the country level there is a positive cor@@ relation between problems experienced and in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ation during the past 30 days .
however , for some of the problems the aver@@ ages are about the same and for one ( " serious problems with friends " ) it is even slightly higher among girls .
in the two top @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries ( the Czech Republic and the Is@@ le of Man ) one in six students reported can@@ na@@ bis use in the past 30 days , indicating more regular can@@ na@@ bis consumption in those countries .
only 1 @@@ -@@ @ 2 % in Armenia , the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands , Finland , Norway , Romania and Sweden reported such recent use . high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries are most often found in western Europe .
one @@@ -@@ @ third of the students in the ES@@ PA@@ D countries find can@@ na@@ bis read@@ ily available .
boys consider can@@ na@@ bis slightly more easily ob@@ tain@@ able than girls do , though the gender difference is fairly small .
countries where many students report past 30 days can@@ na@@ bis use are in many cases the same ones where many students report having had the opportunity to try can@@ na@@ bis , but without doing so .
on average , 23 % of the boys and 17 % of the girls have tried illi@@ cit drugs at least once during their lif@@ etime according to the 2007 survey .
overall , one out of seven past @@@ -@@ @ year can@@ na@@ bis users ( 14 % ) was classified as having a high risk of developing can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems , and the average pre@@ val@@ ence of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users across countries was 2 % .
country specific differences in the risk of harm from can@@ na@@ bis were found , and the percentage of high @@@ -@@ @ risk users in a population correspon@@ ds to the can@@ na@@ bis use pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the single countries .
the vast majority of the students who have tried illi@@ cit drugs have used can@@ na@@ bis .
on average , slightly more girls than boys report non@@ pres@@ cri@@ bed use of these drugs ( 8 % ver@@ sus 5 % ) and in the top eight countries , twice as many girls as boys did so .
in about half of the countries there is no gender difference to speak of however .
in Estonia and the Slovak Republic there are continuous increases between all four measure points ( 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) , while the Czech Republic , Lithuania and Malta also display an overall up@@ ward trend when the period is considered all in all .
slightly more girls than boys did so ( 8 ver@@ sus 5 % ) .
this vari@@ able shows some simil@@ ar@@ ities with the other one concerning use of pharmaceutical drugs mentioned above .
fir@@ st@@ ly , the pro@@ portion of students stat@@ ing lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence for these two vari@@ ables is more or less of the same mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de .
since there is a high co @@@ -@@ @ vari@@ ation between illi@@ cit drug use and can@@ na@@ bis use on the country level , quite n@@ atur@@ ally the development for lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is more or less the same as described for all illi@@ cit drugs above .
the overall impression is that the increase in illi@@ cit drug use between 1995 and 2003 noted among the ES@@ PA@@ D countries has at least come to a halt , if not a decrease , especially considering that there are no increases in any country for recent use of can@@ na@@ bis between 2003 and 2007 .
students from Cyprus , the Is@@ le of Man , Malta and Slovenia report the highest lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ hal@@ ants in 2007 ( 16 % ) , while only 3 % mention this in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Ukraine .
the average for lif@@ etime use of in@@ hal@@ ants for all ES@@ PA@@ D countries is 9 % and there are no gender differences on the ag@@ gre@@ gate level .
the rates for use in the past 12 months and in the past 30 days follow that for lif@@ etime use relatively well across countries .
no typical geo@@ graphic pat@@ tern is observed - the highest rates of in@@ hal@@ ant use are reported from different parts of Europe .
the lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence figures remain relatively stable over the period 1995 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 among countries with data for all four waves .
it is well known that , on the individual level , there is often a relationship between the use of different substan@@ ces .
N@@ on@@ pres@@ cri@@ bed use of tran@@ qu@@ il@@ lis@@ ers or sed@@ atives however shows no cor@@ relations on the ag@@ gre@@ gate country level with use of the substan@@ ces just mentioned .
those countries do not cl@@ us@@ ter . on the contrary ; they are located relatively distant from each other and spread throughout Europe .
the overall sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ use trends for all the countries with data from all four waves display a slightly different development depending on the vari@@ able in focus .
the up@@ ward trend between 1995 and 2003 in lif@@ etime use of illi@@ cit drugs - predominantly can@@ na@@ bis - has come to a halt ; the 2007 figure is three percentage points below that for 2003 .
no changes in gender differences are apparent for illi@@ cit drugs or the other substan@@ ces mentioned .
individual country pre@@ val@@ ence rates for the key@@ vari@@ ables are compared to the aver@@ ages for all countries .
the countries with results mostly around or below average are Armenia , Cyprus , Greece , Iceland , Portugal and Romania .
the Far@@ o@@ e Is@@ lands could also be included in the list , even though it lacks information for two of the vari@@ ables .
most measures on sub@@ stance use show a recent ( 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 2007 ) stable or slightly down@@ ward trend on average , except for heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking .
two geo@@ graph@@ ically distant countries , Armenia and the Is@@ le of Man , are the ones most distant regarding sub@@ stance use .

a contrary situation is noted for Lithuania and Russia ( Moscow ) , where alcohol and cigarette use is declining at the same time as illi@@ cit drug use is rising .
to sum up , trend developments over the 12 years of the ES@@ PA@@ D project indicate a fall in smoking in a majority of the countries .
the situation is more or less unchanged as regards alcohol use in the past 12 months and the past 30 days .
on the other hand , heavy ep@@ iso@@ dic drinking shows a small but continuous increase throughout the period .
use of illi@@ cit drugs is still dominated by can@@ na@@ bis use .
countries dis@@ playing rather more up@@ ward than down@@ ward long@@ term trends are the Czech and Slovak Repub@@ lic@@ s .
the fourth ES@@ PA@@ D data collection in 2007 gave a lot of new and important information about changes in students " sub@@ stance use .
we hope that still more European countries will join in the next survey , in addition to the over 40 countries that are part of the ES@@ PA@@ D project already .

chapter 8
this is the 11th annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction , available this year in 23 European languages .
and tangible progress has been made . this has meant that European policymakers have had to make difficult cho@@ ices , and they have largely done so after carefully studying the available evidence .
such a policy perspective should be appla@@ u@@ ded .
the global debate on the drug problem is not short on rhetoric regarding the need for a balanced and evidence @@@ -@@ @ based approach .
in Europe , perhaps more than anywhere else , this rhetoric has become reality .
the information available to support our analysis has grown considerably .
this year 's report is based on data from the 25 EU M@@ ember States and Norway and , where available , from Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey .
not only has the number of countries providing information increased , but the amount of compar@@ able information available from each has continued to grow .
this information provides us with a far more detailed picture of the European drug situation and its dynam@@ ics than ever before .
it is the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's task to explore this complex@@ ity , drawing together common experiences where they exist as well as commenting on differences .
drug use is a complex issue , and it is not one that len@@ ds itself to simple conclusions .
a ref@@ le@@ ction on the information available also remin@@ ds us of the need for continued vig@@ il@@ ance and of the dangers of compla@@ cen@@ cy .
warning notes are so@@ unded in this report in respect of dru@@ g@@ related HIV inf@@ ections and dru@@ g@@ related deaths .
non@@ e@@ theless , in Europe as a whole , a tre@@ mend@@ ous effort has been made to address these sor@@ ts of problems ,
Ac@@ know@@ led@@ gements
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA would like to than@@ k the following for their help in producing this report :
• the heads of the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points and their staff ;
• the services within each M@@ ember State that collected the raw data for this report ;
• the Mem@@ bers of the Management Board and the Scientific Committee of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ;
• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal Wor@@ king Party on Dru@@ gs - and the European Commission ;

commen@@ tary - the drug problem in Europe
here no consensus currently prev@@ ails and different approaches have been adopted across Europe , ranging from the issuing of general operational guidelines through to specif@@ ic@@ ation of legal limits .
this can be seen in a number of recent developments that support Co@@ ordination and co@@ operation activities .
among these developments are the coming into force in 2005 of two new EC regulations on prec@@ ur@@ sors and a Council decision on new drugs .
in addition , measures against drug trafficking are strengthened by new legal instruments to address money laundering and confis@@ cation of assets .
however , the development that is most central to shap@@ ing European collaboration and future actions on the drug issue is the new EU drug strategy for 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 12 and its two accompan@@ ying action plans .
in the first of these , around 100 planned specific actions are detailed by EU M@@ ember States to be implemented by 2008 .
a continuous programme of evaluation is envis@@ aged for the strategy , with annual progress re@@ views and impact assessments at the end of each of the two action plan periods .
nearly 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid treatment demands are made by individuals aged 35 years or more , with only 7 % of clients seeking treatment for the first time being aged under 20 .
across Europe as a whole , the substantial growth in drug sub@@ stitution treatment that has occurred in recent years means that the treatment system
the strategy can be seen as representing a European consensus on how the drug problem should be addressed .
non@@ e@@ theless , the new drug strategy suggests that the European policy debate on drugs is increasingly characterised by agreement on a common framework for activities .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe includes an increasing , and ag@@ eing , population of people with heroin problems , who are likely to require care and remain major consumers of resources for many years to come .
available suggests a general decrease in drug in@@ j@@ ection over the longer term .
however , in many of the new M@@ ember States in@@ j@@ ecting rates remain high .
an important c@@ av@@ eat here is that the avail@@ ability of national or sub@@ national estimates of drug in@@ j@@ ecting is poor .
moreover , studies of in@@ j@@ ecting in some regions have even reported slight increases recently .
notably , among the old M@@ ember States , Denmark , Greece , Spain , France , Italy and the United Kingdom all report declining rates of in@@ j@@ ecting among heroin users in treatment .
heroin consu@@ med in Europe is manufac@@ tured predominantly in Afghanistan .
no clear trends are visible with respect to average p@@ urity ; however , the five @@@ -@@ @ year price trend ( 1999 @@@ -@@ @ 2004 ) correc@@ ted for inflation is down@@ wards in most countries .
nevertheless , although heroin is more read@@ ily available and cheaper in Europe , there is no evidence yet that this is influ@@ encing overall levels of consumption .
among those new to treatment , the numbers with a primary op@@ i@@ oid problem have been decreas@@ ing in most countries .
non@@ e@@ theless , this is an area where waves of ep@@ i@@ demic use have been seen in the past , and therefore compla@@ cen@@ cy must be avoided .
for example , ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge provision , once regarded as a controversial intervention , is available to some degree in virtually all M@@ ember States , although the coverage var@@ ies considerably between countries .
most countries report low rates of newly diagnos@@ ed HIV infection attri@@ but@@ able to drug in@@ j@@ ecting , and HIV infection rates among in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are estimated to be below 5 % .
in this year 's report , there are wor@@ rying indicators that the number of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , which has generally declined since 2000 , increased slightly in a majority of countries in 2004 .
in@@ j@@ ecting and in@@ j@@ ecting @@@ -@@ @ related health problems : a constant compan@@ ion
mir@@ r@@ oring to some extent the picture for heroin , overall the information
tre@@ ating the H@@ C@@ V @@@ -@@ @ related health problems among drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors and ex @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors is likely to remain a major health cost for many years to come .
cocaine : signs of stability for Europe 's second most common illi@@ cit drug
( note that these estimates rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population and are the most recent estimates available .
for complete data and full meth@@ od@@ ological notes see the accompan@@ ying statistical bul@@ letin . )
lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence : at least 65 million , or one in fi ve European adults
last year use : 2@@ 2.5 million European adults or one third of lif@@ etime users
overall range 0.@@ 8 % to 1@@ 1.3 %
estimates of cocaine use ( last year pre@@ val@@ ence ) now place the drug slightly ahead of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and ec@@ st@@ asy as Europe 's second most used illi@@ cit drug .
however , the general picture is one of stabilisation in levels of use after a period in which users of the drug increased considerably in number .
the large increases in cocaine pre@@ val@@ ence experienced by Spain and the United Kingdom from the mid to late 1990s seem to have stabil@@ ised since 2000 or 2001 .
elsewhere , while some moderate increases in levels of cocaine use have been noted in a few countries , dramatic increases are not being reported .
overall , the cocaine situation remains very het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous in Europe and significant cocaine use is restricted to a few , mainly western European , countries .
last year use : 3 million or one third of lif@@ etime users
typical range 0.@@ 3 % to 1.5 % ( 15 countries )
it would be wrong to conclude that the signs of stabilisation in use of cocaine will necessarily result in a stabilisation in the extent of problems attributed to use of this drug .
in Europe , cocaine use is at histor@@ ically high levels , and studies suggest that it is a common pat@@ tern for increases in problems relating to a drug to la@@ g some years behind increases in pre@@ val@@ ence .
this is because it takes time for intensive and regular pat@@ ter@@ ns of drug use to develop and for problems to become visible .
this may be beginning to happen in those European countries where cocaine use is now well established .
although the use of cr@@ ack cocaine remains very limited in Europe , reports of problems from some cities suggest that the situation may be deterior@@ ating .
almost 7 000 ac@@ ute drug deaths , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2003 data )
more than half a million op@@ i@@ oid users received sub@@ stitution treatment in 2003
although data are limited , in the 2005 national reports over 400 deaths were identified as being ca@@ us@@ ally related to cocaine use , and cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related deaths appeared to be increasing in all high@@ pre@@ val@@ ence countries .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
drug use in Europe cheaper than ever before data suggest that in Europe as a whole the cost of buying drugs has fallen .
for most countries , the pre@@ dominant five @@@ -@@ @ year trend has been a decline in street price for can@@ na@@ bis , heroin , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , ec@@ st@@ asy and cocaine ( see graphic below ) .
data on street prices are difficult both to collect and to interpre@@ t .
drug prices also v@@ ary considerably between countries and are subject to f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ations over time that reflect dis@@ rup@@ tions in supply .
prices have been ad@@ jus@@ ted for national inflation rates ( base year 1999 ) and all series inde@@ xed to a base of 100 in 1999 .
many countries can@@ not supply these data , which are difficult to obtain and often un@@ reliable and in@@ complete .

the need better to define and understand pol@@ y@@ drug use
a common theme running through this report is the increasing need to develop responses that are sensitive to the complex and multi@@ fac@@ eted nature of today 's drug problem .
when prevention , treatment or harm reduction activities are considered , there is a need to better understand what constitu@@ tes good practice and evidence @@@ -@@ @ based action .
among the total of approximately 380 000 treatment demands reported in 2004 , can@@ na@@ bis was the primary reason for refer@@ r@@ al to treatment in about 15 % of all cases , making it the next most com@@ mon@@ ly reported drug after heroin .
treatment services are also dealing with more sti@@ mul@@ ant and pol@@ y@@ drug problems , including a considerable over@@ la@@ p of illi@@ cit drug and alcohol problems .
back to the future : anticip@@ ating threats and challenges
in this year 's report , as always , an attempt is made to identify emerging trends to anticipate future problems .
such analysis is by defin@@ ition spec@@ ula@@ tive and must be made with caution . a drug clearly associated with severe public health problems is meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine .
while g@@ lob@@ ally meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine problems continue to grow , within Europe the drug remains restricted to a few countries with long @@@ -@@ @ established problems .
in 2006 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA published a technical paper on hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms , and this issue is again sum@@ mar@@ ised in our annual reporting .
the avail@@ ability and use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms appears to have been increasing since the late 1990s but to a large extent has passed un@@ noticed .
for the most part , use of this type of drug appears to be experim@@ ental and reports of problems remain rare .
P@@ sil@@ oc@@ y@@ bin and p@@ sil@@ oc@@ in , two of the psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces found in hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms , are controlled by an international convention .
however , the fact that mus@@ h@@ rooms grow n@@ atur@@ ally in many countries poses a more complex issue for legislation , and they are treated differ@@ ently across Europe .
the emer@@ gence of m@@ C@@ P@@ P illu@@ stra@@ tes the fact that those involved in the production of illi@@ cit drugs are constantly looking for innovation in the form of new chem@@ ic@@ als that can be introduced to the market - in this case probably to poten@@ ti@@ ate or modi@@ fy the effects of M@@ D@@ MA ( ec@@ st@@ asy ) .
such innovation requires a response as the potential for these substan@@ ces to cause severe health problems is unknown .

annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
Hungary and Portugal are the first two countries in Europe to have requested external assessment of their national drug strategies .
there have also been developments in both the types and acces@@ sibility of treatment available for drug ad@@ dicts .
and in Romania , the national drug strategy 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 was evalu@@ ated with the participation of all state institutions involved in the field of drugs with the findings forming the basis for the new national drug strategy 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 12 .
in Luxembourg , 87 % of the measures set out in the 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 national drug action plan have been implemented within the specified deadlines .
it is reported that the measures not introduced ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . a heroin distribution programme ) have been delayed mainly for political reasons .
actions not yet implemented have been included in the new action plan .
Dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture
furthermore , reports over the last year suggest that national drug strategies are beginning to have visible effects .
two countries reported more recent bud@@ geted expendi@@ ture for tackling drugs : Luxembourg ( EU@@ R 6 million in 2005 ) and the United Kingdom ( EU@@ R 2 billion in 2004 / 05 ) .
on the other hand , it also found that there has been a fall in the age at which people first experim@@ ent with drugs and an increase in dru@@ g@@ related deaths linked to substan@@ ces other than op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
in addition , the Ministry of Health and Con@@ sum@@ ers " Affairs has approved an action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 to mobil@@ ise resources and implement initiatives with the aim of pro@@ g@@ ressing and rev@@ it@@ alising the national drug strategy .

this action plan was presented by the Commission in May 2005 and approved by the Council in June 2005 .
drug supply reduction
first , having examined the Commission 's proposal of February 2005 , and taking fully into account the final evaluation of the EU drug strategy and EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the Council endorsed the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 in June 2005 .
it was replaced in December 2004 by a new regulation with an extended application framework aimed at

it is conce@@ ived as a continuous , incre@@ mental and particip@@ ative process .
it is continuous because the European Commission , with the support of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , will present annual progress re@@ views .
finally , the process will be particip@@ ative , involving an evaluation ste@@ ering group whose task will be to define the meth@@ od@@ ology , output and provisional cal@@ end@@ ar .
as in the evaluation of the EU action plan ( 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 ) , the ste@@ ering group will be made up of representatives of relevant Commission departments , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , as well as representatives of the M@@ ember States .
Con@@ sul@@ t@@ ative hearings for civil society representatives will also be organised .
it has been replaced by a new regulation adopted on 11 February 2004 ( 4 ) .

in addition , a regulation lay@@ ing down rules for implementing these two
these actions in the area of prec@@ ur@@ sors control complete another part of the important activities of the EU in the field of supply reduction .
u@@ tilis@@ ing the new opportunities provided since the Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ cht Treaty , the EU has developed a legal framework to combat drug trafficking and to improve law enforcement co@@ operation .
a framework decision on " the confis@@ cation of crime @@@ -@@ @ related proceeds , instr@@ um@@ ent@@ alities and property " was also adopted by the Council on 24 February 2005 .
it aims to ensure that all M@@ ember States have in place effective rules governing the confis@@ cation of instr@@ um@@ ent@@ alities and the proceeds of criminal offences punis@@ ha@@ ble by de@@ priv@@ ation of liber@@ ty for more than one year .
EU legislation in this area existed previously but was considered insufficient .
this new framework decision aims to achieve effective cross @@@ -@@ @ border co@@ operation with regard to confis@@ cation .
the M@@ ember States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this framework decision by 15 March 2007 .
in addition to these legal instruments , a programme for police and judicial co@@ operation in criminal matters has been adopted and implemented .

there have also been some modi@@ fic@@ ations of legal instruments in the field of money laundering and confis@@ cation .
direc@@ tive 91 / 3@@ 08 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( 6 ) , adopted in 1991 on the legal basis related to the internal market and modi@@ fied in 2001 , attempted to harmonise legislation in this area among M@@ ember States .

two new penalties can also be imposed for these offences : monitored home imprisonment or community service .
possession of more than 10 dos@@ es must be charged under Sec@@ tion 17@@ 2 , which , depending on the ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating circumstances , provides for prison sentences ranging from four years to life .
in addition , the age of criminal li@@ ability has also been lowered from 15 to 14 years .
the maximum sentence for theft of a large amount of drugs or theft by an organised group has been extended to 15 years .
finally , on 31 August 2005 , the Commission adopted a new proposal for the rec@@ asting of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA founding regulation .
the new regulation is an important instrument to facilitate the work of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA because of the new tasks it defin@@ es .
it also contains several changes to the Scientific Committee and the Management Board .
based on Article 15@@ 2 T@@ EC , this text must now be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament according to the co @@@ -@@ @ decision procedure .
a few countries made major changes to their drug laws in the reporting period concerning both possession and trafficking offences and penalties .
exem@@ ption from penalty and postpon@@ ing the exec@@ ution of the penalty can now be applied to drug law offences .
treatment of ad@@ dicts can now take place through an integrated assistance programme , over@@ seen by a case manager .
in Bulgaria , the new narco@@ tic substan@@ ces and prec@@ ur@@ sors Control Ac@@ t was approved in June 2004 .
several countries legisla@@ ted on threshold quantities of drugs during the reporting period .
difficulties in defining the quanti@@ ty of a single d@@ ose and evidence that the exception has been mis@@ used in court to benefit drug deal@@ ers were among the reasons given for this measure .
in Belgium , following the Constitutional Court 's annul@@ ment of Article 16 of the 2003 law , a new joint direc@@ tive of the Minister of Justice and the Prosecut@@ ors @@@ -@@ @ General dealt with can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ r@@ ing@@ ements .
monitoring of sentences given to drug offen@@ ders has been discussed or implemented in several countries , and in some cases action has already been taken on the results .
in March 2005 , the Land Berlin passed a revision of its " guide@@ line on can@@ na@@ bis , " according to which possession of up to 10 gram@@ s of can@@ na@@ bis is not prosecuted if certain criteria are fulfilled .
this amount can be increased to 15 gram@@ s in individual cases .
the Minister of Health of Lithuania amended recommendations on what shall be regarded as small , large and very large amounts of narco@@ tic and psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces , re@@ defining these quantities .
the af@@ ore@@ mentioned study on these differences , carried out for the Ministry of Health , looked at the sent@@ encing of over 1 800 cases in six different L@@ ä@@ n@@ der ( Sch@@ ä@@ fer and Pa@@ ol@@ i , 2006 ) .

other sent@@ encing statistics showed that the w@@ ai@@ ving of reports as stat@@ ut@@ ory alternatives to punishment increased in 2004 , though police reports and convic@@ tions increased further , while the number of suspended proceedings dropped slightly .
a survey carried out in 2004 among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds in Finland showed that about 7 % of those who had used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year had financed their use illegally , more than half by selling drugs and the rest mainly by ste@@ aling ( Ki@@ vi@@ v@@ u@@ ori et al . , 2005 , cited in the Finnish national report ) .
in Romania , court sent@@ encing statistics were examined in order to monitor the success of social re@@ integration of drug users who commit offences other than drug use . in the majority of cases , the penalty was suspension of the san@@ ction under surveillance .
from 2004 , it was noted that the courts less often imposed comp@@ ul@@ sory treatment , effectively decreas@@ ing the involvement of the prob@@ ation services and thus their contribution to the social rehabilitation of drug users .

data on " reports " ( 11 ) of drug law offences are available in all the European countries analy@@ sed in this report .

in most EU M@@ ember States the majority of reported drug law offences ( 17 ) are related to drug use or possession for use ( 18 ) , ranging in 2004 from 61 % of all drug law offences in Poland to 90 % in Austria .
over the same five @@@ -@@ @ year period , the number of offences for use / possession for use increased overall in all reporting countries , except Italy , Portugal , Slovenia , Bulgaria and Turkey , which reported a declining trend ( 19 ) .

European drug policies : extended beyond illi@@ cit drugs ? , in E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 2006 annual report : selected issues
a slow integration , strate@@ g@@ ically or institu@@ tionally , of li@@ cit drugs into policy and measures against illi@@ cit drugs appears to be more and more common .
in Europe , the scope of drug policies is beginning to stretch beyond illi@@ cit drugs and to en@@ comp@@ ass other ad@@ dic@@ tive substan@@ ces or even types of behaviour .
this is found in the drug policies of some M@@ ember States and in EU drug strategies .
increasingly , research is addressing the issue of addi@@ ction or ad@@ dic@@ tive behavi@@ ours ir@@ respective of the substan@@ ces concerned .
chapter 2@@ Res@@ pon@@ ding to drug problems in Europe - an over@@ view
universal school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention
the role of mass media campaigns is increasingly being seen as one of raising awareness ( to under@@ pin , support and explain to the population at large the ration@@ ale under@@ lying environmental strategies ) rather than one of changing behaviour .
public health prevention
programme @@@ -@@ @ based prevention approaches are gaining ground within school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention .
programme @@@ -@@ @ based prevention imp@@ lies stand@@ ardis@@ ed delivery in a defined number of sessions , each with exactly defined contents , and detailed teacher and pup@@ il material .
this facilit@@ ates monitoring and evaluation and increases the accur@@ acy , fi@@ del@@ ity and consist@@ ency of interven@@ tions , leading to high @@@ -@@ @ quality delivery .
as a result , more M@@ ember States than before are monitoring school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention interven@@ tions ( the Czech Republic , Greece , Spain , Ireland , Italy , Cyprus , Hungary , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) .
the first ever European drug abuse prevention trial ( www.@@ eu@@ d@@ ap@@ .net ) has shown promising results .
a compar@@ able programme @@@ -@@ @ based research approach is blueprint in the United Kingdom ( 30 ) .
additionally , more attention is now given to stricter technical gu@@ idance and to better coverage in the implementation of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . in France and Ireland ) .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe four countries ( Belgium , Germany , Italy and Luxembourg ) reporting on new projects in this area .
in Italy , the priority of many projects is now to protect children , mothers and immig@@ rant families or those belonging to ethnic minorities .
Luxembourg reports that special attention is given to young people and to the biggest immig@@ rant community , focusing on lin@@ gu@@ istic and soci@@ o@@ cultural specif@@ ic@@ ities .
the main sub@@ groups at which selec@@ tive prevention in schools is aimed are students with social behavi@@ our@@ al problems , school problems or family problems , immig@@ rant students and those belonging to ethnic minorities .
in fact , academic performance and school attendance are good predic@@ tors for drug problems , and monitoring these enables early and accur@@ ate intervention .
recommends that health promotion and prevention policy should be implemented by school authorities and that the police force should not be involved in prevention programmes .
following this line of action , Portugal continues to run a pro@@ xim@@ ity policing programme , Es@@ col@@ a S@@ eg@@ ura ( safe school ) .
in France , experts trained by the law enforcement services to li@@ a@@ ise with youth or grown @@@ -@@ @ up populations visit schools or other services on request .
selec@@ tive prevention
with the recognition and development of the selec@@ tive prevention approach by most M@@ ember States , vulnerable groups are increasingly being targeted .
similar projects are reported in Ireland , Portugal ( 47 projects ) , Romania ( one project ) and Norway ( bro@@ ch@@ ures for teachers ) .
students most at risk are targeted by selec@@ tive prevention programmes in Malta , while in France and Slovakia coun@@ selling services are provided in schools on the basis of ( sel@@ f@@ - ) refer@@ r@@ al .
family @@@ -@@ @ based prevention
with growing numbers of younger children initi@@ ating drug use , the improvement and intensi@@ fication of family @@@ -@@ @ based prevention are of increasing importance .
in pre @@@ -@@ @ teenagers , family influence prev@@ ails over pe@@ er influence .
the role of the family in establishing norms and support for children is more relevant to prevention than im@@ par@@ ting information on substan@@ ces .
several countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Poland and Slovakia ) have begun to put emphasis on vulnerable groups .
in Sweden , the most obvious increase in activities compared with previous years has been in programmes for pre @@@ -@@ @ school children at risk and school children with ex@@ ter@@ n@@ alising behavi@@ ours .
the number of municipalities implementing these programmes has approximately doubled .
in addition , Norway is developing a national strategy for early intervention against problem drug and alcohol use in which prevention efforts will specifically target risk groups .
approaches not based on abst@@ in@@ ence are effective in reducing not only consumption but also initi@@ ation among those groups in which in@@ cip@@ i@@ ent drug use is already oc@@ curr@@ ing .
thus , Poland has a nationwide programme to change the dru@@ g@@ related behaviour of vulnerable children or children who are in the early stages of drug use .
the specific objective of the Polish programme is to support the family in solving drug problems .
in this regard , it is hel@@ p@@ ful that the concept of selec@@ tive prevention does not focus on drug use and does not sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ se drug use ; rather , its focus is on vulner@@ ability in a broader sense .
family @@@ -@@ @ based prevention in the EU is becoming more targeted and more firmly needs @@@ -@@ @ based .
several M@@ ember States ( Germany , Spain , Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom ) have acknowledged that it can be difficult for institutions to contact problem families .
chapter 2 : responding to drug problems in Europe - an over@@ view at risk are now being implemented .
Greece and Austria are leading the way in defining specif@@ ic@@ ations for the accredi@@ tation of prevention agencies or prevention professionals .
the " strengthening families programme " ( S@@ F@@ P ) is being implemented in Spain ( P@@ alma de Mal@@ lor@@ ca and Barcelona ) , the Netherlands ( two cities , evaluation study ) and Sweden ( two cities ) .
training in Ireland and Italy is under way and it is envis@@ aged in the latter that coverage will extend to several cities .
Norway is evalu@@ ating the similar M@@ S@@ T programme in a r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trial .
these selec@@ tive family @@@ -@@ @ based programmes have similar features in all M@@ ember States where they have been implemented .
the context for E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA data collection on harm reduction and treatment responses to the drug problem is provided by two main EU instruments :
programmes for neglec@@ ted children and young people from dys@@ functional families are being run in Poland and in some provinces in Austria .
these programmes are implemented in local community @@@ -@@ @ based venues such as soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic common rooms , up@@ bringing facilities , youth clubs and prevention centres .
some countries are focusing increasingly on the children of alco@@ hol@@ ics ( Belgium , Germany , Austria ) .
the remaining countries still focus solely on the children of drug users .
community @@@ -@@ @ located prevention
this recommendation has been rein@@ forced by its inclusion in the EU action plan as objective 14 .
most selec@@ tive prevention programmes are operated at the level of the community .
partly , this is because the various social services involved are usually co@@ ordinated at this level .
however , in countries where communities have the power and will to enforce local norms , the community is a natural unit for environmental strategies .
in order to evaluate the level of implementation of the strategy , it is important to determine levels of service provision and the extent to which the services are being used .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe of the ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological situation that has been achieved by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ driven development and implementation of indicator @@@ -@@ @ based monitoring , stand@@ ardis@@ ed reporting on responses is limited .
it is now available and used in the majority of M@@ ember States .
as bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is controlled under a less str@@ ingent schedule of UN drug conven@@ tions , countries are given greater possibilities for its pres@@ cri@@ ption .
in some countries , this treatment option has led to rapid increases in the number of clients treated .
the new M@@ ember States and candidate countries account for only a small frac@@ tion of the clients in sub@@ stitution treatment in the European region , which can partly be explained by lower levels of op@@ i@@ oid use in these countries .
although the overall provision of sub@@ stitution treatment remains low in these countries , there are some indic@@ ations of increases in Estonia , Lithuania and Bulgaria .
by 2001 , 24 EU countries as well as Bulgaria , Romania and Norway had introduced it ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) . however , scale and coverage differ considerably between countries ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .

provision and type of drug dependence treatment
common response pro@@ files are visible in Europe with regard to the prevention of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases among drug users and the reduction of dru@@ g@@ related deaths ( see also C@@ hap@@ ter 7 ) .
a survey conducted among national fo@@ cal points ( N@@ F@@ P@@ s ) in 2005 assessed the general character@@ isti@@ cs of treatment provision in Europe .
national experts were asked whether the majority of op@@ i@@ oid users were treated in drug @@@ -@@ @ free or medi@@ cally assisted programmes or whether both mod@@ alities were equally pre@@ valent .
the reduction of dru@@ g@@ related deaths was defined for the first time as a European drug policy objective six years ago , and it is an objective of the current EU action plan ( 33 ) .
in the Czech Republic , Italy , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , local or regional policies are reported to exist , and in Bulgaria strategies have been drawn up at local level in nine cities .
the results show a rati@@ o largely in favour of medi@@ cally assisted treatment , with the main sub@@ stance used being meth@@ ad@@ one ( except in the Czech Republic and France ; for more details see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
the results further show that dru@@ g@@ related treatment in most countries is predominantly provided in out@@ patient sett@@ ings - only Latvia and Turkey provide most treatment in in@@ patient sett@@ ings .
traditional psy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic treatment mod@@ alities ( psych@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ic , cogn@@ itive @@@ -@@ @ behavi@@ our@@ al , system@@ ic / family ther@@ ap@@ y or G@@ es@@ tal@@ t ther@@ ap@@ y ) are the most frequently used mod@@ alities in out@@ patient treatment in Ireland , Latvia , the United Kingdom , Bulgaria and Turkey .
this emphasises the continued importance that European governments and the Commission place on the health@@ related
actions and interven@@ tions concerning drug users in prisons in the new M@@ ember States

Dru@@ g@@ related prer@@ ele@@ ase interven@@ tions mainly take the form of coun@@ selling and information provision ( Czech Republic , Latvia , Lithuania , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia ) .
sub@@ stitution treatment as a prer@@ ele@@ ase intervention is available in all prisons in Slovenia and in less than 50 % of prisons in Poland .
drug testing in prisons is reported in the majority of new M@@ ember States .
however , countries v@@ ary in terms of their drug testing sch@@ e@@ mes .
in@@ mates are tested upon admission only in the Czech Republic , Malta and Slovenia .
Malta and Slovenia are also the only countries to test prisoners before they go on leave .
ran@@ dom drug testing is carried out in all prisons in the Czech Republic , Malta , Slovenia and Slovakia and in less than 50 % of prisons in Hungary .
few prisons in the new M@@ ember States report harm reduction measures for in@@ j@@ ecting drug users .
ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange programmes are not implemented in prisons in any of the new M@@ ember States , and only Estonia , Lithuania and Slovenia report the provision of dis@@ inf@@ ec@@ tants for clean@@ ing sy@@ r@@ inges .

according to the reports by N@@ F@@ P@@ s ( 35 ) , objectives and target groups in national strategies also show a high level of sy@@ ner@@ gy at the European level . besides drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , target groups include sex workers and prisoners .
in the new central European M@@ ember States in particular , but also in Norway , young people and non @@@ -@@ @ in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors are clearly addressed as further important target groups for action to prevent inf@@ ec@@ tious disease .
Danish and Estonian policies wi@@ den the target groups even more and include groups in close contact with drug users .
in many EU countries , strategies aimed at reducing inf@@ ec@@ tious disease are clearly ge@@ ar@@ ed towards HIV / AIDS , particularly Estonia , Spain , Cyprus , Latvia and Lithuania .

targeted treatment and quality management public discussion in Austria was boosted by an international conference on the topic held in Vienna in 2005 .
the current EU action plan also calls for high @@@ -@@ @ quality treatment and harm reduction services .
the common strategic platform on the reduction of health@@ related harm that the EU drug strategy provides is mir@@ ro@@ red in many national policies across the EU and has supported a main@@ stream@@ ing of evidence @@@ -@@ @ based responses in this area .
in 2004 , an improvement in the monitoring of sy@@ rin@@ ge avail@@ ability at European level was documented .
however , information on the provision , u@@ tilis@@ ation and coverage of the wide range of further important services delivered by low@@ threshold agencies is bar@@ ely recorded at national level in most countries .
a European picture can@@ not easily be drawn .
a project to improve the data situation is described in the box " Lo@@ w @@@ -@@ @ threshold agencies as an important data source . "
L@@ ow@@ threshold agencies as an important data source
treatment units or programmes that exclusively service one specified target group are a common phenomenon across the EU .
for populations of drug users that are " hidden " or more difficult to reach or have lost contact with the care system , these agencies can provide a point of contact and a setting for deliver@@ ing medical and social services .
units that speci@@ alise in tre@@ ating can@@ na@@ bis or cocaine users have been reported from 13 countries , and specific treatment programmes for these groups in drugs agencies exist in eight countries .
however , the avail@@ ability and acces@@ sibility of such services are rated to be low in most of these countries .
a similar specialised programme for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users is reported from Spain , Slovakia and the United Kingdom .
an initiative in this direction is the joint E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ relation project , supported by experts from the national fo@@ cal points of France , Ireland , Hungary and Norway .
annual report 2006 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 action plan calls on M@@ ember States to " improve access to and coverage of rehabilitation and social re@@ integration programmes . "
although social measures are still a less well @@@ -@@ @ established response to problem drug use than treatment , interven@@ tions combin@@ ing treatment , health and social actions are recognised by professionals as the best response to achieve drug us@@ er rehabilitation .
non@@ e@@ theless , no clear consensus currently exists across Europe on the cost and benefits of this approach and it remains an area where there is considerable political and scientific debate .
in 2004 / 05 , in response to the EU action plan , 20 of the
the main provider of funds is to be found at state / national level in 11 countries , whereas funding is predominantly at regional / local level in eight countries .
under the current economic circumstances , many countries may find it difficult to meet the voc@@ ational re@@ integration needs of older heroin users , even if they are stabil@@ ised in drug maintenance treatment .
the service most com@@ mon@@ ly offered to home@@ less problem drug users is access to " gener@@ ic housing services " ( in 21 countries ) , while 18 countries offer housing facilities solely for problem drug users and 13 countries comb@@ ine the two systems .
all the available literature and facts and figures from M@@ ember States conver@@ ge towards the same truth : the life situations of drug users are far more problematic and prec@@ ar@@ ious than those of the general population .
thus , in the last two EU drug action plans , social re@@ integration has been one of the ultimate aims in order to improve the health and social status of drug users .
) Social re@@ integration is defined as " any social intervention with the aim of integr@@ ating former or current problem drug users into the community . " the three
" pil@@ lars " of social re@@ integration are housing , education and employment ( including voc@@ ational training ) .
other measures , such as coun@@ selling and le@@ is@@ ure activities , may also be used .
as facilities are currently available in most countries , and as some countries continue to implement new structures , the effect of these measures will depend on ensuring that home@@ less problem drug users can access these services .
how have M@@ ember States developed gender @@@ -@@ @ specific approaches to drug prevention , treatment , social rehabilitation and harm reduction ?
are gender @@@ -@@ @ specific responses equally important for mal@@ es and fem@@ al@@ es ?
generally among drug users , mal@@ es far out@@ number fem@@ al@@ es .
in the EU M@@ ember States , not only is the use of illi@@ cit drugs more common in mal@@ es , but men are much more likely to develop problems , seek treatment and die from drug use .
this selected issue looks at drug use and related problems from a gender perspective .
among the important questions
production and trafficking
other countries also mentioned in 2004 as source countries for the can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seized in the EU include Albania , Portugal , Sen@@ eg@@ al , Afghanistan , Pakistan and countries in central Asia ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports , 2005 ; W@@ C@@ O , 2005 ; IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 6@@ a ) .
Lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e production of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in is concentrated in a few countries , in particular Mor@@ oc@@ co , but also Pakistan and Afghanistan .
total global production of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in is estimated to be 7 400 tonnes annually ( CN@@ D , 2006 ) .
most can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in consu@@ med in the EU origin@@ ates in Mor@@ oc@@ co ; it is smuggled mainly via the I@@ ber@@ ian peninsula , although the Netherlands seems to represent a secondary distribution centre for further transport to EU countries .
in 2004 , the total area under cultiv@@ ation amounted to 120 500 hectares
global potential her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis production was estimated at over 40 000 tonnes in 2003 ( CN@@ D , 2005 ) , with source countries throughout the world .
in addition , local ( in@@ door or out@@ door ) cultiv@@ ation and production of can@@ na@@ bis products takes place in most of the EU M@@ ember States .
interpre@@ ting seiz@@ ures and other market data
worldwide , a total of 1 4@@ 71 tonnes of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in and 6 18@@ 9 tonnes of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis was seized in 2004 .
quantities seized may f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seiz@@ ures are very large .
for this reason , the number of seiz@@ ures is sometimes a better indicator of trends .
in all countries , the number of seiz@@ ures includes a major pro@@ portion of small seiz@@ ures at the retail ( street ) level .
where known , origin and destination of drugs seized may indicate trafficking routes and producing areas .
the price and p@@ urity / poten@@ cy of drugs at retail level are reported by most of the M@@ ember States .
however , data come from a range of different sources , which are not always compar@@ able , making accur@@ ate compar@@ is@@ ons between countries difficul@@ t@@ . cul@@ t .

) This should be checked against missing 2004 data when available .
data on both number of can@@ na@@ bis seiz@@ ures and quantities of can@@ na@@ bis seized in 2004 were not available for Ireland and the United Kingdom ; data on number of can@@ na@@ bis seiz@@ ures were not available for the Netherlands in 2004 .
for esti@@ m@@ ating purposes , 2004 missing data were replaced by 2003 data .
data on quantities seized in 2004 provided by the Netherlands were only estimates , which could not be included in the analysis of trends to 2004 .

esti@@ m@@ ating drug use in the population
last year use is clearly lower than lif@@ etime experience .
it is estimated that about 2@@ 2.5 million European adults have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year , about 7 % of those aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 .
estimates of last month pre@@ val@@ ence will more closely represent regular use of the drug .
it is estimated that 12 million European adults have used the drug in the last 30 days , about 4 % of adults .
country figures range between 0.5 % and 7.5 % , a 15 @@@ -@@ @ fold difference .
the lowest figures were reported from Lithuania , Malta , Sweden and Bulgaria , and the highest from the Czech Republic ( 4.@@ 8 % ) , Spain ( 7.@@ 6 % ) and the United Kingdom ( 5.6 % ) ( 57 ) .
" last year use " and " last month use " reflect the current situation more accur@@ ately , with the latter weigh@@ ted more heavily towards people who use the drug frequently .
use of illegal drugs , including can@@ na@@ bis , is concentrated mainly among young people .
ES@@ PA@@ D surveys were conducted in 1995 , 1999 and 2003 .
the next survey will take place in 2007 .
participation in ES@@ PA@@ D has grown with each survey , with 26 European countries participating in 1995 , 30 in 1999 and 35 in 2003 , including 22 EU M@@ ember States and four candidate countries ( Bulgaria , Croatia , Romania and Turkey ) .
the survey questions focus on alcohol consumption and use of illi@@ cit drugs , with the standard time fra@@ mes , and frequ@@ ency of use .

chapter 3 : can@@ na@@ bis continuation and from 10 % to 25 % for last 30 days
this could represent an important long @@@ -@@ @ term change in can@@ na@@ bis use pat@@ ter@@ ns that mer@@ its further attention .
at European level . a crude estimate drawn in the 2004 annual report ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ a ) suggests that 1 % of European adults , about 3 million people , could be daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis users .
other countries are also working on scal@@ es to assess intensive forms of can@@ na@@ bis use ( Germany , Netherlands , Poland and Portugal ) , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is promoting collaboration in this area .
use of can@@ na@@ bis , like that of other illegal drugs , is notably higher among mal@@ es than among fem@@ al@@ es .
can@@ na@@ bis use is also more common in urban areas or areas with a high population den@@ s@@ ity .
it has been hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ ised that use may be spreading to smaller towns or rural areas , and Poland documented this trend in its 2005 national report .
65 forms of can@@ na@@ bis use (
tr@@ acking long @@@ -@@ @ term trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence of reliable time @@@ -@@ @ series data .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the early 1990s on@@ wards , and some of these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sights into trends over time .
it is generally considered that can@@ na@@ bis use started to spread in some European countries in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s and became popular in the 197@@ 0s and 1980s .
Swedish data document a relatively high level of experim@@ entation in the 197@@ 0s among cons@@ cripts ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 % ) .
the fact that intensive can@@ na@@ bis use often co @@@ -@@ @ occur@@ s with non @@@ -@@ @ drug @@@ -@@ @ specif@@ i c mental problems has practical implications .
all other treatment mod@@ alities have either not been studied at all or in@@ sufficiently studied ; thus evidence for e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness is lacking .
) Se@@ e F@@ ig@@ ure G@@ PS @@@ -@@ @ 24 in the 2006 statistical bul@@ letin . ) There is as yet no uni@@ vers@@ ally accepted defin@@ ition of " intensive can@@ na@@ bis use " ; rather the defin@@ ition var@@ ies across different studies .
it is , however , a broad term meaning use of can@@ na@@ bis that exceeds a certain threshold of frequ@@ ency .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
in this chapter , figures refer to " daily or almost daily use " ( defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days ) .
this bench@@ mark has often been used in studies and can be der@@ ived from the European model questionnaire .
risk of dependency among less frequent users is lower .
estimates of last month pre@@ val@@ ence also generally increased in the past decade , although pronounced increases occurred only in Belgium and Spain .
the United Kingdom has recently reported a decrease in last month use , having previously presented the highest levels in Europe since the early 1990s .
in addition , Slovakia reported a decrease between 2002 and 2004 .
in the Czech Republic and France it was not possible to assess the trend .

in addition , school surveys can give valuable information about trends in drug use among the younger members of the population , which may predict future trends among young adults .
in most countries , since 1995 , there has been an overall increase in the number of school students who have ever tried can@@ na@@ bis .
however , geographical vari@@ ations in trends are marked .
trends in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use among school students aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 16 years can be categor@@ ised into three geographical groups .
in Ireland and the United Kingdom , which have long histor@@ ies of can@@ na@@ bis use , lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence is high but has remained stable during the last decade ( around 37 @@@ -@@ @ 39 % ) .
in the eastern and central European M@@ ember States , together with Denmark , Spain , France , Italy and Portugal , lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use in 2003 was substan@@ tially higher than it was in 1995 .

over the period 1999 @@@ -@@ @ 2004 , the pro@@ portion of all new clients seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis increased in most countries that reported data ( 73
some recent studies also report that there has been an increase in ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents seeking treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use who have co@@ existing mental health problems , and that this may be an important factor influ@@ encing demand for treatment ( 78
74 in a few countries the propor@@ tions are roughly equal (
75 out@@ patient sett@@ ings (
it is also important to understand better the needs of can@@ na@@ bis users at the population level .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA estimates there are around 3 million intensive can@@ na@@ bis users ( defined as daily or almost daily can@@ na@@ bis use ) in the EU .
although the number of these requiring interven@@ tions is unknown , the number of can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related treatment demands is small in relation to this figure .
a number of factors are likely to be associated with the increased demand for can@@ na@@ bis treatment , and this remains an area requiring research scrutiny .
the available data suggest that can@@ na@@ bis clients in out@@ patient treatment centres tend to be relatively young : virtually all can@@ na@@ bis clients new to treatment are under 30 years old .
most clients report having first used can@@ na@@ bis when in the youngest age groups , with 3@@ 6.@@ 8 % using the drug for the first time before the age of 15 .
almost no one seeking treatment reports having used can@@ na@@ bis for the first time after the age of
overall , can@@ na@@ bis clients can be divided into three groups : those who use it occasi@@ onally ( 34 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 32 % ) and those using it daily ( 34 % ) .
this vari@@ ation probably reflects differences in refer@@ r@@ al to treatment ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . more refer@@ r@@ als from the criminal justice system or from social networks ) ( 77 ) .
the extent to which can@@ na@@ bis users in treatment meet diagnos@@ tic criteria for either dependence or harmful drug use is an important question .
as refer@@ r@@ al practices differ between countries , there is a need for studies to document the differing clin@@ ical character@@ isti@@ cs of those receiving treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use .
well @@@ -@@ @ implemented universal prevention programmes can delay or reduce the initi@@ ation of young people into the use of substan@@ ces such as tobacco , alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis .
the importance of this is underlined by evidence that early @@@ -@@ @ on@@ set users ( pre@@ - to mid @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ o@@ le@@ sc@@ ence ) have a significantly higher risk of developing drug problems , including dependence ( V@@ on Sy@@ dow et al . , 2002 ; Ch@@ en et al . , 2005 ) .
an additional consideration in stri@@ ving to prevent or delay the on@@ set of initi@@ ation into can@@ na@@ bis use is the fact that ad@@ o@@ les@@ cents are more vulnerable to can@@ na@@ bis to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity .
some clients seek treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use in combination with other drug or alcohol problems , and sometimes the request for treatment is related to more general problems , such as conduct dis@@ order among young people . furthermore ,
the pro@@ files of young can@@ na@@ bis users , at least in the early stages of consumption , do not differ from those of young alcohol or tobacco users .
this supports the idea that universal

motiv@@ ation to participate largely comes from the fact that attendance at such courses is an oblig@@ atory part of a judicial sentence .
non@@ e@@ theless , these methods enable contact to be established with at least part of the group at risk .
gender is an important issue in can@@ na@@ bis prevention ( see the selected issue on gender ) .
however , this is changing as the traditional roles of mal@@ es and fem@@ al@@ es change in modern societies .
in several European countries projects aimed at preventing can@@ na@@ bis as well as alcohol use ( Bag@@ ma@@ en@@ den@@ e , Denmark ; Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ Group , Germany ; and Ris@@ f@@ lec@@ ting , Austria ) attempt to address boys " lack of communication skills .
it is known that one reason for intensive consumption of alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis among boys is that they find it difficult to approach girls , and thus these projects offer training in f@@ li@@ r@@ ting .
the German project st@@ oned at School aims to train teachers in early detection and early intervention , prevention of can@@ na@@ bis consumption , and establishing contact between schools and drug coun@@ selling facilities .
like similar projects in Austria , it is a 10 @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ dul@@ e training scheme to increase teachers " awareness of can@@ na@@ bis consumption and identify pupils at risk .
many European selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ tions tend towards the provision of information on can@@ na@@ bis .
the same authors found that comprehensive social influence programmes have an important effect on vulnerable young people .
specific drug coun@@ selling centres are frequent in Germany , France and the Netherlands .
since January 2005 , more than 250 " can@@ na@@ bis consultation " clinics have been set up throughout the French territories .
they are located in the major French cities for easy access .
this new type of structure is to be subj@@ ected a follow @@@ -@@ @ up study .
brief intervention for can@@ na@@ bis users
brief interven@@ tions are cost @@@ -@@ @ effective and may be particularly appropriate to can@@ na@@ bis users , as they are found to work well with drug users who :
• are experiencing few problems with their drug use ;
• have low levels of dependence ;
• have a short history of drug use ;
brief intervention is an approach that aims to make people reflect on their use of drugs and to provide them with skills to control it .
• are un@@ sure or ambi@@ valent about changing their drug use .
brief intervention is often targeted at an early stage of a person 's alcohol or drug use to prevent the development of serious drug problems later on .
there is evidence for the effectiveness of brief intervention in preventing alcohol and tobacco misuse , and there is growing interest in the value of this approach for other substan@@ ces .
this kind of approach is now used in several countries , including Germany , the Netherlands , Austria and the United Kingdom , where interven@@ tions may take the form of coun@@ selling , " can@@ na@@ bis courses " or even self @@@ -@@ @ help websites .
for example , the German website @@@ -@@ @ based coun@@ selling programme , Qu@@ it the S@@ hit ( www.@@ dru@@ g@@ com@@ .@@ de ) , is an innovative approach , using te@@ lem@@ atics , for can@@ na@@ bis users who want to reduce or stop their drug use .
similar websites with self @@@ -@@ @ help components include www.@@ jel@@ lin@@ ek@@ .@@ n@@ l / z@@ el@@ f@@ h@@ ul@@ p / can@@ na@@ bis / fra@@ mes@@ et@@ .h@@ t@@ m@@ l by Jel@@ lin@@ ek ( the Netherlands ) and www.@@ know@@ can@@ n@@ ab@@ is@@ .@@ org@@ .@@ uk / by hit ( United Kingdom ) .

the production of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and ec@@ st@@ asy is difficult to quanti@@ fy because " it starts with read@@ ily available chem@@ ic@@ als , in easily conce@@ aled laborat@@ ories " ( UNODC , 200@@ 3@@ a ) .
the most recent estimate of annual global production of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and ec@@ st@@ asy is about 5@@ 20 tonnes ( UNODC , 200@@ 3@@ b ) .
global seiz@@ ures of these substan@@ ces pe@@ aked in 2000 at 46 tonnes .
following a decline in 2001 and 2002 , seiz@@ ures increased again to 34 tonnes in 2003 , and declined slightly to 29 tonnes in 2004 .
amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine are central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ants .
of the two drugs , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine is by far the more com@@ mon@@ ly available in Europe .
worldwide , increasing levels of use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine are a cause for considerable concern , as the drug is associated with a range of severe health problems .
within Europe , significant meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use appears to be restricted to the Czech Republic .
ec@@ st@@ asy ref@@ ers to syn@@ thetic substan@@ ces that are chem@@ ically related to amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines but which differ to some extent in their effects .
the best @@@ -@@ @ known member of the ec@@ st@@ asy group of drugs is 3,4 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ y@@ len@@ edi@@ ox@@ y @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ( M@@ D@@ MA ) , but other anal@@ o@@ gues are also occasi@@ onally found in ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets ( M@@ DA , M@@ D@@ EA , et@@ c . ) .
these drugs are sometimes known as ent@@ ac@@ to@@ gen@@ s , a reference to their very specific mood @@@ -@@ @ alter@@ ing effects .
sometimes they prov@@ oke effects more typically associated with hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces .
worldwide , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine production remains concentrated in western and central Europe , in particular in Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland .
outside Europe , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine is mainly manufac@@ tured in North America and O@@ ce@@ ania ( CN@@ D , 2006 ) .
trafficking in amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine in 2004 remained mainly in@@ tr@@ are@@ gi@@ onal .
most amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine found on European illi@@ cit markets comes from Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland , and also from Estonia and Lithuania ( in the Nordic countries ) ( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports , 2005 ; W@@ C@@ O , 2005 ) .
histor@@ ically , ly@@ ser@@ gic ac@@ id di@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ide ( L@@ SD ) has been by far the best @@@ -@@ @ known hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug , but overall consumption levels have been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time .
recently , evidence of increased avail@@ ability and use of n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces , hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms in particular , has emerged .
in 2004 , an estimated 33 000 seiz@@ ures of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , amounting to 5.2 tonnes and 9.@@ 6 million units , were made in the EU .

six countries have tigh@@ tened up their legislation on mus@@ h@@ rooms in the last five years ( Denmark , Germany , Estonia , Ireland , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom ) .

for example , in the United Kingdom , during the early 200@@ 0s , the number of shops selling hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms increased , and by 2005 it was estimated that they were being sold in about 300 shops and market stal@@ ls across the country .
the sale of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms through the Internet also emerged , with sites , mainly based in the Netherlands , selling fresh mus@@ h@@ rooms , growing k@@ its and spor@@ e prin@@ ts .
online marketing of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms is conducted in a variety of languages , mainly English , French and German , im@@ plying a wide international consumer base .
recent ad@@ ult and school population surveys in the EU indicate that , among young people aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 24 years , lif@@ etime use of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms ran@@ ges from less than 1 % to 8 % ( 1@@ 28 ) .
however , there are indic@@ ations that continuation rates are lower for hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms than for most other drugs .
this is a common feature of hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug use and reflects the fact that young people generally choose to conf@@ ine this type of drug use the misuse of these drugs for rec@@ re@@ ational purposes ( 130 ) .
in March 2001 the UN drug control system added G@@ H@@ B to the list of internationally controlled drugs , and as a result all EU M@@ ember States have been up@@ dating their legislation on this sub@@ stance .

in contrast to heroin addi@@ ction , which can be treated with ag@@ on@@ ists such as meth@@ ad@@ one or ant@@ ag@@ on@@ ists such as n@@ alt@@ re@@ x@@ one , there are currently no medical treat@@ ments available for cocaine addi@@ ction .
the reason for this would appear to be the mechanism of action through which cocaine ex@@ er@@ ts its effects on the brain ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ am@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in .
harm reduction approaches
one exc@@ iting Str@@ and of research is the use of im@@ mun@@ other@@ ap@@ y , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the development of a vacc@@ ine that would effectively " neut@@ ral@@ ise " the action of cocaine by preventing the drug from reaching the brain .
the basic concept has undergone limited testing .
a vacc@@ ine developed in the United Kingdom was tested in a small number of cocaine ad@@ dicts , 18 in total , over a period of 14 weeks .
it was found that three quarters of the vacc@@ inated co@@ h@@ ort of cocaine ad@@ dicts were able to remain drug free for a period of three months with no un@@ toward side@@ effects .
in addition , after six months , both those who rela@@ p@@ sed and those who did not stated that the feel@@ ings of e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia were not as po@@ tent as prior to vacc@@ ination .
as a result of these findings , the vacc@@ ine , known as drug @@@ -@@ @ prote@@ in con@@ j@@ ug@@ ate T@@ a @@@ -@@ @ CD , is undergoing phase 2 clin@@ ical trials .
an alternative im@@ mun@@ other@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic approach involves the development of mon@@ o@@ cl@@ onal anti@@ bodies to cocaine , but this has only been tested prec@@ lin@@ ically .
the potential benefit of the cocaine vacc@@ ine T@@ a @@@ -@@ @ CD has raised ethical concerns about the use of a vacc@@ ine : who would receive it , who would make the decision and on what criteria , et@@ c .
in Europe , the development of harm reduction approaches that target cocaine use has been limited .
the value of prevention and harm reduction approaches to reducing the risks associated with cocaine use remains largely un@@ explo@@ red , but a number of areas may have potential for the development of this kind of approach .
as cocaine use can escal@@ ate quickly , brief interven@@ tions that can alert users to the fact that they may be beginning to experience negative consequences due to their use of the drug may also be worth expl@@ oring .
in a number of cities cr@@ ack cocaine users have been targeted by out@@ reach sch@@ e@@ mes that attempt to engage with what is often viewed as a difficult group to work with .
although overall the evidence base remains relatively weak , some studies have suggested that benefits can acc@@ ru@@ e .
for example , one study of an innovative out@@ reach treatment programme in Rot@@ ter@@ dam ( Hen@@ s@@ ken@@ s , 2004 , cited in the Dutch national report ) identified factors that were observed to be important for tre@@ ating this group of clients , who are often difficult to engage in conventional drug services .
a more controversial approach has been adopted in some cities in Europe , where the concept of safe consumption rooms , usually targeting drug in@@ j@@ ection , has been extended to drug in@@ hal@@ ation .
rooms for supervised in@@ hal@@ ation have been opened in several Dutch , German and Swiss cities ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 4@@ c ) .

in the United Kingdom , the inci@@ dence of HIV among I@@ D@@ U@@ s has slowly increased but is now stable at just under 2.5 cases per million population per year .
reducing drug in@@ j@@ ecting and the sharing of in@@ j@@ ecting equipment has therefore become a primary goal of public health interven@@ tions in this area .
Studies also point to a relationship between drug use and high @@@ -@@ @ risk sexual activity ; this suggests a growing importance in linking drug use interven@@ tions with public health strategies aimed at sexual health .

preventing inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases
it must be noted that evidence on effectiveness is strongest for the prevention of HIV infection among drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
a robust body of available evidence shows that interven@@ tions can be considered effective and that access to treatment of all types provides protection ( Far@@ rell et al . , 2005 ; WHO , 2005 ) .
since the mid@@ 1990s , the European response has been characterised by an increasing provision of drug dependence treatment ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and overall this appears to be one of the elements that have contributed to the relatively encouraging picture now seen in Europe in terms of ep@@ i@@ demic spread of HIV among in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .

combin@@ ing distribution and sales data suggests that , in a year , drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors obtain on average 125 sy@@ r@@ inges in the Czech Republic and 140 sy@@ r@@ inges in Finland .
the meas@@ urement of sy@@ rin@@ ge coverage is an important component of understanding the likely effects of sy@@ rin@@ ge distribution in disease prevention and for assessing un@@ met needs .
however , it is important to take account of the avail@@ ability of sy@@ r@@ inges through pharmac@@ ies sales ( prices , den@@ s@@ ity of p@@ har@@ macy network ) as well as drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors " behavi@@ our@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns and environmental factors in interpre@@ ting these data .

chapter 8@@ Im@@ proving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
European drug situation . increasingly , we are seeing a more complex picture with respect to chron@@ ic drug problems in Europe .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA indicator of problem drug use ( P@@ D@@ U ) monitors " in@@ j@@ ecting drug use or long @@@ -@@ @ dur@@ ation / regular use of heroin , cocaine and / or amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines . "
included in the defin@@ ition , by convention , is the use of other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids such as meth@@ ad@@ one .
the enlargement of the EU has embrac@@ ed a greater variety of social behavi@@ ours , with illi@@ cit drug use no exception .
this defin@@ ition of P@@ D@@ U is a pu@@ rely behavi@@ our@@ al one based on drug consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns and does not exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly measure problems in any sense .
non@@ e@@ theless , it is linked to the various concep@@ ts of addi@@ ction by the understanding that someone be@@ having in this way is very likely to fall within the more general concept of a " problem us@@ er . "
• it is relatively easy to oper@@ ation@@ alise in research studies ;
• it groups together different types of drugs and mo@@ des of administration as alternatives , without specifically differ@@ enti@@ ating between them .
this changing position must be seen against the background of greatly expanded treatment provision for those with op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ related problems as well as increased reporting coverage of treatment services .
non@@ e@@ theless , in many countries it appears that those developing a drug problem today in Europe are likely to be , in terms of the substan@@ ces they are using at least , more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous than has histor@@ ically been the case .
the P@@ D@@ U indicator and counting hidden populations of drug users
histor@@ ically speaking , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA monitoring indicator was a child of its time - during the 1980s , and to a large extent the 1990s , heroin use and in@@ j@@ ecting drug use were seen as key components of the drug problem that required esti@@ mation .
furthermore , these forms of drug use could not be meas@@ ured convinc@@ ingly by survey techniques .
while the P@@ D@@ U indicator still gives us a useful window on an important element of the drug problem , it is increasingly apparent that it needs further development to meet the requirements of monitoring today 's more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous
in terms of the current implementation of the P@@ D@@ U indicator across the EU , countries have adap@@ ted the defin@@ ition to cover the prac@@ tic@@ alities of their local situation and the position is therefore het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous .

earlier in this report a separate estimate of heroin use and in@@ j@@ ecting in Europe was provided for the first time .
in addition , we note the increase in treatment avail@@ ability for op@@ i@@ oid problems , with estimates of over half a million op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treat@@ ments in Europe .
this suggests that the pro@@ portion of heroin users and in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors having or having had contact with treatment services may be quite large in many countries .
moving beyond the P@@ D@@ U indicator
a further step in developing our ability to understand better the European drug problem is to explore the extent to which intensive drug use can be incorpor@@ ated into the monitoring exercise , beyond P@@ D@@ U monitoring .
these kinds of indirect statistical methods comple@@ ment population survey work , which , for a range of meth@@ od@@ ological and practical reasons , is less su@@ itable for esti@@ m@@ ating the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use that is of low pre@@ val@@ ence , sti@@ gm@@ ati@@ sed and largely hidden .
addressing this problem requires developing a better understanding of the pat@@ ter@@ ns of pol@@ y@@ drug use and applying this to improve national and European @@@ -@@ @ level reporting .
the way forward in this area requires the form@@ alising of the concept of frequent , intensive use of can@@ na@@ bis and other illi@@ cit drugs as a specific target for monitoring .
frequent or intensive use can be meas@@ ured in survey data to comple@@ ment its esti@@ mation through indirect statistical methods .
currently , survey data provide a useful window on different pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis use , but these are largely restricted behavi@@ our@@ al and frequ@@ ency of use measures .
for instance , this is the case with problem users who use different op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , as well as pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , cocaine , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and alcohol .
a number of European countries are working on developing meth@@ od@@ ological tools for measuring both intensive use and levels of dependence and problems , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is promoting collaboration in this area of work .
this pat@@ tern of use seems to exist among some chron@@ ic users , possibly among margin@@ alised groups , possibly among people with psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric conditions .
in many recor@@ ding systems in Europe , these cases will be attributed to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
under these circumstances , any monitoring of the component parts of problem drug use would need to include pol@@ y@@ drug use as one of these separately meas@@ ured components .
although problem op@@ i@@ oid use is strongly characterised by daily pat@@ ter@@ ns of use , this is often not the case for sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs .
the challenge of reporting pol@@ y@@ drug use problems
for good practical and meth@@ od@@ ological reasons most reporting on drug use describes each sub@@ stance separately .
a second drug with a functional or pharmac@@ ological ration@@ ale is not con@@ fined to simultane@@ ous use but may also be used consecu@@ tively , as a replacement or as a comple@@ mentary drug .
chapter 8 : improving the monitoring of problem consumption and multiple drug consumption
increased risks through pol@@ y@@ drug use
the risk level will depend on the dos@@ age level of both substan@@ ces .
survey results do show considerable use of more than two drugs by individuals in the same time period .
an example of the extent of pol@@ y@@ drug use data available from population surveys can be seen in a recent technical report of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ( 200@@ 5@@ b ) .
limits of the data available on pol@@ y@@ drug use
developing an operational defin@@ ition of pol@@ y@@ drug use : a question of timing ?
the absence of available data limits reporting on many aspects of pol@@ y@@ drug use .
data are available from to@@ x@@ ic@@ ological reports from drug over@@ dos@@ es and self @@@ -@@ @ reports from those attending treatment services .
while these sources allow some in@@ sights into pol@@ y@@ drug use , the information available is often limited and the represent@@ ati@@ veness of the data needs to be considered .
consideration needs to be given to what time periods are selected for assessing and reporting on pol@@ y@@ drug use .
figure 15 : use of drugs in the last year by different us@@ er groups in the general population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34
0 General population
can@@ na@@ bis users
cocaine users
no single reporting instrument can adequately en@@ comp@@ ass this complex@@ ity .
Pol@@ y@@ drug use could be us@@ efully defined oper@@ ation@@ ally as the frequent use of more than one sub@@ stance over a minimum specified time period , for example one month .
as such , it is an important component in understanding the European drug problem as a whole .
given that many of the data sources available are based on behavi@@ our@@ al reports of drug consumption , the concept of frequent or intensive use needs to be developed on this basis .
this will wi@@ den the perspective for monitoring drug problems beyond that currently found in the P@@ D@@ U indicator .
in parallel , work needs to advance on developing reporting standards that enable pat@@ ter@@ ns of pol@@ y@@ drug use to be better described at the European level .

drug @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases and drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths
this is the 12th annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction .

it also demonstrates Europe 's achievement in implementing a meth@@ od@@ olog@@ ically sound , sustainable and comprehensive information system to monitor drug use .
enforcement .
it is not hard to find areas that ar@@ o@@ use special concern .
non@@ e@@ theless , we feel strongly that it is also important to acknowledge progress where it has been made .
in Europe , more and more M@@ ember States are adopting strategic and planned approaches to tackling the drugs problem .
there has also been a dramatic increase in investment in prevention , treatment and harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction activities and improved co@@ operation and increased focus in supply reduction .
drug use in general remains at histor@@ ically high levels , but it has stabil@@ ised in most areas , and in some areas there are even signs that mer@@ it cautious optimism .
the European Union and its M@@ ember States give considerable support to international programmes and , in a global context , it is satis@@ fying to observe that , in a number of important areas , the European situation looks relatively positive .
the report addresses two fundamental questions .
what is known about drug use in Europe and the problems it causes ?
and what has been learned about responding effectively to drug @@@ -@@ @ related problems ?
they recognise that the way forward lies in analy@@ sing the available evidence regarding both the size and nature of the problem and the costs and benefits of different intervention approaches .
as a result , Europe can be proud that its response to this difficult and often emo@@ tive issue is both r@@ ational and human@@ e .
as a monitoring agency , we deal in facts and figures ; we are committed to being scienti@@ fic@@ ally rigor@@ ous and im@@ partial , interpre@@ ting the information available without prejudi@@ ce or prior position .
this is our role , and as Chairman of the Management Board and Director we accept no compromise on this position and take pride in the high standards we maintain .
but while scientific ri@@ g@@ our is essential to our work , we must never forget that behind the figures we report are real human be@@ ings whose lives have been affected and sometimes ru@@ ined by drug problems .
behind the d@@ ry statistics on treatment demand , drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths and criminal behaviour are the gri@@ ev@@ ing families , lost potential and children growing up in un@@ safe communities .
to develop effective responses to the drugs problem requires us to be dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate about our data , but we must never become dis@@ pas@@ sion@@ ate about the topic .
in this report we also reflect on the progress that has been made in responding to the drugs problem in Europe .
this is particularly per@@ tin@@ ent this year , as both in Europe and internationally we will soon be reflecting on achievements in this area .
in Europe , the drugs situation still represents a serious challenge for health and social policy and for law

Europe plays an increasingly important role in supporting global actions to reduce drug problems
neither trends in the use of drugs nor those who are involved in drug production and trafficking respect national or geo@@ graphic boundaries .
moreover , the EU is now the major international donor supporting the work of the United N@@ ations Office on Dru@@ gs and Crime ( UNODC ) .
parts of the world is relatively comprehensive and robust information available .
the U@@ SA , Canada and Australia can provide mean@@ ing@@ ful comparison points on estimates for last year drug pre@@ val@@ ence .
estimated can@@ na@@ bis use is , on average , considerably lower in the European Union than in the U@@ SA , Canada or Australia .
the pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use is higher in the U@@ SA and Canada than in the European Union and Australia .
Qu@@ anti@@ fying complex@@ ity : setting mean@@ ing@@ ful targets and developing useful sum@@ m@@ ary measures
while acknowledging that the use of drugs remains a major challenge for public health and social policy within Europe , it is also important to recognise these positive developments .
a positive conclusion of this report is that European drug policies are becoming more sensitive to the need to focus on specific activities and develop mean@@ ing@@ ful targets .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe in this area show promise .
moreover , it should be bor@@ ne in mind that these figures do not reflect the social costs of drug use .
pro@@ portion of the prison population in virtually all countries .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently collabor@@ ating with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to establish a database for the collection of prison health indicators .
the general principle that those in prison should have access to the same healthcare options as are available in the wider community is not achieved in many areas for those with drug problems .
not only do many of those entering prison have drug problems , but studies show that drug use often continues in prison .
harm is also one of the key concep@@ ts included in the UNODC 's recently proposed illi@@ cit drug index ( I@@ DI ) .
these sor@@ ts of approaches may prove useful in the future for policy analysis purposes , but they are dependent on the quality of data on which the compos@@ ite measure is based and on the extent to which these data can en@@ comp@@ ass the target concept .
the new regulation of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA emphasises the importance of identi@@ fying and dis@@ semin@@ ating good practice .
a key difficulty here is the real world sett@@ ings in which demand reduction interven@@ tions are applied .
credible controlled studies , the gold standard for most medical interven@@ tions , are often difficult to design or simply im@@ prac@@ tic@@ able .
the complex@@ ities of assessing evidence for effectiveness and identi@@ fying quality control standards are addressed in this report .
can@@ na@@ bis : popularity may have pe@@ aked - as recognition of public health issues gro@@ ws
there are still considerable differences between European countries in the nature and scale of their national drug problems and also in the range and config@@ ur@@ ation of response .
despite this , there is considerable agreement on more general fundament@@ als : that drug policies should be balanced , comprehensive and evidence based .
in the area of demand reduction , the need for prevention , treatment and social rehabilitation activities is accepted by all .
but , histor@@ ically , the topic of harm reduction has been more controversial .
this is changing , and harm reduction as part of a comprehensive package of demand reduction measures now appears to have become a more exp@@ li@@ cit part of the European approach .
it is also evident in a recent report from the European Commission , which found that the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 had played a role in encouraging M@@ ember States to develop and expand harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction activities .
but , even more so than among the population in general , it is by far the most com@@ mon@@ ly consu@@ med illi@@ cit drug by young and very young people .
drug use among those who are developing both physi@@ cally and socially can be a particular problem , and this issue is dealt with in detail in the accompan@@ ying selected issue on drug use in minors .
an important conclusion drawn from the review of the progress made in implementing the Council recommendation of 18 June 2003 was that , despite advances made in other areas , services of all types were usually poorly developed in prison sett@@ ings .
although some M@@ ember States have introduced sch@@ e@@ mes to di@@ ver@@ t offen@@ ders with drug problems into treatment as an alternative to criminal sanctions , those with drug problems continue to account for a significant
at a g@@ lance - estimates of drug use in Europe possession .
( note that these estimates rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population and are the most recent estimates available .
despite considerable public and media debate on the topic , it is hard to see any direct or simple relationship between law enforcement policies and overall pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use .
this has produced a more h@@ omo@@ gen@@ e@@ ous European picture now than has histor@@ ically been the case .
in addition , the most recent data suggest that , particularly in the high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries , can@@ na@@ bis use is moving into a more stable phase or even decreas@@ ing .
and , although the data are still relatively weak , there is some evidence that the popularity of the drug among the younger age groups is decreas@@ ing in some countries .
although national trends v@@ ary overall , it is possible to be cau@@ ti@@ ously optimistic that the escalation of can@@ na@@ bis use that has been seen in Europe since the 1990s may now have reached its peak .
over 7 500 ac@@ ute drug deaths , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them ( 2004 data )
Europe remains the main global market for can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , most of which is produced in North Africa . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis is also available in Europe ,
Co@@ ordinated actions against cocaine trafficking are growing in Europe , and a new inter@@ governmental task force is to be located in Portugal , which appears appropriate given the country 's growing importance in cocaine inter@@ diction .
each year , around 400 cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related deaths are reported in Europe , and there is a suspicion that cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular deaths in which cocaine has been an ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating factor may go largely un@@ detec@@ ted .
requests for drug treatment for those with cocaine problems are rising .
in 2005 , cocaine was the primary drug of about 13 % of clients demanding treatment , and in an even higher pro@@ portion of those new to treatment ( 22 % ) .
the number of new treatment demands reported has roughly tri@@ pled over the last five years , and now stands at over 33 000 .
however , overall cocaine treatment requests are lower than those related to can@@ na@@ bis and considerably lower than for op@@ i@@ oid problems .
HIV : overall assessment positive , but new inf@@ ections under@@ line the need for continued efforts
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has revised its estimate of cocaine use in this report to 4.5 million Europeans having used the drug in the last year , up from 3.5 million in the 2006 annual report .
during the 1990s , the experience , or potential threat , of a widespread HIV ep@@ i@@ demic among drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors was a cataly@@ st for the development of services for this group .
this figure may be low by historical standards , but it still represents a considerable public health problem .
increased pre@@ val@@ ence rates are also reported in the new data available from both Spain and the United Kingdom , the two countries with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence in Europe - although in neither case are the increases dramatic .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , in both countries , cocaine use among the young is relatively high ( 4 @@@ -@@ @ 6 % in 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds ) .
it is important to note that estimates of those experiencing serious problems with cocaine are far lower .
other indicators also demonstrate an up@@ ward trend , confirming the growing importance of cocaine in Europe 's drug problem .
both quantities and numbers of seiz@@ ures have increased , perhaps reflecting increased targeting of
as a result , especially in areas where pre@@ val@@ ence has been high , the burden of infection resulting from in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is likely to be decreas@@ ing .
the situation in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania remains a
commen@@ tary - the drug situation in Europe concern , but here again most of the recent data point to a relative decrease in new inf@@ ections .
( H@@ C@@ V ) - including a significant pro@@ portion who are no longer using drugs .
across Europe , H@@ C@@ V rates are high among in@@ j@@ ecting populations , and studies show that young in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors continue to acquire this disease early in their drug @@@ -@@ @ using care@@ ers , limiting the opportunities for intervention .
this raises the question for Europe : what effect will this increase have on the drug problem ?
Afghanistan - can alternative development measures have an impact ?
the sustainability of the general stable or improving situation seen in heroin use in Europe is called into question by increasing op@@ ium production in Afghanistan .
estimates for 2006 suggest that production increased by 43 % as a result of a substantial increase in the area under cultiv@@ ation .
O@@ pi@@ oid seiz@@ ures and laborat@@ ories disman@@ tled seem to indicate that op@@ ium produced in Afghanistan is increasingly being transformed into mor@@ ph@@ ine or heroin in the country itself , before being exported ( CN@@ D , 2007 ) .
in the north and north @@@ -@@ @ east of the country , not only have increasing wage rates and falling op@@ ium prices deter@@ red pop@@ p@@ y plan@@ ting , but also some high @@@ -@@ @ value vegetables actually generate greater returns than pop@@ p@@ ies .
in these areas , cro@@ p diversi@@ fication has been supported by counter @@@ -@@ @ narcotics efforts and greater governmental involvement - leading to a general perception that op@@ ium prohibi@@ tion measures will be enforced .
these legal income opportunities are , however , not open to all and , in many areas , farmers " options are limited by high transport costs , poor roads and problems ar@@ ising from lack of security .
reductions in cultiv@@ ation can be achieved quickly but are rever@@ sed equally quickly .
down@@ ward trend in drug over@@ d@@ ose deaths ta@@ ils off
over@@ d@@ ose deaths constitute a significant cause of avoi@@ dable mortality among young adults .
of drug treatment data and drug over@@ dos@@ es suggests that the heroin @@@ -@@ @ using population in Europe continues to age , although the picture in eastern European countries is less clear .
however , this trend has not continued in 2004 and 2005 .
particularly of concern is the fact that in a few countries the pro@@ portion of younger people among those dying has been growing .
reducing drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths is an important public health target and the reasons for the f@@ alter@@ ing in the down@@ ward trend needs to be identified .
in Austria , a growing pro@@ portion of treatment demand clients are under 25 and are seeking help for problems due to the use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids di@@ ver@@ ted from legitimate uses .
death by over@@ d@@ ose is not the only health risk facing those with drug problems .
Studies reveal that exc@@ ess mortality from all causes is considerable among problem drug users : as much as 10 times what would be expected in the general population .
Cyprus , Latvia and Romania , have incorpor@@ ated detailed implementation processes in their drug strategies and action plans .
this approach , which has been in place in other M@@ ember States ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Spain , Ireland , the United Kingdom ) for some time , is becoming more widespread and has also been implemented in the current EU action plan on drugs .
in none of these cases was this the first such exercise , and in each of these cases the national reports mentioned that the new drug policy documents had benef@@ ited from the experience of earlier ones .
in 2007 , two M@@ ember States , Malta and Austria , as well as Norway , are due to adopt new drug strategies , while the Czech Republic , Estonia , France and Hungary will implement new action plans .
in this chapter , drug policies in the EU as a whole and in individual M@@ ember States , as well as the relationship between these two levels of policy@@ making , are described .
a data collection exercise brought forward by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA in the reporting period permits an over@@ view of current national drug strategies and institutional fra@@ me@@ works across Europe .
esti@@ m@@ ating the cost of drugs to society is discussed in a section on drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture .
based on data on national public expendi@@ ture reported by M@@ ember States , a first approxim@@ ation is made of the total amount spent by European governments on the drugs phenomenon .
legislative changes focusing on supply reduction and on legal approaches to drug testing are described in a section on recent changes in national laws .
an over@@ view of the latest statistics on drug law offences and trends in offences involving op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and can@@ na@@ bis are presented in a section on drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
the chapter concludes with a section on drug @@@ -@@ @ related research in Europe .
national drug strategies
General situation and new developments
in early 2007 , all EU M@@ ember States , except Italy , Malta and Austria , had a national drug strategy , sometimes accompanied by an action plan .
reducing drug use in general and problem drug use in particular is a key objective of the national drug strategies and action plans of all EU M@@ ember States , candidate countries and Norway .
the objective of preventing and reducing the individual and collective harm resulting from the use of drugs is also shared by all countries .
another common feature is the " comprehensive " approach , where@@ by interven@@ tions aimed at drug supply reduction and those aimed at drug demand reduction are linked .
the " balanced " approach , which aims to give priority both to supply reduction and to demand reduction , is also very widespread .
all these elements are also part of the EU drugs strategy .
a noti@@ ce@@ able trend in recent years has been the shift from a single national planning document to the adoption of two comple@@ mentary instruments : a strategic framework and an action plan .
the policy of combin@@ ing a drug strategy with action plans facilit@@ ates more detailed defin@@ itions of objectives , actions , responsibilities and deadlines . some countries , for example
new regulation of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA enable the agency to provide a more complete picture of the drug phenomenon .
on 12 December 2006 , the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union signed the rec@@ asted regulation of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , which came into force in January 2007 .
emphasis is also given to the need to develop an information system that is sensitive to new and emerging trends .
the new regulation clar@@ i@@ fies the countries to which the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA can transfer its know @@@ -@@ @ how , at the request of the European Commission and with the approval of the Management Board .
the new document broad@@ ens the scope of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's re@@ mit .
particular reference is now made to providing information on the combined use of li@@ cit and illi@@ cit psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces and on best practice in M@@ ember States .
all these new elements will
the role of the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x network of national fo@@ cal points is more clearly defined in the new document .
the rec@@ ast also modi@@ fies the regulation regarding the Scientific Committee .
this will provide the agency with a co@@ hes@@ ive , independent body of emin@@ ent scientists .
in addition to helping to ensure the quality of the work of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , it will also provide a bridge to the wider scientific and research community .
moves towards the integration of li@@ cit and illi@@ cit drugs policies have been evident in some countries for several years ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Germany ,
to know if their policies are implemented and if the expected out@@ comes are achieved .
in two M@@ ember States ( Belgium , Slovenia ) , the scope of the evaluation has been limited to a number of selected projects .
in most other countries , and at EU level , the implementation of the actions set out in the national drug strategy is system@@ atically monitored .
this enables progress re@@ views to be carried out , the findings of which may be used to improve or ren@@ ew existing drug strategies or action plans .
national drug strategies and action plans generally include interven@@ tions in the areas of prevention , treatment and rehabilitation , harm reduction and supply reduction . the extent of the different interven@@ tions and the importance given
2 to each of them var@@ ies , however , between countries (
global evalu@@ ations , covering process , output , outcome and impact , are less frequent in Europe .
evaluation
having in the EU a diversity of national drug strategies with common objectives can be viewed as a strength because it allows compar@@ ative analysis of different types of approach .
the EU and its M@@ ember States have already invested significant resources in this field .
almost all European countries mention the objective of evalu@@ ating their national drug strategy .
governments want
there is also some activity in the area of developing inde@@ x@@ es designed to assess the impact of national drug strategies or the overall drug situation .
see the 2006 selected issue " European drug policies : extended beyond illi@@ cit drugs ? . " see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 .
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
drug policy inde@@ x@@ es countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Finland , Portugal ) , Co@@ ordination at regional or local level is directly supervised by the national Co@@ ordination bodies .
however , a study commissioned by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has shown that it is possible to assess Co@@ ordination systems by focusing on their " implementation quality , " a concept for studying their capacity to produce Co@@ ordination out@@ comes ( Ken@@ is , 2006 ) .
this approach will be further developed to enable it to be used in the evaluation of national drug Co@@ ordination systems .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture
the United Kingdom 's drug harm index ( D@@ H@@ I ) is designed to capture the social costs of har@@ ms generated by the problematic use of any illegal drug .
it covers four types of har@@ ms : health imp@@ acts , community har@@ ms , domestic drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime and commercial drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
the UNODC 's illi@@ cit drug index ( I@@ DI ) combin@@ es three dimen@@ sions of the drug phenomenon : drug production , drug trafficking and drug abuse .
the concep@@ tu@@ alisation of both instruments has involved interesting meth@@ od@@ ological developments and has allowed a first in@@ sight into the use of overall inde@@ x@@ es to evaluate drug strategies and monitor overall drug situations .
a first ob@@ servation is that such instruments can be useful for a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al follow @@@ -@@ @ up of the national situation but that , to understand what is really going on , the result should be con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alised with the analysis of individual indicators within the inde@@ x@@ es .
Co@@ ordination mechanisms
nevertheless , some general features can be described .
at the regional or local level , drug Co@@ ordination agencies and / or drug co@@ ordin@@ ators exist in most countries .
six countries provided detailed information of expendi@@ ture associated with tackling drugs ( T@@ able 1 ) .
in other
this figure is likely to under@@ estimate the full extent of drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture , given the high level of under @@@ -@@ @ reporting . the six countries included in T@@ able 1 account for 76 % of the total public expendi@@ ture reported by EU M@@ ember States
the public expendi@@ ture perspective
Studies on the costs of drug use can be an important source of information for the development and management of drug policies .
the analysis of a State 's public expendi@@ ture provides useful information regarding the ability of its government to spend effectively and effici@@ ent@@ ly@@ . ci@@ ently .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related costs can be divided into two major categories : direct and indirect .
direct costs are those for which payments are made , and typically include expendi@@ ture in the areas of prevention , treatment , harm reduction and law enforcement .
indirect costs are the value of productive services not performed because of drug use , and typically cons@@ ist of lost productivity due to drug @@@ -@@ @ related mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality .
the esti@@ mation of drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture is a different exercise from that of esti@@ m@@ ating social costs .
direct public expenditures exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly la@@ bel@@ led as " drug @@@ -@@ @ related " can be initially tr@@ ac@@ ed back by exha@@ us@@ tively re@@ viewing official financial reporting documents ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . budgets or year @@@ -@@ @ end reports ) .
esti@@ m@@ ations are complicated when drug @@@ -@@ @ related expenditures are not la@@ bel@@ led as such but em@@ bed@@ ded in programmes with broader goals ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . overall police operations budget ) .
in this case , direct non @@@ -@@ @ la@@ bel@@ led drug @@@ -@@ @ related expenses must be calculated through model@@ ling approaches .
drug @@@ -@@ @ related social costs are the total of all the costs to society , direct and indirect , caused by drug use .
the output , expressed in@@ monetary terms , is an estimate of the total burden that drug use places on society ( Sing@@ le et al . , 2001 ) .
determining the social cost of drug use has several benefits .
first , it reve@@ als how much society is spending on drug @@@ -@@ @ related issues and , implic@@ it@@ ly , the amount that would be sav@@ ed if drug use were completely abolished .
second , it identi@@ fies the different components of cost and th@@ es@@ ize of the contribution of each sector in society .
such in@@ form@@ ation@@ can help to determine funding pri@@ or@@ iti@@ es@@ by highligh@@ ting areas where ine@@ ffici@@ encies may exist and savings can be made .
the primary aim of social cost calc@@ ulations is to we@@ igh the burden that drug problems pose on society against the cost to society of addressing these problems ( including possible indirect effects ) .
ultimately , this leads to the question of effectiveness and efficiency : do governments spend their money wis@@ ely on the right problems ?
however , some authors ( Re@@ u@@ ter , 2006 ) have proposed that , for policy purposes , public expenditures are more relevant than social costs .
and Norway . based on the data supplied by these six countries , the total drug @@@ -@@ @ related public expendi@@ ture by European countries is calculated to lie somewhere between
in addition , as of 2005 , the EC and the M@@ ember States had co @@@ -@@ @ financed drug @@@ -@@ @ related assistance projects in third countries to the value of over EU@@ R 750 million .
at EU level , considerable funding will be provided by the European Commission to tackle the drugs issue under the new 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 budget .
other new financial instruments , such as the prevention of and fight against crime programme ,
in response to the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently working towards developing a meth@@ od@@ ology that will enable the M@@ ember States , candidate countries and Norway to comp@@ ile stand@@ ardis@@ ed data on drug @@@ -@@ @ related expendi@@ ture .
this will help the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA to estimate both the total public expendi@@ ture allocated to drugs and how this is divided between different activities .
of the six countries , four ( Hungary , the Netherlands , Finland and Sweden ) provided detailed model@@ led approaches of their figures .

EU legal and policy developments
at the end of 2006 , the European Commission presented its first progress review ( 5 ) on the implementation of the EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) .
this assessed the extent to which the activities planned for 2006 were achieved and whether the plan 's objectives for 2006 have been fulfilled .

the drug programme is still being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council , in view of its adoption under the co @@@ -@@ @ decision procedure .
reports on the social cost of drug use
in June 2006 , the European Commission issued a Green Pap@@ er on the role of civil society in drugs policy in the European Union ( 6 ) , as laid down in the drugs action plan .
the aim of the Green Pap@@ er is to explore how best to organise a continuous dialogue with civil society organisations active in the drugs field .
data on the social cost of drug use are reported by only a small number of countries .
the social cost of illi@@ cit drug use was estimated at EU@@ R 9@@ 07 million in France in 2003 and at EU@@ R 2@@ 9.@@ 7 million in Luxembourg in 2004 .
in 2004 , an average 2@@ 90 drug cour@@ i@@ ers per month were arrested , decreas@@ ing to 80 per month by early 2006 .
drug testing regulation
in Ireland , substan@@ tive changes included the introduction of the Criminal Justice Ac@@ t 2006 , which sets out new offences of sup@@ plying drugs to prisoners , provisions to deal with anti@@ social behaviour and proposals to strengthen im@@ position of the 10 @@@ -@@ @ year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking drugs with a street value of EU@@ R 13 000 or more .
procedures regarding the drug testing of drivers are further described in the 2007 selected issue on drugs and driving .
this is stated to be in the interest of good order , safety , health and security , and would be carried out on samples of ur@@ ine , oral f@@ lu@@ ids and / or ha@@ ir .
procedures regarding the use of certain tools to combat drug trafficking were also established or improved .
in Estonia , the narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs and psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces Ac@@ t and Associated Ac@@ ts was amended in May 2005 to wi@@ den the scope of surveillance .
in Romania , a law implemented in June 2006 introduced the European arrest warrant and set out procedures for its use , as well as measures to improve judicial co@@ operation , surveillance and cross @@@ -@@ @ border pursu@@ it and transfer of legal procedures .
in Bulgaria , the new Pen@@ al Proc@@ ed@@ ure Code introduced in October 2005 regula@@ tes controlled delivery , confi@@ dential transactions and under@@ cover investigations .
there are also provisions for the temporary protection of witnesses in drugs cases and , in some circumstances , for protecting the identity of witnesses , as well as special rules for the questioning of such witnesses and use of under@@ cover officers .
in Norway , it is no longer the case that drug testing in the work@@ place can be carried out provided an employee or job applican@@ t gives consent .

this selected issue is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / issu@@ es@@ 0@@ 7.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u ) .
EU funding for drug @@@ -@@ @ related research is provided through research framework programmes , the most recent of which , the seventh framework programme ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 13 ) , was launched at the end of 2006 .
the EU drugs action plan 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 specifically calls on M@@ ember States to increase the provision of effective and diversi@@ fied methods of prevention , treatment , harm reduction and social re@@ integration that are easily acces@@ sible .
these fac@@ ets of the drug problem in Europe will be discussed in more detail in this chapter .
Germany , the Netherlands and Norway have extended information coverage .
Greece , Cyprus , Lithuania and Italy monitor school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention , while in Greece , Poland , Sweden and Finland , community @@@ -@@ @ based prevention services are under study , and France has set up a central@@ ised system to monitor drug prevention .
some countries ( the Czech Republic , the autonomous region of Galic@@ ia in Spain , Hungary and Norway ) are already focusing on the evidence base when funding for interven@@ tions is applied for , and are considering introducing accredi@@ tation systems .
Portugal , Finland and Romania have minimum quality criteria for prevention programmes .
most prevention programmes are not evalu@@ ated .
those that are evalu@@ ated are usually assessed in terms of the " scope and the acceptance of the intervention " rather than " the extent to which the objectives have been achieved " ( Greek national report ) .
prevention strategies can be targeted at different groups - ranging from total populations to specific risk groups - and the methods applied v@@ ary accor@@ d@@ ingly .
treatment and harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction measures are also available to drug users and drug ad@@ dicts , and in a considerable number of countries their effectiveness has been evalu@@ ated through outcome studies .
harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction measures aim to prevent drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths and to reduce health @@@ -@@ @ related harm , for example HIV or hep@@ ati@@ tis C inf@@ ections .
heroin dependence is usually treated with sub@@ stitution ther@@ ap@@ y , and special programmes have been developed for can@@ na@@ bis , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and cocaine dependence .
and , in the event of successful treatment , the next step is social re@@ integration .
as will be described below , the living conditions of many drug users are poor and social re@@ integration strategies often have to overcome considerable problems .
for each type of intervention , examples are given from different countries and research results in support of their effectiveness , or otherwise , are discussed .
these are hel@@ p@@ ful in defining good practice in prevention strategies .
in the sections below , the effectiveness of different types of prevention strategy is discussed , based on the results of this study and others .
the effects of individual prevention strategies can@@ not , in general , be meas@@ ured by changes in population @@@ -@@ @ level pre@@ val@@ ences of drug use .
however , every prevention strategy can be compared against the acc@@ um@@ ulated body of evidence , to determine whether or not it is an evidence @@@ -@@ @ based intervention .
this requires good information on the content , coverage and number of prevention interven@@ tions .
improving the available information : monitoring , quality control and evaluation
member States are increasingly monitoring prevention interven@@ tions and , as a result , are deliver@@ ing data on the
criteria com@@ mon@@ ly used to determine whether an intervention can be considered an evidence @@@ -@@ @ based practice are e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness ( Brown et al . , 2000 ; F@@ lay et al . , 2005 ) .
as a consequence , conclusions about what works can differ .
it remains a challenge to determine how to evaluate and we@@ igh the different sources of evidence in the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process .
this will be even more difficult in the case of interven@@ tions for which a comprehensive evidence base has not yet been established but the experience of which would suggest may be effective .
e@@ ffic@@ acy is a measure of how well an intervention works under ideal research conditions .
unfortunately , however , the ran@@ dom allocation of participants to either an intervention or control group is not always feasible .
effectiveness is a measure of how well an intervention works in ordinary circumstances .
frequently , interven@@ tions that have shown promise in controlled trials are implemented in the community to investigate how well they work under rout@@ ine conditions .
mass media campaigns ) to the provision of social @@@ -@@ @ emo@@ tional information ( trying to change perceptions about , for example , can@@ na@@ bis use ) .
for example , in the Netherlands a campaign put across the message " You are not ma@@ d if you are not smoking can@@ na@@ bis , because 80 % of all young people
14 do not smoke either " (
it has , however , been found to raise information levels and to lend support to policy initiatives . "
however , other evidence suggests that mass media campaigns can have positive effects if used as a supporting measure to reinforce other strategies ( Bü@@ hler and Kr@@ ö@@ ger , 2006 ) .
national drug prevention campaign in Ireland seek to disp@@ el some of the my@@ ths that sur@@ round can@@ na@@ bis , such as claims that it is " organ@@ ic " and " natural . "
environmental strategies on li@@ cit substan@@ ces
in an evaluation of Scot@@ land 's " K@@ now the score " cocaine campaign , Bin@@ ni@@ e et al .
in a few isolated cases , however , there has been a shift in emphasis from knowledge enhan@@ cement ( the aim of most
annual report 2007 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe programmes focuses on raising awareness , providing information and organising isolated events ( such as expert
16 ) , despite evidence which suggests that other visits ) ( methods may be more effective .
social influence programmes in schools are widespread , particularly in the United Kingdom and in countries offering stand@@ ardis@@ ed programmes , such as Germany , Ireland , Greece , Spain , Norway and , soon , Denmark .
such strategies are aimed at reducing consumption among young people , creating alcohol @@@ -@@ @ free zones or increasing security in night@@ life sett@@ ings .
the introduction of school norms is now receiving greater consideration in Germany , Ireland and Italy ( 15 ) .
universal prevention
as regards universal community @@@ -@@ @ based prevention , 12 M@@ ember States report that drug plans are available in most or all municipalities , and in 10 countries they are a political priority .
such sch@@ e@@ mes princip@@ ally take the form of information events and , to a les@@ ser extent , the provision of alternative le@@ is@@ ure @@@ -@@ @ time pursu@@ its .
universal family @@@ -@@ @ based prevention mostly consists of parents " even@@ ings or information approaches , and inf@@ requ@@ ently in intensive training for parents .
member States are increasingly dev@@ oting attention to prevention strategies targeted at entire vulnerable
this seems to have been achieved in almost all M@@ ember States .
once target communities have been identified ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . France recognises " sensitive urban zones " or , in the case of schools , " educational priority zones " ) , supp@@ le@@ mentary funds can be directed towards these under@@ privileged groups .
in Ireland , Cyprus and the United Kingdom , selec@@ tive prevention projects are already delivered to most of these areas , and Portugal is in the process of implementing such a strategy .
types of provision range from coun@@ selling services in Estonia , Greece , France and Slovakia to out@@ reach projects in Luxembourg and Austria , sometimes aimed specifically at ethnic groups .
furthermore , some new M@@ ember States ( Bulgaria , Hungary , Lithuania , Poland and Romania ) report much on interven@@ tions aimed at vulnerable families .
the focus in most M@@ ember States is on sub@@ stance use in the family , although a few countries ( Greece , Lithuania , Hungary , the United Kingdom ) have adopted a broader focus aimed at all socially dis@@ advant@@ aged families .
a reason frequently given for not implementing model programmes is that they would not be adap@@ table to local conditions and would not address individual communities " needs ( I@@ ves , 2006 ) .

character@@ isti@@ cs of drug users attending out@@ patient treatment
it seems that such approaches may be more effective at changing knowledge and attitudes than in changing behaviour .
access to out@@ patient treatment is easier and less selec@@ tive in most countries , it is appropriate to extra@@ po@@ late from this group of clients to drug users as a whole .
although selec@@ tive prevention is gaining in popularity , caution is required , especially when involving young people at risk in pe@@ er @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ er programmes ( Ch@@ o et al . , 2005 ; Dis@@ hion and D@@ od@@ ge , 2005 ) , because negative " Con@@ tag@@ ion effects " can occur among vulnerable groups .
these un@@ intended effects , which are caused by the intervention itself , can lead to increased sub@@ stance use or risk behaviour .
approximately half ( 53 % ) of the out@@ patient clients are treated for primary op@@ i@@ oid use and the other half for primary use of other drugs , in particular can@@ na@@ bis ( 22 % ) and cocaine ( 16 % ) .
recent developments in treatment systems
most treatment of drug users takes place in out@@ patient sett@@ ings , including general practice .
about 80 % of out@@ patient treatment clients are male , with a mean age of around 30 years ( 28 years among those new to treatment ) , and their living conditions are generally poor compared with the general population of the same age .
around 60 % of out@@ patient clients have not achieved a level of education beyond primary , and about one tenth of those clients have not even completed primary education .
countries in which national geographical coverage of specialised drug treatment facilities is very pat@@ ch@@ y include Latvia , Hungary , Slovakia and Romania .
despite recent expan@@ sions of the network of service providers , waiting lists for sub@@ stitution treatment continue to exist in Greece as well as in Hungary and Poland .
information on the soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic situation of drug clients in treatment is comple@@ mented by national information from some countries broken down by main sub@@ stance used .
new developments
residential services are , however , of growing importance in the care of elderly and long @@@ -@@ @ term drug users with complex treatment needs because of the co@@ existence of serious som@@ atic and psychological co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty .
the philosophy of in@@ patient facilities and the way they work have changed considerably over the years , in response to changing needs .
) Se@@ e the T@@ DI tables and graph@@ s in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin for more details on the figures quoted in this section .
legal fra@@ me@@ works of sub@@ stitution treatment pharmac@@ ological treatment options have been expanded to meet the needs of specific us@@ er groups with the aim of increasing treatment coverage .
for example , bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance treatment is now licen@@ sed in Malta ( 19
results were obtained from 17 countries and comple@@ mented a 2003 report from the
European legal database on drugs ( 1 ) .
the scope of the legal framework var@@ ies considerably between M@@ ember States .
there is a trade @@@ -@@ @ off between strength of the framework and f@@ lex@@ ibil@@ it@@ y@@ . flexibility .
member States are increasingly acknowledging the importance of providing adequate treatment services for problematic can@@ na@@ bis and cocaine users .
in the case of can@@ na@@ bis , treatment , coun@@ selling and prevention programmes in Europe are often inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to reach a large number of users .
new communication strategies , for example making use of the Internet , are being implemented in an attempt to reach can@@ na@@ bis users whose drug use falls somewhere between experim@@ ental and problematic .
the substan@@ ces that can be used for sub@@ stitution treatment are norm@@ ally designated by law .
in most cases , only meth@@ ad@@ one and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine or only meth@@ ad@@ one can be pres@@ cri@@ bed , although in a few countries other drugs such as mor@@ ph@@ ine or co@@ de@@ ine are per@@ mitted .
similarly , in almost all countries national admission criteria are laid down either in laws or in ministerial decre@@ es or guidelines .
the most common criteria are diagnos@@ is of addi@@ ction and minimum age , although the need for previous un@@ successful drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment also features .
in some countries , sanctions for violating treatment rules are set out in national laws while in others the issue is at the discre@@ tion of each individual treatment centre .
treatment of heroin dependence
after political endorsement as a response to heroin use in the second half of the 1980s , sub@@ stitution treatment has gone on to become the pre@@ dominant option for the treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence in most countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .
the laws usually also define who is per@@ mitted to pres@@ cri@@ be .
this is primarily doctors in treatment centres , though in some countries any doctor or certain trained or accredi@@ ted doctors may pres@@ cri@@ be .
in practice , it is rare for doctors outside treatment centres to initiate sub@@ stitution treatment ( 2 ) .
maximum dos@@ es are rarely defined in law .
to prevent du@@ p@@ licate pres@@ crip@@ tions , most countries use special pres@@ cri@@ ption forms , though a central register is found in several countries and a few issue special ID cards .
authorised dis@@ pen@@ sar@@ ies are usually also specified in the legislation , mostly pharmac@@ ies or treatment centres , though some countries also allow doctors to dis@@ pen@@ se .
finally , in most countries , a system for taking dos@@ es home has been established by law , guidelines or simply tolerance , but occasi@@ onally this is specifically for@@ bid@@ den .

national treatment outcome studies
an important feature of the studies is that they investigate treatment out@@ comes in existing services under day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day clin@@ ical circumstances .
common treatment mod@@ alities examined include meth@@ ad@@ one maintenance , meth@@ ad@@ one reduction , de@@ to@@ x@@ ification and drug @@@ -@@ @ free interven@@ tions such as ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic communities and coun@@ selling .
drug use , physical and psychological health , re@@ tention in treatment and criminal behaviour are the main outcome vari@@ ables used .
programmes and actions in many countries are not specifically aimed at drug users but address vulnerable social groups in general and are typically implemented at local or regional level .
similarly , local governments in Poland have a legal obligation to socially re@@ integrate drug users , and in the Netherlands most new social re@@ integration services are initiated by municipalities .
in Italy , the V@@ ede@@ t@@ te study ( 1998 @@@ -@@ @ 2001 ) aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment offered in public treatment centres across the country .
re@@ tention in treatment and mortality among heroin users were the main outcome vari@@ ables .
to date , three treatment outcome studies have been institu@@ ted in the United Kingdom .
the first was the National Tre@@ at@@ ment outcome Research Study ( N@@ T@@ O@@ RS ) , carried out by the National Ad@@ diction Centre in England and Wal@@ es between 1995 and 2000 .
it investigated treatment out@@ comes in residential or community treatment programmes .
there were some positive findings , such as increased rates of abst@@ in@@ ence from illi@@ cit drug use , a reduction in the frequ@@ ency of drug use , a reduction in crime and improved health .
housing assistance ran@@ ges from emergency day shel@@ ters , hos@@ tels and short @@@ -@@ @ term residential facilities to half @@@ -@@ @ way fla@@ ts , assisted accommodation and rent subsidies .
to avoid " loc@@ king " clients into longer @@@ -@@ @ term service dependence , innovative approaches in the area of supported housing or financial management are being explo@@ red .
an up@@ date of the N@@ T@@ O@@ RS study will be provided by the Dru@@ g Tre@@ at@@ ment out@@ comes Research Study ( D@@ T@@ O@@ RS ) being carried out at the University of Man@@ ches@@ ter .
the study started in 2006 and will follow drug users from across England for an initial 12 months .
it aims to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on a range of outcome measures and focuses on the analysis of which types of treatment path@@ ways produce the best out@@ comes for particular sub@@ groups of drug users .
in Scot@@ land , the Dru@@ g outcome Research Study ( Doris ) , being carried out by the University of G@@ las@@ go@@ w , started in 2001 .
this study exam@@ ines the impact and effectiveness of drug treatment services based at treatment agencies , including prison @@@ -@@ @ based services .
drug users were followed up for up to 33 months .
however , it is of particular importance for the target group as it provides not only economic stability but also self @@@ -@@ @ es@@ te@@ em , status and a regular rhyth@@ m of life .
new ways of getting clients into paid work include forming partnerships with private enterprises , ment@@ oring sch@@ e@@ mes and providing incentives such as S@@ ub@@ si@@ dis@@ ing tra@@ ine@@ es " wages or giving business start @@@ -@@ @ up loans .
in several countries , drug treatment facilities have started their own soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic enterprises , gain@@ fully emplo@@ ying their clients .
other initiatives focus on improving the employment situation through better mat@@ ching of pro@@ files , expectations and skills with the re@@ alities of work life .
it also helps to identify solutions for clients for whom occup@@ ational re@@ integration is no longer an option .
however , a large central@@ ised residential facility to accommodate 120 home@@ less drug users with psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric problems met with local objections .
for those with mental health problems , professional help to re @@@ -@@ @ establish a network of support and contact persons is identified as an important component of the social re@@ integration process .
the re@@ integration of margin@@ alised , ag@@ eing heroin users with high levels of som@@ atic and mental ill@@ ness poses a particular challenge .
in the Netherlands , a new Social Support Ac@@ t was adopted in 2007 , including drug addi@@ ction under the same regulations as ( other ) chron@@ ic psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric
in some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Slovenia ) , struc@@ tured re@@ integration programmes are provided only as a follow @@@ -@@ @ on from successfully completed abst@@ in@@ ence @@@ -@@ @ based drug dependence treatment , and specific re@@ integration measures for clients in drug maintenance treatment are currently not available .
interpre@@ ting seiz@@ ures and other market data
introduction : the changing picture of can@@ na@@ bis use in Europe
quantities seized may f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ate widely from one year to the next , for example if in one year a few of the seiz@@ ures are very large .
in all countries , the number of seiz@@ ures includes a major pro@@ portion of small seiz@@ ures at the retail ( street ) level .
where known , origin and destination of drugs seized may indicate trafficking routes and producing areas .
the price and p@@ urity / poten@@ cy of drugs at retail level are reported by most of the M@@ ember States .
however , data come from a range of different sources , which are not always compar@@ able , making accur@@ ate compar@@ is@@ ons between countries difficul@@ t@@ . cul@@ t .
can@@ na@@ bis is the world 's most com@@ mon@@ ly used illi@@ cit drug and a sub@@ stance that has been at the centre of the drugs debate in Europe since the 19@@ 6@@ 0s when its use became virtually syn@@ ony@@ mous with a growing youth counter@@ culture .
despite this famili@@ ar@@ ity , understanding the pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis use in Europe is a complicated task .
one important element in this picture is the different can@@ na@@ bis products now available on the European market . histor@@ ically , three main forms of can@@ na@@ bis have been common in Europe : can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in ; her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ; and , far less frequently , can@@ na@@ bis oil .
for many , the smoking of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in with tobacco remains the usual route of administration for the drug , though , elsewhere in the world , this pat@@ tern of use is relatively un@@ common .
while Europe remains the dominant global market for can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis products appear to be becoming more common and pre@@ dominate in some markets .
in recent years , this picture has grown more complicated still with the increasing avail@@ ability of can@@ na@@ bis produced within Europe ; some of which is grown under controlled conditions and can be of relatively high poten@@ cy .
this kind of can@@ na@@ bis has become a specific product in its own right in many countries and complic@@ ates the assessment of the public health impact of changing pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis consumption .
supply and avail@@ ability
in order to view European drug seiz@@ ures in a wider context , in this report sum@@ m@@ ary information is presented on the global situation .
the United N@@ ations Office on Dru@@ gs and Crime produce an annual report on the international drug situation and this is the principal source used for the world estimates included here .
the re@@ ader should note that there are difficulties in comp@@ iling information of this sort and , in many parts of the world , information systems are poorly developed .
therefore , these data should be viewed as the best approxim@@ ations possible from the information resources currently available .
because can@@ na@@ bis can be grown in a range of different environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , it is extremely difficult to produce convincing estimates of global production .
can@@ na@@ bis is now frequently distinguished from other illi@@ cit substan@@ ces either in the law , by prosecut@@ orial direc@@ tive , or by the judiciary practice .
in most European countries , the move has been away from cust@@ odi@@ al sentences and towards fines , cau@@ tions , prob@@ ation , exem@@ ption from punishment and coun@@ selling .
direc@@ tives to police or prosecutors were issued in : Belgium in 2003 and 2005 , France in 2005 , and the United Kingdom in 2004 and 2006 .
in 2006 , the Czech Republic almost established different classes for non @@@ -@@ @ medicin@@ al drugs , but that draft of the Pen@@ al Code was rejected for un@@ related reasons .
if can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in in Europe ten@@ ds to be a fairly uni@@ form product , the same can@@ not be said of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis .
the origin of seiz@@ ures reported in 2005 includes Albania , the Netherlands , countries of the former Yugoslavia , An@@ g@@ ola and South Africa .
although domestic production of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis is difficult to monitor system@@ atically , in 2005 , it was noted in half of the reporting countries .
some can@@ na@@ bis produced in Europe is grown out@@ doors and can be considered virtually in@@ distingu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from imported her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis .
in 2005 , global seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in totalled 1 3@@ 02 tonnes as compared to 4 6@@ 44 tonnes of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ; both tot@@ als were down on the 2004 figures .
Western and central Europe continued to account for the bul@@ k of res@@ in seized ( 70 % ) , while quantities of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seized remained concentrated in North America ( 64 % ) ( UNODC , 2007 ) .
an estimated 3@@ 03 000 seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in amounting to 9@@ 09 tonnes were made in Europe in 2005 ( 25
the can@@ na@@ bis debate remains conten@@ tious and considerable disagreement remains over the relative costs and benefits of different public health and criminal justice responses .
this is reflected in the fact that not all measures have gone in the direction of easing penalties and , in some countries , penalties have been made more severe or the current situation is under critical review .
however , this was not true for the quanti@@ ty of res@@ in inter@@ cep@@ ted , which fell in 2005 , after increasing in the period 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 04 .
can@@ na@@ bis policy remains an issue that gener@@ ates considerable public discussion and disagreement .
this can be seen in the findings of the recent Euro@@ baro@@ meter survey ( 2006 ) , which asked European citizens if they agreed with the statement that personal consumption of can@@ na@@ bis should be leg@@ alised throughout Europe .
just over two thirds ( 68 % ) of those asked disagreed and around a quarter ( 26 % ) agreed with this pro@@ position .
in all countries , although the pro@@ portion of those samp@@ led that favoured continued prohibi@@ tion var@@ ied , it was always the majority view .
for a ful@@ ler discussion see the EL@@ D@@ D topic over@@ view : h@@ tt@@ p : / / el@@ d@@ d@@ .@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / ? n@@ no@@ de@@ id = 50@@ 36

this should be checked against missing 2005 data when available .
for esti@@ m@@ ating purposes , 2005 missing data were replaced by 2004 data .
young people increased in virtually all countries . however , some of the more recent data suggest that the up@@ ward trend is lev@@ elling off , al@@ be@@ it at histor@@ ically high levels .
in 2005 , an estimated 13 500 seiz@@ ures in Europe resulted in the inter@@ cep@@ tion of about 24 million can@@ na@@ bis plants ( most of them in Turkey ) and 13.@@ 6 tonnes of can@@ na@@ bis plants ( most of it in Spain ) .
overall , the number of seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis plants in Europe shows a continuous up@@ ward trend since 2000 .

however , there are still differences between countries in meth@@ od@@ ology and year of data collection , and small differences between countries should be interpreted with caution ( 1 ) .
as surveys are expensive to conduct , few countries collect information annually .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available , which in most cases will be between 2003 and 2006 .
however , reported average or typical prices for both types of can@@ na@@ bis ran@@ ged from EU@@ R 2 per gram to over EU@@ R 15 .
mean prices of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , correc@@ ted for inflation , fell over the period 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 05 in all reporting countries except Poland , where prices remained stable .

three measures of drug use over time are com@@ mon@@ ly used for reporting survey data . lif@@ etime use or pre@@ val@@ ence is the bro@@ ade@@ st .

despite this wide overall range , 12 European countries out of the 26 that provided information reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence rates in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ( 32
if attention is restricted to young people in the 15@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year age range , pre@@ val@@ ence estimates for lif@@ etime use range between 3 % and 44 % ( with most countries reporting figures in the range 20 @@@ -@@ @ 40 % ) .
last @@@ -@@ @ year pre@@ val@@ ence rates range from 4 % to 28 % ( in most countries 10 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % ) ; and last month pre@@ val@@ ence rates are between 1 % and 19 % ( in most countries 5 @@@ -@@ @ 12 % ) .
among mal@@ es in this age group , pre@@ val@@ ence estimates are higher still .
pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis use
moving the point of reference from lif@@ etime to last year , the levels of reported can@@ na@@ bis use fall but still remain considerable .
estimates suggest that more than 23 million European adults have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year , producing an average figure of about 7 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
again , despite the wide overall range , 13 out of the 25 countries that provided information reported last year pre@@ val@@ ence estimates between 4 % and 9 % ( F@@ ig@@ ure 3 ) .
as noted above , the use of can@@ na@@ bis , as with most other illegal drugs , is notably higher among younger people , although even here considerable country vari@@ ation can be found .
use is also notably higher among mal@@ es than among fem@@ al@@ es , although this difference ten@@ ds to be less pronounced for young people .
estimates of last month pre@@ val@@ ence will include people using can@@ na@@ bis more regularly , although not necessarily in an intensive way .
it is estimated that 13.@@ 4 million Europeans adults used the drug in the previous month , on average about 4 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
country figures range between 0.5 % and 8.@@ 7 % .
the lowest figures were reported by Bulgaria , Malta , Lithuania and Sweden , and the highest from Spain ( 8.@@ 7 % ) , Italy ( 5.@@ 8 % ) , the United Kingdom ( 5.2 % ) and France ( 4.@@ 8 % ) .
of the 26 countries that provided information , figures from 13 countries fall within the range 2 % to 6 % ( 33 ) .
for many , can@@ na@@ bis use ten@@ ds to be dis@@ continued after a short experim@@ ental period and rates of use generally decline as individuals grow older .
tr@@ acking the care@@ ers of can@@ na@@ bis users in the available data and identi@@ fying changes over time in consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns is , however , difficult .
some in@@ sight into this issue can be gained by compar@@ ing reported lif@@ etime use with more recent consumption measures .
) The average pro@@ portion was compu@@ ted as the average of national pre@@ val@@ ence rates weigh@@ ted according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
total numbers were compu@@ ted by multi@@ plying pre@@ val@@ ence among the population concerned in each country and , in countries for which no information was available , imp@@ ut@@ ing the average pre@@ val@@ ence .

the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is currently working closely with a number of M@@ ember States on the development of a better meth@@ od@@ ological approach to this issue .
it is planned that this esti@@ mation can be up@@ dated in the near future .
another important information need in this area is to better understand the factors associated with dis@@ continuing use .
) There is as yet no uni@@ vers@@ ally accepted defin@@ ition of " intensive can@@ na@@ bis use . "
it is , however , a broad term meaning use of can@@ na@@ bis that exceeds a certain threshold of frequ@@ ency .
it does not necessarily imply the existence of " dependence / abuse " or other problems , but it is considered to increase the risk of negative consequences , including dependence .
in this chapter , figures refer to " daily or almost daily use " ( defined as use on 20 or more days out of the last 30 days ) .
this bench@@ mark has often been used in studies and can be der@@ ived from the European model questionnaire .
ongoing meth@@ od@@ ological studies ( national and E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) will help to understand better relationships between intensive / frequent use and problems ( see box on developing psy@@ cho@@ metric scal@@ es , P . 42 ) .
in France , a " regular consumer " is defined as using the drug " 10 times or more in the last 30 days " ( 4.3 % of ad@@ ult mal@@ es , 1.3 % of ad@@ ult fem@@ al@@ es ) .
in the United Kingdom , " frequent use " is considered " use more than once per month in the last year , " and is not compar@@ able with measures used in this section .
developing psy@@ cho@@ metric scal@@ es to identify intensive , dependent and problematic can@@ na@@ bis use in survey data there are important tempor@@ al differences between countries and waves of popularity ob@@ serv@@ able in the use of the drug since it began to become popular in the 19@@ 6@@ 0s ( 38 ) .
an example of this is data from Sweden ( 2005 Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national report ) where a relatively high level of experim@@ entation was reported in the 197@@ 0s among cons@@ cripts and school students , followed by a substantial decrease in the 1980s , and then a new rise during the 1990s to levels similar to those of the 197@@ 0s followed by a subsequent decrease in more recent years .
Des@@ crip@@ tions on drug use from surveys are based on self @@@ -@@ @ reported behaviour over different time inter@@ vals .
histor@@ ically , daily use has not been monitored system@@ atically , in part because in most countries the pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use was low .
and , the approach of restric@@ ting attention to use in the last month does not allow estimates of the number of intensive users to be made with any prec@@ ision .
however , as can@@ na@@ bis use has increased across Europe and concerns about can@@ na@@ bis problems have grown , this approach has had to be re@@ considered .
in fact , nearly all EU countries now collect information on how many days the drug has been used in the month prior to interview .
based on this information , it is estimated that around 3 million people may be using can@@ na@@ bis daily or almost daily .
however , this still provides only a b@@ lun@@ t tool for identi@@ fying those who are suffering problems or dependence because of their use of can@@ na@@ bis .
an example here is the United Kingdom , which in general terms often appears to be a " fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner " in respect to drug @@@ -@@ @ use trends .
during the early 1990s , the United Kingdom stood out as a high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence country , reporting on most measures the highest pre@@ val@@ ence figures in Europe .
however , last year pre@@ val@@ ence levels among young adults ( 16 @@@ -@@ @ 34 ) stabil@@ ised from 1998 and have fallen between 2003 and 2006 ( 20.@@ 0 % to 16.@@ 3 % ) .
levels of can@@ na@@ bis use in France , Spain and Italy have all began to approach the United Kingdom pre@@ val@@ ence levels in recent years ( 2002 , 2003 and 2005 respectively ) , following a period of steady increases .
in the Czech Republic , a country with high pre@@ val@@ ence rates , trends are difficult to assess within the data available - although the information for young adults suggests that pre@@ val@@ ence levels may have fallen slightly .

tr@@ acking trends in drug use in Europe is made difficult by the absence in many countries of reliable time series data .
however , an increasing number of countries have launched surveys from the 1990s on@@ wards , and these are now beginning to provide valuable in@@ sight into trends over time .

in Sweden the situation appeared stable and slight decreas@@ es were noted in the other four surveys .

the increase in the demand for can@@ na@@ bis treatment does not appear to have a simple explanation .
there are differences between countries in the frequ@@ ency of can@@ na@@ bis use , with half of the countries reporting more than 30 % of clients as daily can@@ na@@ bis users and the other half with less than 30 % .

although the extent to which this is a problem remains unclear , it remains an important question for planning services in this area .
responding to can@@ na@@ bis problems
in some of the programmes , the ori@@ entation is as much towards prevention and harm reduction as towards the treatment of drug problems .
France provides an example of a specialised service for can@@ na@@ bis users where 250 can@@ na@@ bis consultation centres have been created in 2005 .
qu@@ asi @@@ -@@ @ comp@@ ul@@ sory interven@@ tions
identi@@ fying those at risk and interven@@ ing early is recognised as an important component of all drug programmes , and teaching staff may be among the first to identify can@@ na@@ bis among their pupils .
Germany , Italy and Poland all have developed programmes for teachers that help them respond to can@@ na@@ bis use and seek specialist help when this is appropriate .
for can@@ na@@ bis users referred from court services , treatment interven@@ tions are not the only kind of response noted .
new communication strategies for eng@@ aging with can@@ na@@ bis users
no strong evidence base exists to inform can@@ na@@ bis treatment practice , and research studies in this area are limited and mainly based on American and Australian experiences .
in Europe , the most common reported approaches to can@@ na@@ bis problems include : short @@@ -@@ @ term out@@ patient services , coun@@ selling , school @@@ -@@ @ based programmes and out@@ reach prevention activities .
generally , interven@@ tions appear to be based on brief @@@ -@@ @ intervention approaches using a combination of motiv@@ ational inter@@ viewing and cogn@@ itive @@@ -@@ @ behavi@@ our@@ al elements .
although no strong consensus exists on what constitu@@ tes effective practices , some studies have suggested this kind of approach can be useful .
one European initiative in this area is the In@@ can@@ t project , where Belgium , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Switzerland have co@@ operated on expl@@ oring the value of multi@@ dimen@@ sional family ther@@ ap@@ y ( M@@ D@@ FT ) with can@@ na@@ bis users .
concerns have been raised that it may be in@@ appropriate to treat young can@@ na@@ bis users in general drug services if this leads to clients
a number of innovative programmes in Europe attempt to explo@@ it new communication tools for eng@@ aging with can@@ na@@ bis users .

the pre@@ val@@ ence of ec@@ st@@ asy use in the EU has been increasing since the 1990s .
in many European countries , the second most com@@ mon@@ ly used illi@@ cit sub@@ stance is some form of syn@@ the@@ tically produced drug , although on a European scale , there are now more users of cocaine .
the use of these substan@@ ces among the general population is typically low , but pre@@ val@@ ence rates among younger age groups are significantly higher , and in some social sett@@ ings or cultural groups the use of these drugs may be particularly high .
g@@ lob@@ ally , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines ( amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ) and ec@@ st@@ asy are among the most pre@@ valent syn@@ thetic illi@@ cit drugs .

amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine : differences and simil@@ ar@@ ities
amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine seized in Europe is reported to come mainly from Belgium , the Netherlands and Poland , and to a les@@ ser extent from Estonia and Lithuania .
both substan@@ ces are central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ants , which share the same mechanism of action , behavi@@ our@@ al effects , tolerance , withdrawal and prol@@ on@@ ged use ( chron@@ ic ) effects .
g@@ lob@@ ally , 12.@@ 9 tonnes of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine was seized in 2005 , most of it in two regions : Western and central Europe and east and south @@@ -@@ @ east Asia .

in 2005 , an estimated 40 300 seiz@@ ures of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , amounting to 6.@@ 6 tonnes , were made in Europe .
until 2004 , the United Kingdom has consistently accounted for the greatest number of seiz@@ ures and the largest quantities of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine inter@@ cep@@ ted in Europe .
despite some f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ations , at European level , both the overall number of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine seiz@@ ures and quantities seized have increased since 2000 ( 54 ) .

cocaine is also directly imported into other countries , with the Netherlands remaining a key entry point .
both Spain and the Netherlands are regarded as main distribution centres for the drug .
imports from outside Europe are also reported by a number of other countries including Belgium , Germany , France and the United Kingdom ; and distribution may also be diversi@@ fying , with reports of increased activity through eastern and central Europe and both EU and neighbouring countries sometimes now reported as secondary transit locations .

in 2005 , 3@@ 42 tonnes of op@@ ium , 32 tonnes of mor@@ ph@@ ine and 58 tonnes of heroin were seized worldwide .
Asia ( China , Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan ) continued to account for the greatest quantities of heroin ( 54 % ) seized worldwide , followed by Europe ( 38 % ) ( UNODC , 2007 ) .
heroin consu@@ med in Europe is predominantly manufac@@ tured in Afghanistan , which remains the world leader in illi@@ cit op@@ ium supply , followed by M@@ yan@@ mar .
it is estimated that about 6 6@@ 10 tonnes of op@@ ium was produced in 2006 , 92 % of which in Afghanistan .
this represents a 43 % increase compared to the 2005 estimate , due to a substantial increase in the area under cultiv@@ ation .

this transla@@ tes into some 1.5 million ( 1.3 @@@ -@@ @ 1.7 million ) problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the EU and Norway .
however , these estimates are far from robust and more extensive data are required .
detec@@ ting trends in both price and p@@ urity is hampered by a lack of consistent data , and estimates are therefore based on only a limited range of countries ( 1@@ 18 ) .
most countries reported average or typical street price of bro@@ wn heroin in the range EU@@ R 35 @@@ -@@ @ 80 per gram .
between 2000 and 2005 mean heroin prices , correc@@ ted for inflation , appear to have decreased in most of the 18 countries providing compar@@ able data .
the mean p@@ urity of heroin products has been f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ating in most of the 18 reporting countries since 2000 .
a lack of reliable historical data complic@@ ates the assessment of trends over time in problem op@@ i@@ oid use and trends should thus be interpreted with caution .
reports from some countries suggest that problem op@@ i@@ oid use may , on average , have stabil@@ ised somewhat in recent years .
data from repeated estimates on problem op@@ i@@ oid use for the period between 2001 and 2005 are only available from eight countries and provide a relatively stable picture with only one country ( Austria ) showing a clear increase ( 120 ) .
moreover , as most studies are based on a lo@@ cal@@ ised geographical area , such as a city or district , extra@@ po@@ lation to generate national estimates is difficult .
E@@ sti@@ mation is also complicated as pat@@ ter@@ ns of problem drug use in Europe appear to be becoming more di@@ verse .

treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence
over the past 15 years , the provision of treatment for heroin dependence has seen large increases in the EU .
according to available data , this is mainly due to a more than se@@ ven@@ fold increase of sub@@ stitution treatment provision in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States , since 1993 .

generally , the consensus in this area is that it is good practice to integrate programmes into the wider framework of medical care and social assistance .

many countries have taken these concerns seriously , and Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom all report that re@@ views are under way with the objective of improving the quality of care provided .
similarly , Denmark has recently completed a three @@@ -@@ @ year project to document the impact of wider psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial support in sub@@ stitution treatment and to test quality assur@@ ance processes .
one reason for interest in the use of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is that it is arguably a more su@@ itable pharmaceutical option than meth@@ ad@@ one for use in community practice .
this issue is a complex one and is discussed in detail in the 2005 selected issue on bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine .
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is mar@@ ke@@ ted in the form of sub@@ lin@@ gual tab@@ lets , and although it is not considered a particularly attractive sub@@ stance to in@@ ject , reports exist that tab@@ lets have been dis@@ solved and in@@ j@@ ected .
the potential for misuse of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is supported by reports from some countries of the di@@ version of the drug onto the illi@@ cit market .
to de@@ ter illi@@ cit use of bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , a new formu@@ lation of the drug , in combination with n@@ alo@@ x@@ one , has been developed .
this formu@@ lation , Su@@ box@@ one , received a European marketing author@@ isation in 2006 .
the avail@@ ability of national clin@@ ical guidelines , standards and treatment protocols is important in ensuring the quality of sub@@ stitution treatment .
in the Netherlands , maintenance treatment is now increasingly realised according to medical treatment standards , and administration of meth@@ ad@@ one is supervised during the first phase of treatment .
a national monitoring system for reporting on clients in sub@@ stitution treatment programmes also provides information useful for assessing the quality and avail@@ ability of services .
overall , the number of clients receiving heroin in Europe is very small , and treatment is usually reserved for particularly chron@@ ic cases where other ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic options have proved un@@ successful .
the e@@ ffic@@ acy of heroin as a sub@@ stitution ag@@ ent has also been explo@@ red in experim@@ ental research in both Spain ( March et al . , 2006 ) and Germany ( Nab@@ er and Ha@@ as@@ en , 2006 ) .
together with earlier work , these studies on heroin pres@@ cri@@ ption have stimu@@ lated debate about the need for this treatment option to be more widely available .
information available from the treatment demand indicator ( T@@ DI ) does not cover all people in drug treatment , which is a considerably greater number ; only clients requ@@ esting treatment during the reported year are recorded , but a pilot project is currently being implemented in 2007 , aiming to extend the European data collection to treatment clients in continuous treatment ( 1@@ 23 ) and assess reporting coverage of national systems .
the European Medi@@ cin@@ es Agency ( E@@ M@@ EA ) is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for European marketing author@@ isation for medicin@@ al products .
medicin@@ es approved through the central@@ ised procedure obtain a single marketing author@@ isation which is valid in all M@@ ember States of the European Union .
all authorised medicin@@ al products are also monitored for safety .
this is conducted through the EU network of national medicin@@ es agencies , in close co@@ operation with healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical companies themselves .
in many countries , op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , mainly heroin , remain the principal drug for which clients seek treatment .
some countries report a significant pro@@ portion of treatment demands relating to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin .
in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , around 4 % of clients are reported as primary meth@@ ad@@ one users .
in Spain , Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 7 % of drug clients are entering treatment for primary use of un@@ specified op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one ( 125 ) .
and in Hungary , where the use of home @@@ -@@ @ made op@@ ium pop@@ p@@ y products has a long history , around 4 % of treatment requests are related to op@@ ium .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA collec@@ ts two types of information to describe treatment in Europe .
the treatment demand indicator is based on the monitoring of character@@ isti@@ cs of clients entering treatment across Europe .
in addition , M@@ ember States are asked to provide data that describes the overall structure and avail@@ ability of services .
data from the treatment demand indicator
most op@@ i@@ oid users are reported by out@@ patient treatment units ; however , in Sweden 71 % of op@@ i@@ oid clients are reported by in@@ patient centres , indicating that services are differ@@ ently struc@@ tured in this country .
a small percentage ( 3 % ) of in@@ patient treatment demands for op@@ i@@ oid clients is also reported by the United Kingdom ( 126 ) .
in the few countries reporting data on treatment demand in low @@@ -@@ @ threshold agencies , a significant pro@@ portion of drug clients seek treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use ( 1@@ 27 ) .
see T@@ able T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 1@@ 14 in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin . )
see T@@ able T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 1@@ 19 in the 2007 statistical bul@@ letin . )
in the EU M@@ ember States and Norway , in 2005 , it is estimated that the number of drug sub@@ stitution treat@@ ments was at least 5@@ 85 000 . this estimate is based on treatment monitoring carried out in most countries and provides a general picture of service avail@@ ability .
for EU countries where estimates of problem op@@ i@@ oid use were available for 2005 , the extent of sub@@ stitution treatment among problem op@@ i@@ oid users was calculated ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 ) .
results show significant differences between countries , with rates var@@ ying from under 10 % ( Slovakia ) to about 50 % of op@@ i@@ oid users ( Italy ) .
however , the data does suggest the need to review the avail@@ ability of treatment options in all countries in order to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet estimated needs .
this represents a more than se@@ ven@@ fold increase since 1993 , when sub@@ stitution cases were estimated to be around 73 000 ( Far@@ rell , 1995 ) .
in 2005 , stabilisation in the number of clients in sub@@ stitution treatment was reported in the Netherlands ( 1@@ 22 cases per 100 000 inhabitants ) and Luxembourg ( 3@@ 55 cases per 100 000 ) .
the pro@@ portion of clients seeking treatment for op@@ i@@ oid use var@@ ies between countries .
based on the most recent data available , op@@ i@@ oid users make up 40 @@@ -@@ @ 70 % of all treatment demands in 12 countries , less than 40 % in seven countries and more than 70 % in six countries ( 130
the percentage of all drug treatment demands accounted for by all heroin requests has fallen , decreas@@ ing from 74 % in 1999 to 61 % in 2005 . the only countries not reporting a decrease are Bulgaria and the
United Kingdom ( 1@@ 31 ) .
these increases coinci@@ ded with a geographical expansion of the avail@@ ability of sub@@ stitution treatment option in many of these countries .
in two countries with a history of high levels of provision , Spain and Malta , provision has recently decreased , possibly reflecting overall levels of demand in these countries .
the inter@@ relationship between repeat treatment demands , maintenance levels and the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use is complex .
the levels of clients " repeat treatment demands and the numbers of clients in drug maintenance programmes is determined by historical developments in op@@ i@@ oid use inci@@ dence and pre@@ val@@ ence , as well as treatment service organisation and type .
for a few countries , it
the absolute decrease of new op@@ i@@ o@@ ids treatment demands , mainly due to heroin use , is confirmed by looking at the trend of new heroin clients : all the countries , except Bulgaria and Greece , report a decrease in the pro@@ portion of new requests for primary heroin use among new drug clients in the last seven years .

however , while the data provided by either of these two systems should be interpreted with caution , taken together , they provide a more complete picture of recent ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological trends .
the available data suggests that , by 2005 , in most countries , rates of new infection related to I@@ D@@ U@@ s were low .
a c@@ av@@ eat to this analysis is that in several high @@@ -@@ @ pre@@ val@@ ence countries , recent case reporting data is not available ( Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria ) .
in 19 M@@ ember States , most of which have never experienced large HIV ep@@ i@@ dem@@ ics among I@@ D@@ U@@ s , rates of reported I@@ D@@ U @@@ -@@ @ related cases remained under five cases per million population in 2005 .
higher figures were reported by Ireland and Luxembourg , with 16 and 15 new cases per million respectively .
in Latvia , Lithuania and probably also in Estonia , rates of reported new I@@ D@@ U @@@ -@@ @ related inf@@ ections have strongly declined since the ep@@ i@@ demic pe@@ aks in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 02 , although they are still high in comparison with most other countries .
in Latvia , the rate has dropped from 2@@ 83 new cases per million in 2001 to 49 per million in 2005 .
in Lithuania , after an outbreak among prisoners , a peak observed in 2002 ( 109 per million ) has been followed by a decrease to 25 new cases per million in 2005 .
although there has been a strong decline in HIV infection in Estonia , the country still reports the highest rate of new HIV inf@@ ections in the EU .
and , while I@@ D@@ U @@@ -@@ @ specific data are not available for Estonia , drug in@@ j@@ ecting is likely to remain a major transmission route for HIV in this country .
HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among young and new I@@ D@@ U@@ s
an important indicator of the number ( inci@@ dence ) of new inf@@ ections among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users is provided by case reports of newly diagnos@@ ed HIV inf@@ ections .
in interpre@@ ting this data , a number of consider@@ ations should be bor@@ ne in mind : infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s may not be diagnos@@ ed if they are not in contact with health services ; new inf@@ ections may not necessarily be attributed to drug in@@ j@@ ection ; and , the number of cases
support for the conclusions drawn from the available case reporting data can be found by analy@@ sing levels of HIV infection in samples of new I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( those in@@ j@@ ecting less than two years ) and young I@@ D@@ U@@ s ( those under age 25 ) .

overall , these local or national level increases in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence suggest that compla@@ cen@@ cy concerning the provision of prevention measures to I@@ D@@ U@@ s should be avoided .
in mind that the size of these subs@@ amp@@ les is , in general , small and that HIV ser@@ op@@ re@@ val@@ ence data on young and new I@@ D@@ U@@ s is not available from some countries .
trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence
increasing HIV pre@@ val@@ ences in repeated samples of I@@ D@@ U@@ s may also indicate ongoing inf@@ ections - although dec@@ lines in mortality of infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s or decreas@@ ing numbers of un@@ infected I@@ D@@ U@@ s can be important con@@ fo@@ unders .

the most vulnerable sections of the population suffer dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately from these conditions .
among prison populations , in particular , drug problems are often common and levels of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases relatively high .
moreover , drug use often continues or , sometimes , is initiated in prison ; and in this setting , high @@@ -@@ @ risk behavi@@ ours can be common .
for the prevention of hep@@ ati@@ tis A and B , vacc@@ ination has an important role to play .

drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths ref@@ ers to those that are caused directly by the consumption of one or more drugs .
the number of deaths from other causes indirectly related to drug use ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . hep@@ ati@@ tis , violence , suicide or accidents ) is more difficult to assess .
mortality related to other forms of drug use ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . cocaine ) would add to this figure , but is more difficult to quanti@@ fy .
" drug @@@ -@@ @ indu@@ ced deaths " and " ac@@ ute drug deaths " ( 15@@ 5 ) .
the number of drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths in a community will depend on the number of people using drugs associated with over@@ d@@ ose ( particularly op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ) .
other factors that will also be important include : the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , pre@@ val@@ ence of pol@@ y@@ drug use , avail@@ ability and policy of treatment services and emergency services .
determining the overall level of mortality resulting from problem drug use at a national or European level will require advances in data collection and analysis .
an attempt at such an exercise on a national scale is reported in the Dutch national report .
by extra@@ po@@ la@@ ting data from a local study , the mortality rate due , directly and indirectly , to problem drug use was estimated , taking into account regional differences .
ac@@ ute deaths related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids
although the compar@@ ability of European data has improved in recent years , differences in the quality of reporting between countries still mean that direct compar@@ is@@ ons should be made with caution .
the extent of drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths can be expressed in terms of the number of cases reported , by population rates or by propor@@ tional mortality .
these figures should be considered as a minimum estimate ( 15@@ 6

over@@ d@@ ose deaths due to cocaine are more difficult to identify than those caused by op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , and are often considered to be the result of a combination of causes , rather than from cocaine to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity itself ( 16@@ 6 ) .
in Europe , reports of deaths with cocaine involved usually also mention the presence of other substan@@ ces ( including alcohol and op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ) , reflecting the use of cocaine in combination with other drugs .
among the countries sup@@ plying data , over 400 cocaine deaths were identified in both the 2006 and 2005 national reports .
there is a clear need to investigate further the health consequences and mortality related to cocaine use .
trends in ac@@ ute drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths

psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders are com@@ mon@@ ly related to problematic drug use .

s@@ chi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia and suic@@ id@@ al ten@@ den@@ cies are also mentioned .
similarly , drug dependence is common among people with serious mental ill@@ ness .
the European project Is@@ ad@@ ora ( " integrated services aimed at dual diagnos@@ is and op@@ ti@@ mal recovery from addi@@ ction " ) was concluded in 2005 after a three @@@ -@@ @ year research period ( 1 ) .
easier acces@@ sibility of treatment and greater variety of approaches , including sub@@ stitution treatment , improve rates of re@@ tention in treatment , which makes an important contribution to reducing drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths and mortality .
a long@@ itu@@ din@@ al study on the effectiveness of treat@@ ments for heroin addi@@ ction , which will examine the association between re@@ tention in treatment and mortality , is currently under@@ way in Italy ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2006 ) .
in the first few weeks after leaving prison or treatment those who have withdrawn from op@@ i@@ oid drugs are at an ele@@ v@@ ated risk of an over@@ d@@ ose , if they rela@@ p@@ se back into drug use - as their previous tolerance will be reduced .
continuity of care with social support and treatment services can play an import role here , especially for those leaving prison .
research suggests that con@@ current use of other drugs , particularly alcohol and sed@@ ative drugs , may increase the risk of fatal op@@ i@@ oid over@@ d@@ ose and , therefore , pol@@ y@@ drug use is an important issue for services to address .
this approach has not been widely developed in Europe to date , but may have potential .
an approach that has generated some controversy is the provision of drug consumption rooms , where@@ by drug users may consum@@ e their drugs in a designated space where
drug consumption rooms have been criticised by the IN@@ C@@ B in their recent annual reports , but are viewed by some EU M@@ ember States as a useful component of their responses to some forms of highly problematic drug use .
consumption rooms are sometimes also viewed as an opportunity to limit public n@@ u@@ is@@ ance caused by the use of drugs .
information , education and communication ( I@@ EC ) techniques are used throughout Europe in initiatives that aim to reduce drug @@@ -@@ @ related deaths .

one has only to consider the wor@@ rying developments resulting from the trans@@ iting of cocaine through West Africa to be reminded of the col@@ lateral damage that this problem can cause .
we are proud to present this , the thir@@ teen@@ th , annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction .
this report is only possible through the hard work and dedic@@ ation of our partners in the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x network of national fo@@ cal points and the experts throughout Europe who have contributed to the analysis .
we also are indebted to those EU agencies and international organisations working in the drugs field .
our report is a collective en@@ deavour and we than@@ k all those who have contributed to it .
the ration@@ ale behind this work is that a co@@ ol @@@ -@@ @ headed analysis of what we know about the drug situation is a condition for an informed , productive and reas@@ oned debate .
it ensu@@ res that opinions are en@@ ligh@@ tened by facts , and that those making difficult policy cho@@ ices can have a clear understanding of the costs and benefits of the options available .
on a positive note , drug use in Europe appears to be stabil@@ ising , and progress can be noted in the way in which EU M@@ ember States are addressing this issue .
for most forms of drug use , our overall assessment is that we are not seeing increases , and in some areas the trends appear to be down@@ ward .
in terms of responses , we have seen virtually all M@@ ember States adopt a strategic approach , and greater co@@ hesion is visible at the European level .
not many years ago , HIV infection among drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors was a central concern in the dru@@ g@@ policy debate .
since then , a pragm@@ atic mi@@ x@@ ture of prevention , treatment and harm@@ reduction measures has become the nor@@ m in Europe , and rates of new infection attributed to drug use have fallen and continue to do so .
it is grati@@ fying to note that , by international standards , Europe stands out as one of the parts of the world where monitoring capacities are most developed .
non@@ e@@ theless , we are aware of the limit@@ ations of our current information resources , and are constantly working with our partners to improve the quality and re@@ lev@@ ance of the data available .
good news makes poor head@@ lines and can be over@@ looked .
however , it is important to recognise progress where it has been made .
increasingly , in Europe , we have an understanding of what measures can be effective in addressing drug problems .
an acceptance that our activities can , and do , make a difference is a prerequisite to securing investment and policy support .
this is not to say that our report does not highlight many areas of concern for the European Union .
examples include the continuing increases in cocaine use and the considerable differences that still exist between countries in the avail@@ ability and quality of services for those with problems .
we must therefore conclude that , even if progress has been made , the journey remains far from finished .
however , today in Europe , more than at any time in the past , we have a stronger agreement on the direction we should take .
an under@@ lying theme of the policy debate on drugs is the costs , both hidden and more visible , of Europe 's drug problem .
this issue is addressed in various parts of this report .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has been working to develop an understanding of the public expenditures associated with tackling drug use in EU M@@ ember States .
this work is in its inf@@ ancy , and estimates der@@ ived are indic@@ ative rather than precise .
non@@ e@@ theless , they point to considerable sum@@ s being spent , with preliminary figures of between EU@@ R 28 billion and EU@@ R 40 billion .
less easy to express in economic terms is the harm caused by drug use .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA would like to than@@ k the following for their help in producing this report :
• the heads of the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points and their staff ;
• the services within each M@@ ember State that collected the raw data for this report ;
• the members of the Management Board and the Scientific Committee of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ;
• the European Parliament , the Council of the European Union - in particular its Hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal Wor@@ king Party on Dru@@ gs - and the European Commission ;
• the European Centre for Dis@@ ease Preven@@ tion and Control ( EC@@ DC ) , the European Medi@@ cin@@ es Agency ( E@@ M@@ EA ) and Europol ;
• the P@@ om@@ pi@@ dou Group of the Council of Europe , the United N@@ ations Office on Dru@@ gs and Crime , the WHO Regional Office for Europe , Interpol , the World Customs Organisation , the ES@@ PA@@ D project and the Swedish Council for Information on Al@@ co@@ hol and other Dru@@ gs ( C@@ AN ) , and the European Centre for the E@@ pi@@ dem@@ i@@ ological Monitoring of AIDS ( Euro@@ HIV ) ;
• the Trans@@ lation Centre for the Bo@@ dies of the European Union and the Office for Official Pub@@ lic@@ ations of the European Commun@@ ities .
Re@@ it@@ o@@ x is the European information network on drugs and drug addi@@ ction .
the network is comprised of national fo@@ cal points in the EU M@@ ember States , Norway , the candidate countries and at the European Commission .
under the responsibility of their governments , the fo@@ cal points are the national authorities providing drug information to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
the contact details of the national fo@@ cal points may be found at : h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / about / partners / re@@ it@@ o@@ x @@@ -@@ @ network
this annual report is based on information provided to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA by the EU M@@ ember States and candidate countries and Norway ( participating in the work of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA since 2001 ) in the form of a national report .
the statistical data reported here rela@@ te to the year 2006 ( or the last year available ) .
graph@@ ics and tables in this report may reflect a sub@@ set of EU countries : the selection is made on the basis of those countries from which data are available for the period of interest .
retail prices of drugs reported to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA reflect the price to the us@@ er .
for p@@ urity or poten@@ cy and retail prices , all analy@@ ses are based on typical ( mo@@ dal ) values or , in their absence , mean ( or medi@@ an ) values .
reports of the pre@@ val@@ ence of drug use based on general population surveys mostly refer to the national population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years .
in reports on treatment demand , " new clients " ref@@ ers to those who have entered treatment for the first time in their lives and " all clients " ref@@ ers to all those entering treatment .
clients in continuous treatment at the start of the year in question are not included in the data .
where the pro@@ portion of treatment demands for a primary drug is given , the denomin@@ ator is the number of cases for which the primary drug is known .
analysis of trends is based only on those countries providing sufficient data to describe changes over the time period in question .
figures for 2005 may sub@@ stitute for missing 2006 values in trend analysis of drug market data ; for the analysis of other trends , missing data may be inter@@ po@@ lated .
trends in price are ad@@ jus@@ ted for inflation at national level .
the term " reports " for drug law offences may describe different concep@@ ts in different countries .
further information on the data and analy@@ tical methods is available in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
the annual report is available for down@@ lo@@ ading in 23 languages ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / public@@ ations / ann@@ u@@ al@@ report / 2008 ) .

commen@@ tary The drug situation in Europe - new per@@ spec@@ tives and some old re@@ alities
a strong voice from Europe in an important year for ref@@ le@@ ction and policy formation the us@@ er is often difficult , and M@@ ember States v@@ ary greatly in how they have drawn the line between these two categories .
during the past five years , the number of reported drug law offences has increased in Europe .
in Europe , 2008 has seen the evaluation of the 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 drug action plan , together with work to prepare a new plan to take forward the EU drug strategy during its second period ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
at the same time , 13 M@@ ember States are red@@ raf@@ ting or re@@ viewing their national drug strategies or action plans .
this makes 2008 an unprecedented year for European and global reflec@@ tions on how drug policies have performed to date , and what direc@@ tions should be pursu@@ ed in the future .
however , the view held by some that , for drug users and particularly can@@ na@@ bis users , the lik@@ elihood of being charged with drug offences has decreased in recent years is not supported by the data .
furthermore , the extent to which sanctions applied for drug possession have changed is not clear , and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA will explore this question in a selected issue next year .
new survey explo@@ res young people 's attitudes to drug use
a growing European consensus can be seen in the way M@@ ember States have adopted national drug strategies and in their contribution to the global debate on drugs .
EU M@@ ember States , supported by the Commission , have put forward an increasingly united EU position in the ongoing discussions that have accompanied the Un@@ gas@@ s review .
drug use and the application of criminal sanctions : a mixed picture
this distinc@@ tion has been reflected in a reduction of penalties for drug use in some countries , though others have rejected moves to reduce penalties or have even increased them .
a recent Euro@@ baro@@ meter survey explo@@ red young people 's attitudes and perceptions on drugs and found considerable consensus among countries .
overall , the risks associated with using drugs such as heroin , cocaine and ec@@ st@@ asy were rated as high by between 81 % and 96 % of those surveyed .
the vast majority of respondents ( 95 % ) felt that these drugs should continue to be controlled in Europe .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
drug use prevention : evidence base gro@@ ws but practice is slow to change up employment is one of the key elements of achieving re@@ integration in to society , and it has been shown to be of high pro@@ gn@@ os@@ tic value .
this situation is changing as the scientific basis for drug prevention continues to grow and more rigor@@ ous studies are carried out .
together , the information now available allows for a greater understanding of what types of activities are likely to prove effective and how to target those most at risk .
nevertheless , new data suggests that in many countries , the pre@@ dominant approaches are often still those that lack a strong evidence base and , in some cases , include activities that may even be counter@@ productive .
the challenge for policymakers may be that those programmes that are known to deliver benefits often require both a greater investment of resources and more attention to training and quality control .
an important challenge for drug treatment services in Europe is the need to develop models of care ta@@ il@@ ored to the needs of a more het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous population of drug users .
it is therefore likely that European drug treatment services will have to develop an increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated set of responses in the future if they are to match the increasingly differ@@ enti@@ ated needs of their clients .
the portal , which includes a prevention mo@@ dul@@ e , provides an over@@ view of the latest evidence on programme e@@ ffic@@ acy and effectiveness as well as tools and standards aimed at improving the quality of interven@@ tions .
examples of evalu@@ ated practices across Europe are also provided .
drug treatment : more emphasis on out@@ comes and client needs
recent data from school and ad@@ ult population surveys suggest that overall can@@ na@@ bis use has stabil@@ ised or is declining in some countries .
the number of drug users receiving treatment for their dependency has grown considerably in recent years , and many countries now have a significant pro@@ portion of their problem op@@ i@@ oid users in long @@@ -@@ @ term sub@@ stitution treatment .
this trend has led to a wi@@ den@@ ing of the available pharmaceutical options and has resulted in an increased focus on treatment quality and outcome , as opposed to treatment up@@ take , as a primary policy concern .
dec@@ lines in pre@@ val@@ ence are most apparent among younger age groups .
commen@@ tary : the drug situation in Europe
at a g@@ lance - estimates of drug use in Europe
the estimates presented here rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
for the complete set of data and information on the meth@@ od@@ ology see the accompan@@ ying statistical bul@@ letin .
lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence : at least 71 million ( 22 % of European adults )
last year use : about 23 million European adults or one @@@ -@@ @ third of lif@@ etime users now visible , and is most evident in the 16 @@@ -@@ @ 24 age group .
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.@@ 8 % to 1@@ 1.2 %
lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence : at least 12 million ( 3.6 % of European adults )
last year use : 4 million European adults or one @@@ -@@ @ third of lif@@ etime users
last month use : around 2 million
lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence : about 9.@@ 5 million ( 2.8 % of European adults )
last year use : over 2.@@ 6 million or one @@@ -@@ @ third of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : more than 1 million
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.2 % to 3.5 %
lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence : almost 11 million ( 3.3 % of European adults )
last year use : around 2 million or one @@@ -@@ @ fifth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths accounted for 3.5 % of all deaths of Europeans 15 @@@ -@@ @ 39 years old , with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids being found in around 70 % of them
principal drug in around 50 % of all drug treatment requests
more than 600 000 op@@ i@@ oid users received sub@@ stitution treatment in 2006
the extent and relative market share of dome@@ sti@@ cally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis remains unknown , and in response to this the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is carrying out a study on m@@ apping the can@@ na@@ bis market in Europe .
there is also a growing debate about the implications of the evol@@ ving can@@ na@@ bis market .
concerns being voiced include the negative impact of can@@ na@@ bis production sites on local communities through increased levels of crimin@@ ality , and that dome@@ sti@@ cally produced can@@ na@@ bis is typically of high poten@@ cy .
local production also poses a challenge for law enforcement bodies , as production sites are located close to the consumer , relatively easy to conce@@ al and do not necess@@ itate the transportation of drugs across national borders .
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe was@@ tes resulting from syn@@ thetic drug production can be considerable .
cocaine trafficking through west Africa : an area of concern and action population of problem drug users in Europe , but also among the better socially integrated groups of young people who use drugs on a more rec@@ re@@ ational basis .
however , pat@@ ter@@ ns of sti@@ mul@@ ant use differ across Europe : cocaine is now the most com@@ mon@@ ly used sti@@ mul@@ ant in many countries in the south and west of Europe , and its use continues to grow .
Meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use remains rare outside the Cz@@ ech@@ Republic and Slovakia , although the avail@@ ability or use of the drug is spor@@ adi@@ cally reported by other countries .
as cocaine use continues to rise in Europe , increased efforts are being focused on cocaine inter@@ diction .
both the volume and number of cocaine seiz@@ ures continue to increase , with annual seiz@@ ures now in exc@@ ess of 120 tonnes , of which more than three quarters are accounted for by Spain and Portugal .
this would imply that , as well as targeting individual substan@@ ces , interven@@ tions need to consider sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs as a group rather than only as individual problems .
although cocaine enters Europe by a number of routes , trafficking through west African countries has dramatically increased and now represents a major route for cocaine dest@@ ined to the European market .
this situation has the potential to destabilise and undermine development efforts in a region already facing many social , health and political challenges .
in particular , the income generated by cocaine trafficking has considerable potential to undermine criminal justice systems and encourage corruption .
the European Union and its M@@ ember States are working together with west African countries to develop a range of measures to address this growing threat .
developments in syn@@ thetic drug production in Europe increases concerns about environmental costs
heroin problems not dimin@@ ishing alongside reports of increased use of syn@@ thetic op@@ i@@ o@@ ids
the most recent estimates show that , at an estimated 7@@ 33 tonnes , potential global heroin production has continued to increase .
however , the impact of this increase on the avail@@ ability and use of this drug in Europe is difficult to ga@@ uge .
the available data make drawing conclusions in this area difficult .
for example , the quanti@@ ty of heroin seized in the European Union has declined slightly , but this has been counter@@ balanced by considerable increases in Turkey .
typically , the production of one kilo@@ gram of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or M@@ D@@ MA results in around 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 kilo@@ gram@@ s of waste material , including to@@ xic and inf@@ lam@@ m@@ able chem@@ ic@@ als which constitute an environmental haz@@ ard .
commen@@ tary : the drug situation in Europe the relative pro@@ portion of op@@ i@@ oid users - but not their actual numbers - had been falling , but this trend now appears to have lev@@ elled out .
however , there remain important differences between countries .
data from regional or local studies also suggest that transmission of HIV infection remains an issue in Spain and Italy , although the absence of national case reporting data makes tr@@ acking trends in these countries difficult .
Dru@@ g@@ related deaths : a major burden on public health
perhaps counter @@@ -@@ @ in@@ tu@@ iti@@ vely , given the situation in Afghanistan , problems with both di@@ ver@@ ted and il@@ lic@@ it@@ ly produced syn@@ thetic op@@ i@@ o@@ ids appear to be increasingly common in some countries .
in Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , for example , there are indic@@ ations of a growing problem caused by the avail@@ ability of 3 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ yl@@ f@@ ent@@ any@@ l that is il@@ lic@@ it@@ ly manufac@@ tured outside the EU .
drug in@@ j@@ ecting and HIV : overall picture positive but important national differences
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA monitors fatal po@@ is@@ on@@ ings directly attri@@ but@@ able to drug use ( drug @@@ -@@ @ indu@@ ced deaths ) .
there are , on average , around 7 000 @@@ -@@ @ 8 000 dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths reported in Europe each year , and due to known under@@ reporting this figure represents a minimum estimate .
O@@ pi@@ o@@ ids , princip@@ ally heroin , are the drugs most often associated with over@@ d@@ ose , although other drugs and alcohol are com@@ mon@@ ly present .
after falling for some years in the early part of this decade , the trend in dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths has now lev@@ elled out .
the reasons for this are unclear , indicating a need for more research on both the factors associated with over@@ d@@ ose and on the effectiveness of prevention measures .
drug users leaving prison may be at particular risk , with a recent study reporting mortality rates eight to ten times higher than expected .
overall , over@@ d@@ ose prevention remains an area requiring increased investment .
Studies have also shown that overall mortality , when diseases , accidents and violence are also taken in to consideration , among drug users is up to fif@@ ty times higher than that found among the general population .
in some countries , particularly in eastern Europe , drug in@@ j@@ ection remains the principal route of heroin administration and is reported by over 80 % of heroin users entering treatment .
relatively high levels of initi@@ ation also appear to be still oc@@ curr@@ ing in some M@@ ember States , as indicated by studies among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users that show a relatively high pro@@ portion of young and new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
reports suggest that the number of online retailers of these products is growing and that they adap@@ t rapidly to attempts to control the market , for example through the launch of new products .
in addition , online pharmac@@ ies and online retailers selling psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces for os@@ ten@@ sibly legitimate purposes also potentially provide new av@@ en@@ ues for illi@@ cit drug supply .
taken together , Internet sales now represent a considerable challenge to both international and national drug policies and control mechanisms .
given the speed at which new products can appear and be distributed , the monitoring of online activities is becoming an important area for development .
growing recognition of the importance of dialogue with civil society
drug problems are inter@@ tw@@ ined with a range of other social and health issues .
consequently , successful interven@@ tions in this area require the involvement of a broad alliance of participants and can benefit from the support of the communities in which they are implemented .
less positively , this progress has not been accompanied by a compar@@ able increase in the co@@ operation and Co@@ ordination of dru@@ g@@ related research efforts among EU M@@ ember States .
chapter 1 Polic@@ ies and laws
introduction themselves to achieving meas@@ ur@@ able results in reducing the supply and demand for illi@@ cit drugs by 2008 .
Dru@@ g@@ policy is set to be an important issue in 2008 .
in this year , both the United N@@ ations and the European Union assess the results of their drug policies on the use of , and har@@ ms caused by , illi@@ cit drugs .
in Europe , 2008 sees the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) and the drafting of the action plan for 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 .
furthermore , an unprecedented number of EU M@@ ember States also review their national drug strategies and action plans and draft new dru@@ g@@ policy documents ( 1 ) during this year .
this assessment is to be followed by a one @@@ -@@ @ year ref@@ le@@ ction period , during which discussions will first be held among inter@@ governmental expert working groups and then in inter@@ ses@@ sional meetings .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA will discuss the findings and developments made during 2008 in its next annual report .
the chapter ends with an over@@ view of dru@@ g@@ related research in EU M@@ ember States .
the European Union is playing an active role in the Un@@ gas@@ s review .
Un@@ gas@@ s 10 @@@ -@@ @ year review
evaluation of the EU action plan on drugs
in June 1998 , the 20th UN General Assembly Special S@@ ession ( Un@@ gas@@ s ) conven@@ ed in New York to debate the world drug problem .
this " drug summit " set a new agenda for the international community through the adoption of three key documents ( 2
in December 2007 , the European Commission presented its second progress review on the implementation of the EU action plan on drugs ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) .
it also highlighted difficulties in collecting data
chapter 1 : policies and laws
new developments on supply @@@ -@@ @ reduction activities and in linking some of the planned actions with the indicator chosen to assess their implementation .
the final evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs took place in 2008 , with in@@ put from the EU M@@ ember States , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA .
new drug action plans or programmes were adopted by four EU M@@ ember States ( Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Finland ) , Turkey and Norway in the second half of 2007 .
all of these documents cover a time sp@@ an of three to four years and , with the exception of the Turkish action plan , they have been prece@@ ded by previous plans or programmes .
in the same year , Spain also adopted a comple@@ mentary national action programme against cocaine ( 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 10 ) .
other EU developments
in early 2008 , three more M@@ ember States adopted new policy documents .
Italy 's first drug action plan has a time frame of one year , and is to be followed by a four @@@ -@@ @ year action plan ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) , which will be syn@@ chron@@ ised with the new EU action plan on drugs .
Malta 's first ever national dru@@ g@@ policy document , while not defining the time frame , includes almost 50 actions to be implemented in the coming years .
under the programme , EU@@ R 2@@ 1.@@ 35 million will be available for Commission studies , operational costs of European non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations in the drugs field , and trans@@ national projects .
Norway continues to be one of the excep@@ tions to this pat@@ tern , with illi@@ cit drugs and alcohol fully integrated in its recently adopted action plan .
in June 2006 , the European Commission issued a Green Pap@@ er on the role of civil society in drug policy , as called for in the current drug action plan .
this was followed in 2007 by the selection process for a new civil society forum on drugs .
the forum includes 26 organisations representing a wide spectrum of views .
it met for the first time in December 2007 and again in May 2008 to discuss the evaluation of the current EU action plan on drugs and the new action plan .
see the 2006 selected issue European drug policies : extended beyond illi@@ cit drugs ?
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
some examples of this diversity are highlighted in C@@ hap@@ ter 2 .
in 2008 , 13 EU M@@ ember States have already red@@ raf@@ ted or are due to review and red@@ ra@@ ft their national dru@@ g@@ policy documents , making this a year of unprecedented activity in policy@@ making at national level .
following Italy , Malta and the United Kingdom , Ireland will ren@@ ew its drug strategy in 2008 ; France , Portugal and Romania will ren@@ ew their drug action plans ; Bulgaria , Spain , Cyprus , Lithuania and Slovakia will ren@@ ew both their drug strategies and their action plans .
no national dru@@ g@@ policy document
single national dru@@ g@@ policy document
two comple@@ mentary national dru@@ g@@ policy documents
Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
EU M@@ ember States differ , however , in their methods and approaches for evalu@@ ating national drug strategies and action plans ; and there is a need to identify best practices in this field .
this was highlighted at a conference on evaluation organised by the Portuguese Presidency of the EU in September 2007 .
to respond to this challenge , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , in collaboration with M@@ ember States , is expl@@ oring the possibility of developing European guidelines in this field .
Dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture
in 2000 , when the European Union used this approach for the first time , only two M@@ ember States had two comple@@ mentary dru@@ g@@ policy documents .
however , as European countries differ in their drug problem as well
chapter 1 : policies and laws countries highlights the need to adopt a common approach towards monitoring the social cost of drug use in Europe .
eleven M@@ ember States gave details of expendi@@ ture by the State on certain activities undertaken in response to the drug problem .
a further two countries provided roug@@ h estimates of overall public expendi@@ ture related to the drug problem ( Spain , Malta ) , though with no information on the activities on which the money was spent .
in addition , it was estimated that drug users spent EU@@ R 3 9@@ 80 million for the purchase of illi@@ cit drugs .
on the basis of these data , the cost of drug use in Italy is estimated to represent 0.@@ 7 % of the national gross domestic product .
in 2005 , the total dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture by European countries was calculated to lie somewhere between EU@@ R 13 billion and EU@@ R 36 billion ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .
this figure was estimated by extra@@ po@@ la@@ ting the total dru@@ g@@ related expenditures of six countries ( Belgium , Hungary , Netherlands , Finland , Sweden , Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ) to the other States .
a revised estimate , which includes data from additional countries ( Czech Republic , France , Luxembourg , Poland , Slovakia ) , has recently been proposed ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ d ) .
this suggests that State expendi@@ ture on the drug problem costs the average EU citizen EU@@ R 60 a year .
these figures must , however , still be taken as indic@@ ative because of the limited data on which they are based .
reports on the social cost of drug use
data on the social cost of drug use ( direct and indirect costs caused by drug use ) were reported by four M@@ ember States .

a selected issue on this topic gives an over@@ view on the overall figures on dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture in 2005 in the EU M@@ ember States and Norway .
most of the expenditures identified were originally " la@@ bel@@ led " as drug related , and were generally tr@@ ac@@ ed back by exha@@ us@@ tively re@@ viewing official accoun@@ tancy documents , thus possibly reflecting the voluntary engagement of the States in the field of drugs .
when feasible , hidden or " un@@ la@@ bel@@ led " expenditures em@@ bed@@ ded in programmes with broader goals were estimated through model@@ ling techniques .

asks the question : do the changes in legal defin@@ itions and responses to drug users indicate a new , wider trend in how countries view users of drugs ?
possession for personal use
however , during this period , not all countries have been reducing penalties : France and Poland decided not to change their laws after consultations ; and Denmark raised the " normal " penalties from cau@@ tions to fines ( which were then increased ) .
in the United Kingdom , it has been announced that can@@ na@@ bis is to be rec@@ las@@ sified up@@ wards .
however , M@@ ember States differ considerably in how they have chosen to define these categories in the new laws that they have adopted in recent years .
the changes in drug users " access to treatment via the criminal justice system typically share two common features . first , they all wi@@ den the scope for direc@@ ting drug users in to treatment .
in the period 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , Bulgaria removed the concept of personal possession , Italy re @@@ -@@ @ enacted it after 12 years without , and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom enacted the concept but then chose not to apply it .
in 2005 , in Slovakia , the legal defin@@ itions of personal use were wi@@ dened from a maximum of one d@@ ose to a maximum of three and , for a larger amount , 10 dos@@ es .
in Ireland and Malta , following arrest , drug users can now be referred to treatment ; this is also the case in the United Kingdom , where drug testing on arrest is authorised in certain circumstances . special drug courts have been established
chapter 1 : policies and laws controlled by new laws : trains and ships in Ireland ; boats in Latvia ; aviation in Finland .
the Netherlands aims to increase the use of treatment as a condition of early release from prison .
when deemed appropriate , in Finland , sentenced offen@@ ders can now be directed towards an open prison if they stay dru@@ g@@ free ; in Greece , they may be sent to a special treatment unit .
in Belgium , at all levels of the criminal justice process , alternatives exist to di@@ ver@@ t drug @@@ -@@ @ using offen@@ ders in to treatment .

though these data are usually taken as indirect indicators of drug use or drug trafficking , it is important to note that they reflect differences in national legislation and the different ways in which the laws are applied and enforced .
the measures that reduce criminal penalties for personal use or offer alternatives to punishment , described above , are part of this development .

national dru@@ g@@ related research specifically designated for dru@@ g@@ related research can be available through national drug Co@@ ordination bodies ( Czech Republic , Spain , France , Luxembourg , Hungary , Poland , Portugal , Norway ) .
both types of funding programmes often couple research on illi@@ cit drugs with other areas within the addi@@ ction field , such as alcohol , tobacco and g@@ amb@@ ling .
the funds are mostly available through contracts for commissioned research or through framework programmes to which researchers apply .
other types of funding sources reported include foundations , scientific academ@@ ies , private institutions , special funds for the fight against drugs , the European Commission and the United N@@ ations .
structures and projects
based on reports from 25 M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway , it is possible to give an over@@ view of the organisation of dru@@ g@@ related research in European countries .
Co@@ ordinating and funding
national research networks were reported by some countries ( Germany , Spain , Portugal ) .
these can play an important role in the organisation and funding of research , and may also promote more direct links between research and practice .
in 15 of the 27 reporting countries , structures to co@@ ordinate dru@@ g@@ related research exist at national level .
also cited were studies in determin@@ ants , risk and protec@@ tive factors for drug use , consequences of drug use , and drug mechanisms and affects .
constra@@ ints to dru@@ g@@ related research were reported by several countries .
among the problems identified were : organis@@ ational aspects , such as a lack of Co@@ ordination and sc@@ at@@ tered resources ( Germany , France , Austria ) ; the

chapter 2 responding to drug problems in Europe - an over@@ view
introduction
improving the monitoring of drug supply reduction
this chapter presents an over@@ view of the responses to drug problems in Europe , where possible highligh@@ ting trends , developments and quality issues .
the set of measures reviewed here includes prevention , treatment , harm@@ reduction and social re@@ integration , which taken together form a comprehensive demand @@@ -@@ @ reduction system .
the chapter also includes a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
in addition , future monitoring challenges in another field of drug policy , drug supply reduction , are brief@@ ly discussed .
drug supply reduction can be defined as en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing all activities aimed at preventing illi@@ cit drugs from reaching users .
law enforcement activities , alternative development initiatives and projects aimed at preventing dru@@ g@@ related crime all contribute to reducing the supply of illi@@ cit drugs .
monitoring and analysis constitute , as is the case with drug demand reduction , an important support for these activities and their evaluation .
drug prevention can be divided in to different levels or strategies , from environmental to indicated prevention , which ide@@ ally do not compete but comple@@ ment each other .
activities related to international projects are usually well documented , while data on activities at national level are often difficult to access and compar@@ e .
the European Commission , Eurostat , Europol and the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA are working to improve this situation in the framework of the next EU action plan on drugs ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) .
existing concep@@ tual fra@@ me@@ works and information systems , as well as potential information sources for monitoring and analy@@ sing supply reduction activities in the M@@ ember States , are to be reviewed .
there is also a need to better understand drug markets , in particular supply and distribution arrangements , both in their economic and social dimen@@ sions .
two studies funded by the European Commission will explore both the information systems and sources on drug supply reduction and the international drug markets .
the objectives of universal school @@@ -@@ @ based drug prevention in Europe appear to have shif@@ ted in recent years .
the changes in reported objectives may reflect the adoption of a more r@@ ational and evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based approach , but the extent to which this change in objectives reflects actual provision is unclear .
the effectiveness of these interven@@ tions is unclear .
in contrast , some of the more strongly evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based interven@@ tions are reported in only a few countries .
these include stand@@ ardis@@ ed programmes , pe@@ er approaches or interven@@ tions specifically for boys ; all of which aim
data were provided by national experts in the M@@ ember States .

full provision : the intervention is available in almost all locations where the size of the target population is sufficient for its implementation .
in addition , the following categories of interven@@ tions were each reported by four countries : addressing social dis@@ advantage ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . unemployment ) , helping with criminal justice problems , or assisting margin@@ alised families from ethnic minorities .
furthermore , only three countries address the needs of families cop@@ ing with mental health problems .
risk conditions of young vulnerable groups , for example , young offen@@ ders , home@@ less , tru@@ ant , dis@@ advant@@ aged and minority youth , are also rarely addressed despite increasing political importance .
since 2004 , an increasing number of drug policies have indicated them as primary targets for prevention interven@@ tions , but the reported level of intervention provision has not increased during this period .
more detailed data a represented in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups of young people .

e@@ ffic@@ acy and risks of interven@@ tions
such individuals include school dro@@ p@@ outs , and those with psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders , anti@@ social behaviour or early signs of drug use .
drug use among children and in families remains the main focus of targeted prevention in Europe .
several research studies have shown that interven@@ tions delivered during the early school years , aimed to improve educational environ@@ ments and reduce social exclu@@ sion , also have a moder@@ ating effect on later sub@@ stance use ( T@@ ou@@ m@@ bour@@ ou et al . , 2007 ) .
the overall effectiveness of school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention has been questioned ( Co@@ gg@@ ans , 2006 ; Gor@@ man et al . , 2007 ) .
recent literature re@@ views ( 19 ) , however , show that certain
children with behavi@@ our@@ al dis@@ orders , such as co@@ existing attention deficit ( hy@@ per@@ activity ) dis@@ order and conduct dis@@ order , are at high risk of developing sub@@ stance use problems .
interven@@ ing early with children with behavi@@ our@@ al dis@@ orders requires close co@@ operation between medical , social and youth services .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA " Best practice " portal content of prevention projects .
in the Czech Republic , for instance , certi@@ fication of preven@@ tive activities is a condition for receiving subsidies from the State budget .
this section aims to provide an over@@ view of drug treatment in Europe , describing the organisation and provision of services .
the first mo@@ dul@@ e of the portal focuses on universal prevention , in particular on evidence of e@@ ffic@@ acy which is based on several re@@ views published since 2000 .
for details of the findings , see the portal ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / themes / best @@@ -@@ @ practice ) .
the portal provides information on the e@@ ffic@@ acy of various interven@@ tions , but it should be noted that the evidence base remains sometimes limited and that making cho@@ ices between different interven@@ tions requires caution .
furthermore , as controlled trials measure the e@@ ffic@@ acy of programmes , how certain interven@@ tions will perform in different sett@@ ings remains subject to question .
the new edition of the E@@ D@@ D@@ RA dat@@ aban@@ k , available on the portal , features examples of evalu@@ ated interven@@ tions in different countries and sett@@ ings , and may provide additional gu@@ idance .
General practi@@ tion@@ ers also play an important role , and in some countries are key providers of sub@@ stitution treatment .
the private sector can also be involved in some countries , mainly in residential care .
nevertheless , funding for drug treatment is mostly provided by the public pur@@ se or is linked to social or health insur@@ ances .
the " Un@@ p@@ lu@@ gged " programme used in the trial challenged norms about the acceptance and beli@@ efs about the pre@@ val@@ ence of sub@@ stance use among youth .
this is particularly important for universal school @@@ -@@ @ based prevention , which is delivered to a large and di@@ verse target population .
for instance , providing information about drug effects alone , a widespread approach in Europe , is not only in@@ effective but may carry risks of un@@ wanted effects ( W@@ er@@ ch and O@@ w@@ en , 2002 ) .
the same applies to mass @@@ -@@ @ media campaigns , which can carry risks of increasing the pro@@ pen@@ s@@ ity for sub@@ stance use ( 21 ) .
out@@ patient sett@@ ings , including general practice , account for most of the treatment for drug use in Europe , mainly because sub@@ stitution treatment is usually delivered in these sett@@ ings .
around one third refer themselves to treatment , 22 % are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system , with this figure growing in recent years , and the remaining are referred through social and health services or through informal networks ( 23 ) .
one way to ensure that prevention programmes are evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based and that risks of un@@ wanted effects are reduced is to develop standards for the delivery and
half of the clients entering treatment in out@@ patient sett@@ ings reported primary op@@ i@@ oid use , while 21 % cited can@@ na@@ bis and 16 % cocaine as their primary drug . increases in the

however , the overall avail@@ ability of services specifically targeted to the needs of non @@@ -@@ @ op@@ i@@ oid drug users remains limited .
treatment in in@@ patient sett@@ ings takes place mostly in ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic communities , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric hospitals and specialised departments in general hospitals .
the services provided range from short @@@ -@@ @ term de@@ to@@ x@@ ification to prol@@ on@@ ged psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric and abst@@ in@@ ence @@@ -@@ @ based treatment programmes .
the pro@@ portion
in Hungary , where N@@ SP@@ s and out@@ reach work have been increasing , a study among the out @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ treatment population suggests that provision is still insufficient and access barriers are high .
due to the specific profile of the Bal@@ tic States and Romania with regard to HIV / AIDS , international donors continue to play an important role in these countries .
financial support for harm@@ reduction activities is provided by the Global Fund " Programme to fight against AIDS , malar@@ ia and tub@@ er@@ cul@@ osis , " while in Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia , UNODC has recently launched the project " HIV / AIDS prevention and care among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users and in prison sett@@ ings . "
histor@@ ically , drug @@@ -@@ @ treatment services have been organised around the needs of op@@ i@@ oid users , who still represent the main group of users in treatment .
in Turkey , sub@@ stitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is per@@ mitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres .
after meth@@ ad@@ one , bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is the second most com@@ mon@@ ly pres@@ cri@@ bed op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitute , and its use in the treatment of op@@ i@@ oid dependence has increased in recent years ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) .
finally , some M@@ ember States have recently looked at the consequences of the introduction of harm@@ reduction interven@@ tions .
the prevention and reduction of dru@@ g@@ related harm is a public health objective in all M@@ ember States and in the EU drug strategy and action plan ( European Commission , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .
such dis@@ advantage ten@@ ds also to be more widespread among specific groups

of users , particularly women , heroin and cr@@ ack users , those who belong to ethnic minorities and those with co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric problems .
Studies carried out between 2001 and 2006 in Europe show that between 1 % and 56 % of in@@ mates report having used drugs within prison , and up to a third of in@@ mates have in@@ j@@ ected drugs while in custody ( 32 ) .
helping drug treatment clients find employment is a key element in social re@@ integration , as one in every two clients entering treatment is unemployed ( 28 ) .
health and social responses in prison
prisons represent an important setting for the delivery of health and social interven@@ tions to drug users .
the prison population in the European Union is over 6@@ 07 000 ( 33 ) , with an estimated annual turnover of more than 8@@ 60 000 prisoners .
from the data available , it can be estimated that more than 400 000 people with past or current experience of illi@@ cit drug use pass through EU prisons every year .
see T@@ able T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 15 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
see T@@ able T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 20 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
the term " prisoners " is used in a broad sense here , and includes both on @@@ -@@ @ re@@ mand and convicted inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated persons .
in addition , these interven@@ tions have become more widely available within countries .
prison @@@ -@@ @ based sub@@ stitution treatment is officially available in all countries except Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Cyprus , Slovakia and Turkey , though , in many countries , the overall acces@@ sibility of this treatment option is limited .
Spain is currently the only European country that provides a wide range of harm@@ reduction measures in prisons .
the responsibility for healthcare in prison lies , in most countries , with the Ministry of Justice .
however , this is changing , and in a growing number of European countries , the responsibility has been transferred to the health system ( France , Italy , England and Wal@@ es in the United Kingdom , Norway ) .
compared to five years ago , more countries now report activities in the following
in 2006 , only four M@@ ember States reported soci@@ o@@ demographic data and information on drug use pat@@ ter@@ ns of prisoners in drug treatment through their national treatment monitoring systems .
recent legislation on drug treatment in prison
in 2006 and early 2007 , six countries revised their legal fra@@ me@@ works and guidelines affecting prisoners " rights to drug treatment .
in Belgium , a 2006 direc@@ tive from the Ministry for Justice states that in@@ mates have the right to the same range of treatment options as are available outside prison .
in Denmark , a change in the law from January 2007 enti@@ t@@ les imprisoned drug users to free treatment for their drug use .
the law stipulates that the treatment should norm@@ ally start within 14 days of the prison@@ er requ@@ esting it from the Danish P@@ ris@@ on and prob@@ ation Service .
however , there is no such enti@@ t@@ lement if the offen@@ der is expected to be released within three months or is considered un@@ fit or not motivated for treatment .
more specifically , in Slovakia , a 2006 law per@@ mitted the provision of psychological services to drug users on re@@ mand who are suffering from withdrawal symp@@ t@@ oms .
the aim of this law is to provide drug users with such services at the time when they are most needed , at the time of enforced withdrawal immediately upon entering custody .
it also created a legislative framework to support the existing special treatment units for convicted drug users .
drug supply and avail@@ ability - data and sources
systematic and rout@@ ine information to describe illi@@ cit drug markets and trafficking is still limited .
production estimates of heroin , cocaine and can@@ na@@ bis are obtained from cultiv@@ ation estimates based on fi@@ el@@ d@@ work ( sam@@ pling on the ground ) and a@@ erial or satellite surveys .
these estimates have some important limit@@ ations linked , for instance , with vari@@ ations in yield figures or with the difficulty of monitoring crops which are not grown in restricted geographical areas , like can@@ na@@ bis .
data on p@@ urity or poten@@ cy and retail prices of illi@@ cit drugs may also be analy@@ sed in order to understand retail drug markets .
however , the avail@@ ability of this type of data may be limited and there may be questions of reli@@ ability and compar@@ ability .
intelligence information from law enforcement agencies may help complete the picture .
in the early and mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s a few countries stood out as having a high pre@@ val@@ ence , whereas the European nor@@ m was levels of use which , by today 's standards , were low .
moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @@@ -@@ @ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for can@@ na@@ bis @@@ -@@ @ related problems .
Europe may now be moving in to a new phase , as data are pointing to a stabil@@ ising or even decreas@@ ing situation .
levels of use remain high by historical standards , however ; what constitu@@ tes an effective response to can@@ na@@ bis use remains a key question in the European debate on drugs .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA collec@@ ts national data on drug seiz@@ ures , p@@ urity and retail prices in Europe .
other data on drug supply comes largely from UNODC 's information systems and analy@@ ses , comple@@ mented by additional information from Europol .
information on drug prec@@ ur@@ sors is obtained from the IN@@ C@@ B , which is involved in international initiatives to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als used in the manufac@@ ture of illi@@ cit drugs .
( Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports ) . her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in Europe is also reported to come from other parts of the world , including : West and southern Africa ( Ni@@ ger@@ ia , An@@ g@@ ola ) , south @@@ -@@ @ east Asia ( Tha@@ il@@ and ) , south @@@ -@@ @ west Asia ( Pakistan ) and the Americ@@ as ( Col@@ om@@ bia , J@@ am@@ a@@ ica ) ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; Europol , 2008 ) .
can@@ na@@ bis can be cultiv@@ ated in a wide range of environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world , and it is currently believed that the plant is cultiv@@ ated in 17@@ 2 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2008 ) ( 34 ) .
these facts taken together mean that producing estimates of the worldwide production of can@@ na@@ bis with any prec@@ ision is likely to be very difficult .
the widespread cultiv@@ ation of can@@ na@@ bis also means that a significant pro@@ portion of trafficking is likely to be in@@ tr@@ are@@ gi@@ onal .
this is the case for some her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in
Europe , where in addition to home production ( 35
the area under can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in production declined from 13@@ 4 000 hectares in 2003 to and the Netherlands have been noted as source countries
for information on the sources of data for drug supply and avail@@ ability , see the box on this page .
can@@ na@@ bis production in Europe
76 400 hectares producing 1 0@@ 66 tonnes in 2005 ( UNODC and Government of Mor@@ oc@@ co , 2007 ) .
res@@ in production is also reported in Afghanistan , where it is rising rapidly , Pakistan , India , N@@ ep@@ al , and Central Asian and other C@@ IS countries ( UNODC , 2008 ) .
can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in produced in Mor@@ oc@@ co is typically smuggled in to Europe via the I@@ ber@@ ian peninsula ( Europol , 2008 ) , with some of it being further distributed from the Netherlands .
in 2006 , 52 30 tonnes of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis and 10 25 tonnes of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in were seized worldwide , down from peak levels in 2004 .
north America continued to account for the bul@@ k of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seized ( 58 % ) , while quantities of res@@ in seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 62 % ) ( UNODC , 2008 ) .
available information is pat@@ ch@@ y and does not allow an accur@@ ate assessment of the extent of can@@ na@@ bis cultiv@@ ation in Europe .
nevertheless , reports from a num@@ ber@@ of@@ countries suggest that it may no longer be viewed as margin@@ al .
for example , French population surveys in 2005 estimated that about 200 000 people had grown can@@ na@@ bis at least once in their lif@@ etime .
in the Netherlands , can@@ na@@ bis cultiv@@ ation is widespread in some parts of the country , with an estimated total of 6 000 cultiv@@ ation sites disman@@ tled in 2005 and 2006 .
in Europe , an estimated 17@@ 7 000 seiz@@ ures of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis , amounting to 86 tonnes , were made in 2006 ( 36 ) .
the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom is the EU M@@ ember State reporting the most seiz@@ ures of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis , though data are not yet available for 2006 .
Turkey reported seiz@@ ures of record amounts of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in 2006 .
the number of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seiz@@ ures in Europe has increased steadily since 2001 , while there has been an overall decrease in the quanti@@ ty seized , until 2005 , with an increase noted in the most recent data .
in some countries , it seems that a majority of users are now consum@@ ing loc@@ ally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis .

seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in in Europe exceed her@@ bal seiz@@ ures both in terms of number and quanti@@ ty : with twice as many seiz@@ ures ( 3@@ 25 000 ) and the amount inter@@ cep@@ ted ( 7@@ 13 tonnes ) eight times higher .
after a period of stabilisation in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 03 , the number of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seiz@@ ures is increasing in Europe , while the quantities inter@@ cep@@ ted increased until 2003 @@@ -@@ @ 04 , but there@@ after have been declining .

annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
population surveys : an important tool for understanding pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends of drug use in Europe
surveys also provide useful Con@@ tex@@ tual information on pat@@ ter@@ ns of use , soci@@ o@@ demographic character@@ isti@@ cs of users and perceptions of risks and avail@@ ability ( 1 ) .
in 2006 , the reported TH@@ C content of res@@ in samples ran@@ ged from 2.3 % to 18.@@ 4 % , while that of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ran@@ ged from under 1 % to 13 % .
however , there are still differences between countries in the meth@@ od@@ ology used and year of data collection , and this means that small differences , in particular between countries , should be interpreted with caution ( 3 ) .
it is conserv@@ atively estimated that can@@ na@@ bis has been used at least once ( lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence ) by more than 70 million Europeans , that is over one in five of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ ye@@ ar@@ - ol@@ ds ( see T@@ able 2 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA standard age ran@@ ges are : all adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years ) and young adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) .
generally being reported among the 15@@ - to 24 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
many countries report comparatively high pre@@ val@@ ence levels of last year and last month use of can@@ na@@ bis .
estimates of last month pre@@ val@@ ence will include those using the drug more regularly , though not necessarily in an intensive way ( see below ) .
population survey data suggest that , on average , 31 % of young European adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) have ever used can@@ na@@ bis , while 13 % have used the drug in the last year and 7 % have used it in the last month .
it is estimated that even higher propor@@ tions of Europeans in the 15 @@@ -@@ @ 24 age
see T@@ ables P@@ P@@ P @@@ -@@ @ 1 and P@@ P@@ P @@@ -@@ @ 5 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin for poten@@ cy and price data .
group have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year ( 17 % ) or last month ( 9 % ) , though on average slightly fewer among this age group have tried the drug ( 30 % ) .
can@@ na@@ bis use is higher among mal@@ es than among fem@@ al@@ es ( see the 2006 selected issue on gender ) , although marked differences between countries are observed .
for example , the rati@@ o of mal@@ es to fem@@ al@@ es among those reporting use of can@@ na@@ bis in the last year ran@@ ged from 6.@@ 4 mal@@ es for each female in Portugal to 1.3 in Italy .
as with lif@@ etime experience , there is a wide vari@@ ation between countries in estimates of use in the last 30 days among school students .
in some countries it is virtually un@@ reported , whereas in others around 15 % of those questioned report use during the last 30 days , with sometimes even higher figures found among mal@@ es .
after tobacco and alcohol , can@@ na@@ bis also continues to be the psy@@ cho@@ active sub@@ stance most com@@ mon@@ ly used by school students .
ever in lif@@ etime use of can@@ na@@ bis by 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students may be taken to reflect recent or current use as first experim@@ enting with this sub@@ stance often occur@@ s at or around this age .
data from the 2005 / 06 H@@ B@@ SC survey of 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds showed large vari@@ ation in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use across 27 countries .
European figures can be compared with those from other parts of the world .
pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis use
the fourth round of the " European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs " ( ES@@ PA@@ D ) was conducted in 2007 with the participation of 25 EU M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway .
this survey specifically investig@@ ates sub@@ stance use among school students who turn 16 during the cal@@ end@@ ar year .
results from the latest surveys will be published in December 2008 .
participation in both of these international school surveys , each conducted every four years , has grown in each round and now includes most European countries .
Spain , Italy , Portugal , Slovakia , Sweden and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom also reported data on can@@ na@@ bis use from their own national school surveys in 2006 .
esti@@ m@@ ating intensive and long @@@ -@@ @ term pat@@ ter@@ ns of use is an important public health issue . daily or almost daily use ( use on 20 days or more in the last 30 days ) may be an indicator of intensive use .

the study year ran@@ ges from 2001 to 2007 .
the average pre@@ val@@ ence for Europe was compu@@ ted by a weigh@@ ted average according to the population of the relevant age group in each country .
in countries for which no information was available , the average EU pre@@ val@@ ence was imp@@ uted .
populations used as basis : 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ( 3@@ 28 million ) , 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 ( 13@@ 4 million ) and 15 @@@ -@@ @ 24 ( 64 million ) .

chapter 3 : can@@ na@@ bis representing approximately 2 @@@ -@@ @ 2.5 % of all Europeans in
pat@@ ter@@ ns of can@@ na@@ bis use among school students
H@@ B@@ SC data show that frequent can@@ na@@ bis use remains rare among 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school@@ children .
this issue is highlighted in the 2008 selected issue on vulnerable groups .
the comparison shows that , on average , students who have used can@@ na@@ bis are more likely to have used other substan@@ ces .
although among can@@ na@@ bis users the last month pre@@ val@@ ence of other drug use remained low ( below 10 % ) , levels of cigarette smoking and bin@@ ge drinking among can@@ na@@ bis users was about double that ( 80 % ) found among the general student population .
nevertheless , due to the relatively larger pro@@ portion of the population using can@@ na@@ bis regularly , the overall impact of intensive forms of can@@ na@@ bis use on public health may be significant .
in an Australian study , 92 % of long @@@ -@@ @ term can@@ na@@ bis users were classified as having been dependent at some point in their life , with more than half of them jud@@ ged to be dependent at the time of the study .
a follow @@@ -@@ @ up study carried out one year later suggested that , among long @@@ -@@ @ term users , measures of can@@ na@@ bis use and dependence may be stable for this length of time ( S@@ wi@@ ft et al . , 2000 ) .
only Sweden and Norway report a series of surveys of young people or cons@@ cripts dating back to the 197@@ 0s .
a first wave of use was observed in the 197@@ 0s , followed by a decline in the 1980s and a new substantial increase during the 1990s .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is developing , in collaboration with several countries , methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long @@@ -@@ @ term forms of can@@ na@@ bis use , including dependence .
this information may assist EU M@@ ember

annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe school students .
a comparison of H@@ B@@ SC data of 2001 / 02 and 2005 / 06 shows a stable or decreas@@ ing trend in both lif@@ etime and other more frequent can@@ na@@ bis use among 15 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students in most EU countries ( 49 ) .
other recent national school surveys conducted in Spain , Portugal , Slovakia , Sweden and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom also report stable or decreas@@ ing trends .
mark@@ edly during the 1990s , in particular among young people ( F@@ ig@@ ure 4 ) and school students .
as can@@ na@@ bis avail@@ ability in Europe as a whole does not seem to have changed and prices seem to be decreas@@ ing in most countries providing information , an explanation for the current stabilisation or decrease has to be found elsewhere .
the 2005 French population survey Bar@@ om@@ è@@ tre san@@ te noted that among those who had stopped using can@@ na@@ bis , 80 % cited a lack of interest as the reason for qu@@ it@@ ting .

decreas@@ es in experim@@ ental or occasi@@ onal use of can@@ na@@ bis are not necessarily directly related to trends in the regular use of the drug .
among the approximately 160 000 new demands for drug treatment ( data available from 24 countries ) reported in 2006 , can@@ na@@ bis clients represent the second largest group ( 28 % ) , after heroin clients ( 34 % ) .
in France , Hungary and the Netherlands (
client pro@@ files in Denmark , Germany , France and Hungary ( 52 ) . those vari@@ ations may be explained by differences in pre@@ val@@ ence of intensive can@@ na@@ bis use , drug treatment organisation or refer@@ r@@ al practices .
see F@@ ig@@ ure T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 2 ( part II ) in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
see T@@ able T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 5 ( part II ) in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
overall , primary can@@ na@@ bis users entering treatment can be divided in to three groups , in terms of frequ@@ ency of use : those who use it occasi@@ onally ( 30 % ) , those using it once to several times a week ( 30 % ) and those using it daily ( 40 % ) ( 57 ) .
however , considerable differences are observed between countries , particularly in the pro@@ portion of regular can@@ na@@ bis users entering treatment .
in Denmark , special funds have recently been allocated for the development of targeted programmes for young can@@ na@@ bis users .
in addition , Belgium , Germany , France , the Netherlands and Switzerland are collabor@@ ating in an international study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive family @@@ -@@ @ based treatment for problematic can@@ na@@ bis use ( In@@ can@@ t ) ( 58 ) .
this finding suggests that many can@@ na@@ bis users are treated within the same sett@@ ings as the users of other drugs , which may present difficulties , both to treatment staff and to clients .
these Inter@@ net@@ based services are targeted at young people and focus on problems related to alcohol and can@@ na@@ bis .
of the specialist services surveyed , most offered short courses of treatment for can@@ na@@ bis use of usually less than 20 sessions .
treatment generally took the form of individual coun@@ selling and ther@@ ap@@ y or coun@@ selling about the possible implications of can@@ na@@ bis use .
some agencies reported can@@ na@@ bis de@@ to@@ x@@ ification , family ther@@ ap@@ y , ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic community and mutual help groups as possible components of treatment .
use of residential care for can@@ na@@ bis treatment when provided was generally in the context of soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ behavi@@ our@@ al problems res@@ p@@ ite .
although most studies on the e@@ ffic@@ acy of can@@ na@@ bis treatment have been carried out in the United States and Australia , European studies are now beginning to be launched or reported .
chapter 3 : can@@ na@@ bis further development of drug use and re @@@ -@@ @ off@@ ending , and may include family , school or psychological coun@@ selling .
Germany , Spain ( Cat@@ alon@@ ia ) , Luxembourg and Austria have implemented protocols and programmes for young people breaking drug laws or who have been convicted for the use or possession of drugs , mostly can@@ na@@ bis .
the offen@@ der may be given the choice of completing a course , instead of paying a fine .

an evaluation of the similar youth off@@ ending teams ( Y@@ O@@ T ) in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom found that this approach had considerable potential benefits ( Mat@@ ri@@ x Research , 2007 ) .
smoking bans and can@@ na@@ bis regulatory tobacco policies could favour@@ ably influence perceived norms , which are predic@@ tors for both tobacco and can@@ na@@ bis use .
the possible links between tobacco policies and can@@ na@@ bis smoking is an issue mer@@ iting attention .
there is also some evidence that can@@ na@@ bis is an economic comple@@ ment ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . responding in the same direction to price and avail@@ ability ) to cigarettes ( Cameron and William@@ s , 2001 ) .
isolated studies found that higher cigarette taxes appear to decrease the inten@@ s@@ ity of mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana use and may have a modest negative effect on the prob@@ ability of use among mal@@ es ( Far@@ re@@ l@@ ly et al . , 2001 ) .
however , in Europe , can@@ na@@ bis use is more pre@@ valent among tobacco smokers than among non @@@ -@@ @ smokers and strong
finally , it is worth noting that the Dutch ban on smoking tobacco in restaurants and bars applies also to coffee shops , and that the city of Am@@ sterdam has decided to ban can@@ na@@ bis smoking in public .
chapter 4 A@@ mp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , ec@@ st@@ asy and L@@ SD
amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine are central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ants .
of the two drugs , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine is by far the more com@@ mon@@ ly available in Europe , whereas significant meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use appears to be restricted to the Cz@@ ech@@ Republic and Slovakia .
g@@ lob@@ ally , after can@@ na@@ bis , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines ( a gener@@ ic term that includes both amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ) and ec@@ st@@ asy are among the most com@@ mon@@ ly consu@@ med illi@@ cit drugs .
moreover , in parts of Europe , use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines constitu@@ tes an important part of the drug problem , accounting for a substantial pro@@ portion of those in need of treatment .
ec@@ st@@ asy ref@@ ers to syn@@ thetic substan@@ ces that are chem@@ ically related to amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , but which differ to some extent in their effects .
the best @@@ -@@ @ known member of the ec@@ st@@ asy group of drugs is 3,4 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ y@@ len@@ edi@@ ox@@ y @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ( M@@ D@@ MA ) , but other anal@@ o@@ gues are also sometimes found in ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets ( M@@ DA , M@@ D@@ EA ) .
ec@@ st@@ asy use was virtually unknown in Europe before the late 1980s , but increased dramatically during the 1990s .
its popularity has histor@@ ically been linked with the dance @@@ -@@ @ music scene and , in general , syn@@ thetic drug use at high pre@@ val@@ ence is associated with particular cultural sub @@@ -@@ @ groups or social sett@@ ings .
however , there appears to be a growing interest among young people in n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic substan@@ ces .
on the illi@@ cit drugs market , the main representatives of the amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines group are amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ( and their sal@@ ts ) - two closely related syn@@ thetic substan@@ ces , members of the ph@@ en@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ine family .
both substan@@ ces are central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ants , sharing the same mechanism of action , and having similar behavi@@ our@@ al effects , tolerance , withdrawal and prol@@ on@@ ged ( chron@@ ic ) use effects .
amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine is less po@@ tent than meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , but in un@@ controlled situations the effects are almost in@@ distingu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble .
amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine products mostly cons@@ ist of pow@@ ders , but " ice , " the p@@ ure cr@@ y@@ stal@@ line hydro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide salt of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine is also used .
tab@@ lets containing either amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine may carry log@@ os similar to those seen on M@@ D@@ MA and other ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets .
given the physical forms in which they are available , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine may be ing@@ ested , s@@ nor@@ ted , in@@ hal@@ ed and , less com@@ mon@@ ly , in@@ j@@ ected .
unlike the sul@@ ph@@ ate salt of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine hydro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide , particularly the cr@@ y@@ stal@@ line form ( " ice " ) , is sufficiently vola@@ tile to be sm@@ oked .
for information on the sources of data for drug supply and avail@@ ability , see p@@ .@@ 3@@ 6.
Meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine major producer and consumer of this drug ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; UNODC , 2008 ) .
most amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine seized in Europe is produced , in order of importance , in the Netherlands , Poland and Belgium , and to a les@@ ser extent in Estonia and Lithuania .
international action against the manufac@@ ture and di@@ version of syn@@ thetic drug prec@@ ur@@ sors
Turkey reported seiz@@ ures of about 20 million amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine tab@@ lets with the lo@@ go " Cap@@ tag@@ on . "
production of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine in this form is reported in both Bulgaria and Turkey , and is thought to be largely intended for expor@@ tation to consumer countries in the Ne@@ ar and Middle East .
project Pr@@ ism is an international initiatives et up to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als used in the illi@@ cit manufac@@ ture of syn@@ thetic drugs , through a system of pre@@ export noti@@ fic@@ ations for li@@ cit trade and the reporting of ship@@ ments stopped and seiz@@ ures made when suspicious transactions occur .
in Europe , an estimated 38 000 seiz@@ ures amounting to 6.@@ 2 tonnes of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine pow@@ der were made in 2006 .
however , this conclusion is provisional as the most recent data from the United Kingdom , the country in Europe which typically reports the most seiz@@ ures , are not yet available .
g@@ lob@@ ally , reports suggest that over 11 tonnes of ep@@ h@@ edr@@ ine and p@@ se@@ u@@ do @@@ -@@ @ ep@@ h@@ edr@@ ine , key prec@@ ur@@ sors of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , were seized in 2006 .
the p@@ urity of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine samples inter@@ cep@@ ted in Europe in 2006 var@@ ied considerably and to such an extent that any comment on typical values must be made with caution .
nevertheless , countries reporting data for 2006 can be divided in to two groups , with 10 countries reporting values of between 2 % and 10 % and the others reporting higher p@@ urity levels ( 25 @@@ -@@ @ 47 % ) .
this latter group typically included those countries known for having greater involvement with the production , trafficking or consumption of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ( Netherlands , Poland , Bal@@ tic and Nordic countries ) .
over the past five years , the p@@ urity of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has been stable or falling in most of those 19 countries where sufficient data are available to allow an analysis .
seiz@@ ures of saf@@ role , which may replace 3,4 @@@ -@@ @ M@@ DP @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ P in the syn@@ th@@ es@@ is of M@@ D@@ MA , remained margin@@ al in 2006 , with 62 lit@@ res seized worldwide , mostly in Australia ; in Europe , only France reported a seiz@@ ure of saf@@ role ( 7 lit@@ res ) .
in 2006 , the typical retail price of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine var@@ ied between EU@@ R 10 and EU@@ R 15 a gram in half of the reporting countries .
over the period 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , with the exception of the Czech Republic , Spain and Romania , the retail price of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine was reported to have fallen in all 16 countries reporting sufficient data for analysis .
the data on European drug seiz@@ ures mentioned in this chapter can be found in T@@ ables S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 11 to S@@ Z@@ R @@@ -@@ @ 18 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
note that where data for 2006 are ab@@ sent , the correspon@@ ding data for 2005 are used to estimate European tot@@ als .
in Latvia and Malta , most tab@@ lets analy@@ sed did not contain any controlled sub@@ stance .
illi@@ cit production of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine does occur in Europe , though it is largely limited to the Czech Republic , where over 400 small @@@ -@@ @ scale " kit@@ chen laborat@@ ories " were detec@@ ted in 2006 .
the drug is also reported to be produced in Slovakia and , to a les@@ ser extent , Lithuania ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 8@@ a ) .
about 3 000 seiz@@ ures of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine amounting to 15@@ 4 kg of the drug were reported in 17 European countries in 2006 .
Norway accounts for most seiz@@ ures and amounts recovered , followed by Sweden , the Cz@@ ech@@ Republic and Slovakia .
in the latter two countries , seiz@@ ures ten@@ ded to be small , usually of a few gram@@ s or less .
between 2001 and 2006 , both the number and the quanti@@ ty of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine seized in Europe have been increasing ; though still remaining low in comparison to other drugs .
in 2006 , the limited data available suggest that the typical p@@ urity of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine fell somewhere between 20 % and 55 % .
most countries reported that the typical M@@ D@@ MA content of ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets was somewhere between 25 and 65 M@@ G - although there was considerable vari@@ ation in the samples analy@@ sed ( 9 @@@ -@@ @ 90 M@@ G ) .
no clear medium @@@ -@@ @ term trend is ob@@ serv@@ able in the M@@ D@@ MA content of ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets .
it is clear , however , that in comparison to when the drug first became widely available in Europe in the early 1990s , ec@@ st@@ asy has become considerably cheaper .
global ec@@ st@@ asy production is reported by the UNODC ( 200@@ 7@@ a ) to have fallen to around 1@@ 02 tonnes in 2006 .
production appears to have become more geo@@ graph@@ ically di@@ ff@@ use , with manufac@@ ture for local consumption now more common in North America and east and south @@@ -@@ @ east Asia .
L@@ SD use and trafficking is still considered margin@@ al , although seiz@@ ures in Europe are possibly sugges@@ tive of a revi@@ val in interest in the drug in the last few years .
after a long @@@ -@@ @ term down@@ ward trend dating back to the 1990s , both the number and the quanti@@ ty of seiz@@ ures have been increasing since 2003 .
L@@ SD retail prices ( ad@@ jus@@ ted for inflation ) have been slightly declining since 2001 , and ran@@ ged in 2006 between EU@@ R 5 and EU@@ R 11 per unit in most European countries .
pre@@ val@@ ence and pat@@ ter@@ ns of use
the relative importance of Europe as both a consumer and producer of ec@@ st@@ asy can be seen from the data on drug seiz@@ ures .
Europe reported over 20 000 seiz@@ ures resulting in the inter@@ cep@@ tion of nearly 14 million ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets in 2006 .
the Netherlands accounted for the largest quanti@@ ty of ec@@ st@@ asy seized ( 4.@@ 1 million tab@@ lets ) , followed by the United Kingdom , Turkey , France and Germany .
overall , the number of ec@@ st@@ asy seiz@@ ures has decreased over the period 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , and the quanti@@ ty seized has also declined , after a peak year in 2002 ( 64 ) .
in contrast , overall , consumption levels of syn@@ thetic hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drugs such as ly@@ ser@@ gic ac@@ id di@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ide ( L@@ SD ) are lower and have been largely stable for a considerable period .
higher pre@@ val@@ ence levels in some countries need to be understood in the context of , in simple terms at least , two distinc@@ t consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns . in a limited number of
this picture is preliminary as data for the United Kingdom , the country reporting the most seiz@@ ures in 2005 , are not yet available for 2006 .
the European sti@@ mul@@ ant market : " cocaine countries " and " amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines countries " ?
in some countries , cocaine appears to be the dominant sti@@ mul@@ ant drug , while in others , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine appear more com@@ mon@@ ly used . the picture that emer@@ ges from combin@@ ing
Sti@@ mul@@ ant markets in Europe : the relative pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine or amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines in seiz@@ ures and population surveys , and the pro@@ portion of drug users in treatment reporting these substan@@ ces as primary drugs
countries , the use , often by in@@ j@@ ection , of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine accounts for a substantial pro@@ portion of the overall number of problem drug users and those seeking help for drug problems .
data from treatment clients also suggests that those being treated for problems caused by sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs tend to be experiencing problems with only one class of sti@@ mul@@ ants .
moreover , reports from some countries suggest that one sti@@ mul@@ ant can sometimes dis@@ place another on the drugs market .
on average , 3.3 % of all European adults report having used amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines at least once .
use of the drug in the last year is much lower , with a European average of 0.@@ 6 % ( range 0.@@ 0 @@@ -@@ @ 1.3 % ) .
the estimates suggest that around 11 million Europeans have tried amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , and about 2 million have used the drug in the last year ( see T@@ able 3 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .
last year use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines in this age group ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 1 % to 2.9 % , with the majority of countries reporting pre@@ val@@ ence estimates of between 0.@@ 7 % and 1.9 % .
for example , rec@@ re@@ ational and less intensive and damaging pat@@ ter@@ ns of use among socially wel@@ lin@@ tegrated users can co@@ exist with intensive use among more margin@@ alised groups , with greater association with dependence problems and more risk@@ y mo@@ des of administration , such as in@@ j@@ ection and smoking .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA indicator on problem drug use ( P@@ D@@ U ) can be used in a restricted sense for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , where it defin@@ es as such the in@@ j@@ ecting or long dur@@ ation / regular use of the sub@@ stance .
only one M@@ ember State ( Finland ) has provided a recent national estimate of problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use , which in 2005 was estimated to amount to between 1@@ 2000 and 2@@ 2000 problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users ( 4.3 to 7.@@ 9 cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 , aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 54 years ) , about four times the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the country .

the data available for Romania did not permit in@@ ferences to be made for the country as a whole .

in most countries , though not in Sweden and Finland , the pro@@ portion of new clients entering treatment for primary amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use is greater than the pro@@ portion of all clients receiving treatment for this drug .
in contrast to other parts of the world , where the use of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has increased in recent years , levels of its use in Europe appear limited ( Gri@@ ff@@ i@@ ths et al . , 2008 ) .

despite the number of ec@@ st@@ asy users in Europe being similar to that of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , very few are seen by treatment services .
it is estimated that about 9.@@ 5 million European adults have tried ec@@ st@@ asy ( 3 % on average ) and that about 3 million ( 0.@@ 8 % ) have used it in the last year ( see T@@ able 4 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .

rec@@ re@@ ational sett@@ ings
use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and ec@@ st@@ asy in rec@@ re@@ ational sett@@ ings
this approach is particularly relevant to interven@@ tions targeting sett@@ ings where both syn@@ thetic and sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs and alcohol are consu@@ med , such as night bars and clubs .
one of the problems in this area is that the relative roles of illi@@ cit and li@@ cit substan@@ ces may be difficult to distingu@@ ish .
indeed , harmful use of alcohol is associated with one in every four deaths among young men ( aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 29 ) and one in 10 among young women ( 79 ) .
estimates of drug use in these sett@@ ings are typically high , but are not gener@@ alis@@ able to the wider population .
this level of dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was more com@@ mon@@ ly
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe to medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
in most M@@ ember States , limited demand is reflected in the limited avail@@ ability of treatment services specifically targeting users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or ec@@ st@@ asy .
this situation is somewhat different in a few M@@ ember States with long @@@ -@@ @ established chron@@ ic amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine@@ - or meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine @@@ -@@ @ using populations .
in these countries ( princip@@ ally the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Finland , Sweden ) , users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine are treated within specialist services .
treatment options appear to cons@@ ist of de@@ to@@ x@@ ification , followed by individual ther@@ ap@@ y in an out@@ patient setting or group ther@@ ap@@ y in either out@@ patient or residential sett@@ ings .
strategies that address the environment in which young people consum@@ e both drugs and alcohol appear to have considerable potential for safe@@ guar@@ ding public health and
ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic options with robust evidence of effectiveness are generally lacking to guide the treatment of dependence on psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ants , such as amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and cocaine .
as noted in C@@ hap@@ ter 5 , no pharmac@@ ological agents are currently available to help users to manage abst@@ in@@ ence or reduce the cra@@ v@@ ings associated with psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ant dependence .
furthermore , the literature would suggest that no particular psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial intervention has shown strong evidence of effectiveness in helping psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ant users to maintain abst@@ in@@ ence .

chapter 5 cocaine and cr@@ ack cocaine

analysis of the number of laborat@@ ories disman@@ tled suggests that most production remains located in these three countries , although it may also occur in other South American countries , before expor@@ tation to the main consumer markets in North America and Europe .
in some EU M@@ ember States , the demand for treatment for cocaine use has increased substan@@ tially in recent years , and now even exceeds that for op@@ i@@ oid treatment in some countries , cities and regions .
moreover , a substantial pro@@ portion of op@@ i@@ oid users in treatment report cocaine as their secondary drug , which may be contributing to their problems and can complic@@ ate their care .
in many countries , cocaine is also reported in the to@@ x@@ ic@@ ological analysis of a high pro@@ portion of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , generally in combination with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and other substan@@ ces .
cocaine produced in the An@@ de@@ an region is then smuggled to Europe from South American countries ( via Brazil , E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , Venezuela ) .
Spain and Portugal remain the major entry points of cocaine in to Europe , the latter 's role having substan@@ tially increased since 2005 .
both the Netherlands and France are reported to be major transit countries for further cocaine distribution in Europe ( Europol , 200@@ 7@@ b ) .
recent reports of cocaine impor@@ tation via east European countries ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , Russia ) may point to the development of new trafficking routes in this part of Europe .

p@@ urity and price
it is estimated that almost a quarter of the cocaine trafficked to Europe in 2007 was transi@@ ted via this region ( UNODC , 2008 ) .
cocaine is trafficked from west Africa to Europe mainly by sea , with large ship@@ ments transported by fishing vessels to un@@ lo@@ ading sites mainly on the coast of northern Portugal and Galic@@ ia in Spain .
smaller ship@@ ments of cocaine are trafficked by air or over@@ land , increasingly associated with smuggling can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in from north Africa .
the growth of the west African cocaine trafficking route has been attributed to several factors .
pat@@ ter@@ ns of cocaine use can be correspon@@ d@@ ingly di@@ verse , ranging from the occasi@@ onal and rec@@ re@@ ational to the highly comp@@ ul@@ sive and dependent .
the quanti@@ ty of cocaine seized has also been increasing over the last decade , but with regular f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ations .
in 2006 , cocaine seiz@@ ures in Europe increased to 72 700 cases and the quanti@@ ty recovered to 121 tonnes ( 84 ) .
Spain continued to be the country reporting the highest seiz@@ ures , accounting for 58 % of all seiz@@ ures and 41 % of the quanti@@ ty inter@@ cep@@ ted in Europe that year . the huge increase in the

esti@@ m@@ ating cocaine use by analy@@ sing commun@@ al was@@ te@@ water
it is estimated that around 4 million Europeans have used the drug in the last year ( 1.2 % on average ) , although again national vari@@ ation between countries is considerable .
the application of recent developments in analy@@ tical chem@@ istry to the detection of cocaine in was@@ te@@ water has introduced a new approach to the monitoring of illi@@ cit drug use in the community , known as " se@@ wage ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology . "
the method involves measuring the levels of break@@ down products of illi@@ cit drugs ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine of consumers .
the levels of break@@ down products meas@@ ured in was@@ te@@ water are then scal@@ ed up to calc@@ ulate consumption of illi@@ cit drugs among the population .
in the case of cocaine , the main met@@ abol@@ ite ex@@ cre@@ ted in the ur@@ ine is benz@@ oy@@ lec@@ g@@ on@@ ine .
cocaine use is mainly concentrated among young adults ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 years ) .
se@@ wage ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ology is still in an early stage of development and , as well as important technical and ethical questions , the information it offers must be integrated in to current research thinking .
these issues are addressed in the new E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA publication on was@@ te@@ water analysis ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ b ) .
the approach could also have potential as a drug surveillance tool to assist public health and law enforcement officials in identi@@ fying pat@@ ter@@ ns of drug use across municipalities of var@@ ying siz@@ es .

problem cocaine use and treatment demand
Studies conducted in rec@@ re@@ ational sett@@ ings often report a high pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use .
higher pre@@ val@@ ence levels were also reported in a 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 05 French survey of 14@@ 96 individuals inter@@ viewed in five different electronic music sett@@ ings .
nearly 35 % of the samp@@ le had used cocaine and 6 % cr@@ ack or fre@@ e@@ base cocaine during the last month .
national estimates of problem cocaine use ( in@@ j@@ ection or long dur@@ ation / regular use ) are available only for Spain and Italy , and regional estimates are available for the United Kingdom .
similarly , in Italy , in 2006 , there were estimated to be between 3.@@ 7 and 4.5 problem cocaine users per 1 000 adults .
information for the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom is not directly compar@@ able to that of Spain and Italy , as it is based on cr@@ ack cocaine use .
in 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 05 , one study estimated the number of problem cr@@ ack cocaine users in England at 5.@@ 7 to 6.@@ 4 per 1 000 ad@@ ult population .
among school students , overall pre@@ val@@ ence levels for cocaine use are much lower than those for can@@ na@@ bis use .
ever in lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use among 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students is 2 % or lower in most countries , rising to 4 % in Spain and 5 % in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 89
countries ( 91 ) .
cocaine was also reported as a secondary drug by around 18 % of all drug out@@ patient clients ( 92 ) .
elsewhere in Europe , cocaine accounts for between 5 % and 10 % of all treatment demands ( 10 countries ) or less than 5 % ( 12 countries ) ( 93 ) .

overall the estimated lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of cocaine use is lower among young adults in the European Union than among their counterparts in Australia , Canada and the U@@ SA .
however , at the national level Denmark , Ireland , Spain , Italy and the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( England and Wal@@ es ) report higher figures than Australia .
the increasing trend in demand for cocaine treatment noted in previous years also appears to be continuing , even if it is dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately influenced by a few countries .
the largest increases were reported by Italy and Spain ( 95 ) .
see F@@ ig@@ ures T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 1 and T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 3 and T@@ able T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 3 ( part II ) in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .
cocaine clients entering out@@ patient treatment have the highest male to female rati@@ o among drug treatment clients ( five men for every woman ) .
as a result , some cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related problems will go unidentified , and those suffering them may not receive appropriate care .
most cocaine clients report having started using the drug between the ages of 15 and 24 years ( 99
health problems associated with pow@@ der cocaine , however , are more likely to go un@@ recognised and may affect users who might not norm@@ ally consider themselves at risk .
these problems can be ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated by existing conditions ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . vas@@ cular mal@@ form@@ ations ) and risk factors such as smoking or alcohol use .
many of the deaths attributed to cocaine are produced through these path@@ olo@@ gies .
the first of these are typically more socially integrated , reporting stable housing and employment status , and generally report s@@ nor@@ ting the drug .
the second is a more margin@@ alised group of clients who are typically smoking or in@@ j@@ ecting cocaine ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) , and more often report using either cr@@ ack cocaine or the combination of cocaine and heroin .
in 2006 , around 8 000 cr@@ ack cocaine clients ( about 2 % of all drug clients ) were reported to have entered drug treatment in 20 European countries , although most of them were reported by the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom ( 1@@ 02 ) .
there have been few studies to assess the overall public health impact of cocaine use .
frequent users had a seven times higher risk of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ c@@ tions than non@@ users ( Qu@@ res@@ hi et al . , 2001 ) .
however , it is not possible to general@@ ise directly from this study to Europe .
currently , our understanding of the possible health impact of increasing cocaine use in Europe remains poorly developed and an important area for future public health inquiry .

following the increase of cocaine use and associated problems in several M@@ ember States , specialised drug treatment facilities face the difficult task of adap@@ ting their traditionally op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ oriented services to the var@@ ied cocaine and cr@@ ack @@@ -@@ @ using populations .
however , with the exception of Spain , in 2006 , M@@ ember States assessed the avail@@ ability and acces@@ sibility of cocaine @@@ -@@ @ specific treatment programmes as low .
unlike op@@ i@@ oid dependence , no effective pharmac@@ ological treatment options are currently available to help cocaine users maintain abst@@ in@@ ence or reduce use ( see the 2007 selected issue on cocaine ) .
experim@@ ental ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic drugs to reduce cocaine consumption and cra@@ v@@ ings have shown potential in clin@@ ical trials ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . bac@@ lo@@ f@@ en , ti@@ ag@@ ab@@ ine , top@@ ir@@ am@@ ate ) .
Mo@@ da@@ fin@@ il , a central ner@@ v@@ ous system sti@@ mul@@ ant , has shown particularly promising results as a psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ant sub@@ stitution drug with the advantage that , compared to other potential sub@@ stitute drugs ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . d @@@ -@@ @ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ) , its abuse li@@ ability is low ( My@@ ri@@ ck et al . , 2004 ) .
of the M@@ ember States that report high pre@@ val@@ ence levels of cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine , several have been particularly active in responding to this problem .
in 2007 , Spain introduced a specific national action plan on cocaine , while Ireland implemented and evalu@@ ated a number of specific programmes aimed at different groups of cocaine users .
these programmes target problematic in@@ tran@@ as@@ al cocaine users , pol@@ y@@ drug users with cocaine problems , as well as women and sex workers using cocaine .
in Italy , a lar@@ ges@@ cal@@ e clin@@ ical trial will be carried out in 2008 to investigate the effectiveness of two pharmac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als ( ar@@ ip@@ ip@@ raz@@ ole and ro@@ pin@@ ir@@ ole ) for the treatment of cocaine dependence .
by re@@ war@@ ding abst@@ in@@ ence , contin@@ gency management ( cm ) aims to reduce the rein@@ forcing effects of drugs .
for example , the incentive could be v@@ ou@@ chers of small monetary value , which increase with each successive period of abst@@ in@@ ence . in this scenario , failure to stay dru@@ g@@ free results in the loss of the acc@@ um@@ ulated gains .
this techni@@ que repeatedly rein@@ forces the dru@@ g@@ free behaviour of the client and provides a regular goal to be achieved .
information on the nature of the services provided to problem cocaine users in Europe is scar@@ ce .
according to a recent Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom report ( nice , 2007 ) , cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related problems in British specialised treatment centres appear to be only addressed when the primary drug problem is related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
adequate investment , appropriate treatment protocols and specialised training needs are , therefore , likely to be key issues for service development in this area .
Im@@ mun@@ other@@ ap@@ y for cocaine dependence through a cocaine vacc@@ ine ( T@@ a @@@ -@@ @ CD ) is also under investigation .
once administered , the vacc@@ ine indu@@ ces the production of anti@@ bodies that bin@@ d to cocaine mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les in the blo@@ od@@ stream and , there@@ by , allow n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing en@@ z@@ y@@ mes to conver@@ t them in to in@@ active mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les .
the results of the initial clin@@ ical trials are encouraging , though further studies are required to test the vi@@ ability of the vacc@@ ine as a pharmac@@ other@@ ap@@ y for cocaine dependence .
a qual@@ it@@ ative study in six Spanish cities showed that the main substan@@ ces used among sex workers were alcohol and cocaine .
drug use was reported as occasi@@ onal and instr@@ um@@ ental in helping to reduce psychological barriers or in@@ hibition , and increase tolerance to long hours of sex work with different clients .
among the consequences of drug use in pro@@ stitu@@ tes were un@@ protected sex and a higher risk of violence by clients .
severe cr@@ ack cocaine consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns are also often observed in this group .
the effectiveness of such an approach is uncertain and raises ethical concerns , which are discussed in dep@@ th in the forthcoming E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA publication Ad@@ diction ne@@ ur@@ o@@ bi@@ ology : ethical and social implications .
sex workers with cocaine and cr@@ ack cocaine problems are targeted by out@@ reach and harm@@ reduction services .
problem cocaine use is frequently associated with severe physical and mental health consequences .
as reported in C@@ hap@@ ter 4 , M@@ ember States are increasingly adopting an integrated approach towards reducing harm related to the use of alcohol and illi@@ cit drugs in rec@@ re@@ ational sett@@ ings .

however , large seiz@@ ures of mor@@ ph@@ ine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; UNODC , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .
global seiz@@ ures of ac@@ etic an@@ hy@@ dri@@ de ( used in the illi@@ cit manufac@@ ture of heroin ) increased to 26 400 lit@@ res in 2006 , most of it recovered in the Russian Federation ( 99 00 lit@@ res ) and Col@@ om@@ bia ( 8 800 lit@@ res ) , followed by Turkey ( 3 800 lit@@ res ) ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 8@@ b ) .

Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points .
moreover , as most studies are based on a lo@@ cal@@ ised geographical area , such as a city or district , extra@@ po@@ lation to the national level is often difficult .
for example , in some countries where problem op@@ i@@ oid use has histor@@ ically pre@@ dominated , recent reports suggest that other drugs including cocaine are growing in importance .
estimates of the pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use at national level during the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 06 range roughly between one and six cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ;
from the relatively limited data available , an estimated average pre@@ val@@ ence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use of between four and five cas@@ es@@ per@@ 1000 of the population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 can be der@@ ived .
assuming this reflects the EU as a whole , it imp@@ lies some 1.5 million ( 1.3 million to 1.7 million ) problem op@@ i@@ oid users in the EU and Norway in 2006 .
trends and inci@@ dence of problem op@@ i@@ oid use
O@@ pi@@ oid indicators are no longer decreas@@ ing
in contrast to trends described in previous annual reports , recent data show some increases in dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths , heroin seiz@@ ures and new treatment demands for heroin in the European Union .
in 2003 , the down@@ ward trend in the number of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths reported in Europe , mostly related to the use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , ce@@ ased and between 2003 and 2005 most M@@ ember States have been reporting an up@@ ward trend .
numbers of seiz@@ ures of heroin increased by over 10 % in 16 out of 24 reporting countries between 2003 and 2006 .
after falling for several years , new demands for treatment with heroin as the primary drug have increased in about half of the countries reporting data between 2005 and 2006 .
this may reflect a change in inci@@ dence of heroin use beginning a few years earlier , because of the natural time la@@ g between initi@@ ation of use and first treatment .
this is an important issue for further investigation as available data do not allow a clear picture to be drawn .
treatment found that primary op@@ i@@ oid users accounted overall for 59 % of clients but only for 40 % of clients entering treatment for the first time in their lives ( 110 ) .
furthermore , these models can provide only a partial estimate of inci@@ dence , as they are based on only those cases that come in to contact with treatment .
only two countries report recent data , showing different trends .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , in collaboration with a group of national experts , has recently developed new guidelines for inci@@ dence esti@@ mation , in order to encourage further work in this area ( S@@ cal@@ ia Tom@@ ba et al . , 2008 ) .
most drug clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use also use other drugs , including cocaine ( 25 % ) , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 23 % ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 18 % ) .
of the 3@@ 87 000 treatment requests reported in 2006 ( data available from 24 countries ) , heroin was recorded as the principal drug in 47 % of cases for which the primary drug is known .
in most countries , between 50 % and 80 % of all treatment demands are reported to be related to op@@ i@@ oid use ; in the remaining countries the pro@@ portion var@@ ies between 15 % and 40 % ( 109 ) .
O@@ pi@@ o@@ ids are not only the most frequently reported primary drug among those entering treatment but even more so among those who are already in treatment .
a recent project involving nine countries and focusing on all clients in
B@@ up@@ ren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine misuse is reported as the main reason for entering treatment by 40 % of all clients in Finland and 8 % of clients in France .
in Latvia and Sweden , between 5 % and 8 % of drug clients report primary use of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids other than heroin or meth@@ ad@@ one : mainly bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine , pain@@ kil@@ lers and other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ( 112 ) .

improving the level of information available on this special population is , therefore , an important challenge for the development of health monitoring systems in Europe .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
for Estonia , the up@@ per limit of the uncertainty inter@@ val is off @@@ -@@ @ scale ( 3@@ 7.@@ 9 per 1 000 ) .

changes in the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among heroin users entering treatment may indicate trends in the wider group of problem op@@ i@@ oid users .

that among clients already in treatment the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors at treatment entrance was relatively high .
many countries conduct regularly repeated studies on groups of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , usually in the context of inf@@ ec@@ tious disease testing , that are often recru@@ ited from a variety of sett@@ ings in order to maxim@@ ise gener@@ alis@@ ability .
compar@@ is@@ ons between countries should be made with caution due to potential bi@@ ases in selec@@ tive recru@@ it@@ ment to these studies ( 1@@ 17 ) .
the var@@ ying levels of new in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors in these countries , where information is available , may reflect differences in the average age of initi@@ ation as well as increasing in@@ j@@ ecting inci@@ dence among the younger or the older populations .

a simple comparison of the estimates of the number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users and the reported number of treat@@ ments delivered suggests that more than one in three could be receiving sub@@ stitution treatment .
O@@ pi@@ oid users report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) , and in some countries a higher frequ@@ ency of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bid psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders is noted .

re@@ views of r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials and ob@@ serv@@ ational studies conclude that meth@@ ad@@ one maintenance treatment ( M@@ M@@ T ) and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine maintenance treatment ( BM@@ T ) can both be effective for the management of op@@ i@@ oid dependence .
a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review concluded , however , that bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine is less effective than meth@@ ad@@ one delivered at adequate dos@@ es ( Mat@@ tic@@ k et al . , 2008 ) .

Dru@@ g@@ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases
inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases such as HIV and hep@@ ati@@ tis B and C@@ are among the most serious health consequences of drug use .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is system@@ atically monitoring HIV and hep@@ ati@@ tis B and C among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users ( pre@@ val@@ ence of anti@@ bodies , or other specific mar@@ kers in the case of hep@@ ati@@ tis B ) .
the data have to be interpreted with caution , given several meth@@ od@@ ological limit@@ ations in the different data systems ( 125 ) .
between 2001 and 2006 , no strong increases have been observed in any country in the population rate of HIV infection .
where some slight increase is observed ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Bulgaria , Ireland ) , this remained below one additional case per million population per year .
by the end of 2006 , the inci@@ dence of diagnos@@ ed HIV infection among in@@ j@@ ecting drug users ( I@@ D@@ U@@ s ) appears to have been low in most countries of the European Union , and the overall EU situation appears relatively positive in a global context .
in Bulgaria , the low rate of increase has accelerated recently , with 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 13 and 34 new cases per year between 2001 and 2006 , suggesting the potential for an outbreak .
trends in HIV infection
data on newly diagnos@@ ed cases related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use for 2006 suggest that infection rates are still falling overall in the European Union , following the peak in 2001 @@@ -@@ @ 02 , which was due to out@@ breaks in Estonia , countries , HIV pre@@ val@@ ence remained unchanged during the period .

although in two of these , regional increases were also reported : in Bulgaria , one city , Sofia ; and in Italy , eight out of 21 regions and one city .
the high annual rate of new HIV diagnos@@ es related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use in Estonia , Latvia and Portugal suggests that transmission is still oc@@ curr@@ ing in these countries at high levels .
the comparison of trends in newly diagnos@@ ed inf@@ ections related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use with trends in HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among I@@ D@@ U@@ s suggests that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection related to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is declining in most countries at national level .

annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the most recent data indicate that the inci@@ dence of HIV infection among I@@ D@@ U@@ s is generally low in the European Union .
however , vig@@ il@@ ance is needed as some M@@ ember States continue to show high rates of new HIV inf@@ ections linked to in@@ j@@ ecting drug use , and the situation is even more wor@@ rying in some neighbouring countries .
H@@ C@@ V anti@@ body levels among national samples of I@@ D@@ U@@ s in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 v@@ ary from around 15 % to 90 % , with most countries typically reporting levels in exc@@ ess of 40 % .
in neighbouring countries to the east of the European Union , the situation is of particular concern .
in the two largest countries , Russia and Ukraine , the number of newly diagnos@@ ed cases is high and still increasing .
within countries , H@@ C@@ V pre@@ val@@ ence levels can v@@ ary considerably , reflecting both regional differences and the character@@ isti@@ cs of the samp@@ led population .
for example , in the United Kingdom , local studies report levels between 29 % and 59 % , while in Italy different regional estimates range from around 40 % to 96 % .
while estimates generated from non @@@ -@@ @ prob@@ ability samples must always be taken with caution , the vari@@ ations in pre@@ val@@ ence levels found are likely to have important implications for the targeting and delivery of prevention and treatment programmes .
furthermore , understanding the factors responsible for differ@@ ential levels of infection is likely to inform the development of better intervention strategies .
recent studies ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 ) typically report pre@@ val@@ ence levels of between 20 % and 50 % , although with considerable vari@@ ation between samples .
in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , six of the 11 countries providing data on I@@ D@@ U@@ s reported anti @@@ -@@ @ H@@ B@@ c pre@@ val@@ ence levels of over 40 % ( 13@@ 3 ) .
the pro@@ portion of I@@ D@@ U@@ s among all noti@@ fied cases of hep@@ ati@@ tis B may have declined slightly in some countries , possibly reflecting the increasing impact of vacc@@ ination programmes targeted at I@@ D@@ U@@ s .
in the case of hep@@ ati@@ tis C , the pro@@ portion of I@@ D@@ U@@ s among noti@@ fied cases has declined in five countries , but has increased in
access to HIV testing and treatment provision in Europe have increased considerably over the past decade .
as a result many of those who become infected with the virus will not have the advantage of early treatment and care .
they may also contribute to the spread of HIV by un@@ know@@ ingly ex@@ posing others to the risk of infection .
in addition , the quality of the data collected by the HIV surveillance systems is dimin@@ ished .
preliminary data suggest that access to anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and care by I@@ D@@ U@@ s is dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately low ( Don@@ og@@ ho@@ e et al . , 2007 ) .
effective an@@ tiv@@ iral treatment approaches need to take account of the specific situation and needs of I@@ D@@ U@@ s .
to improve the access to HIV testing and treatment , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA has developed specific guidelines for offering annual voluntary medical exam@@ ination to I@@ D@@ U@@ s , including

transmission of hep@@ ati@@ tis B virus ( H@@ B@@ V ) continues among I@@ D@@ U@@ s in Europe , among whom rates of active H@@ B@@ V infection ( pre@@ val@@ ence of H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) remain high in most countries , compared to the general population ( 1 ) .
vacc@@ ination is considered the most effective measure to prevent hep@@ ati@@ tis B virus ( H@@ B@@ V ) infection and its consequences .
in line with the 1991 WHO recommendation , most , but not all EU M@@ ember States have adopted universal vacc@@ ination against this virus .
inf@@ ant vacc@@ ination policies , however , will mostly affect future generations of drug users .
to reduce the spread of the infection sooner , over half the EU M@@ ember States have adopted vacc@@ ination programmes specifically targeting in@@ j@@ ecting drug users and / or prisoners .
nevertheless , coverage of these programmes var@@ ies between countries , and a third of EU M@@ ember States still report no vacc@@ ination programme specifically for drug users .
prisons are important sett@@ ings for interven@@ tions targeting inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases related to drug use and for providing healthcare to a population that is otherwise hard to reach ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
vacc@@ ination programmes targeting drug users often face the problem of low compliance resulting in non @@@ -@@ @ completion of vacc@@ ination courses .
repeated offers of vacc@@ ination and extra dos@@ es for those with decreased im@@ mun@@ e response may also help to achieve higher im@@ mun@@ isation results .
this may require EU M@@ ember States to review and possibly fine @@@ -@@ @ tune their policies in order to decrease the oc@@ curr@@ ence of chron@@ ic H@@ B@@ V infection and its consequences .

during the period 1990 @@@ -@@ @ 2005 , between 6 500 and 8 500 dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths were reported each year by EU M@@ ember States , adding up to about 130 000 deaths .
these figures should be considered as a minimum estimate ( 13@@ 8 ) .
moreover , many dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths are , in fact , pol@@ y@@ drug deaths , and understanding the respective role of different drugs can be difficult .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 16 European countries and over 40 per million in five countries .
among mal@@ es aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 39 years , the mortality rates are , on average and in most countries , twice as high ( aver@@ aging 44 deaths per million in Europe ) .
in 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 06 , dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths accounted for 3.5 % of all deaths among Europeans aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 39 years , and for more than 7 % in eight countries ( 13@@ 9 ) ( F@@ ig@@ ure 11 ) .
the second component is broader and covers deaths which can@@ not be directly attri@@ but@@ able to the pharmac@@ ological action of the drugs , but are nevertheless linked with their use : long @@@ -@@ @ term consequences of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , inter@@ actions with mental health issues ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . suicide ) or with other circumstances ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . road traffic accidents ) .
there are also deaths related to drugs , but due to circum@@ stan@@ tial reasons ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . violence related to the drug trade ) .
there is still limited research on the mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and other consequences of non @@@ -@@ @ fatal over@@ dos@@ es and limited investment in prevention efforts , despite evidence that the numbers may be considerable .

deaths directly caused by pharmac@@ ological over@@ d@@ ose seem to be un@@ common , and these are usually linked with very large cocaine dos@@ es .
otherwise , most cocaine deaths seem to be the result of the chron@@ ic to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity of the drug leading to cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular and ne@@ ur@@ ological complic@@ ations .
the role of cocaine in these deaths may not always be identified , and they may not be reported as cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related .
the dramatic expansion of meth@@ ad@@ one treatment in Europe has not been reflected in a parallel rise of meth@@ ad@@ on@@ er@@ e@@ lated deaths .
this represents a decrease in the meth@@ ad@@ on@@ er@@ e@@ lated death rate from 13 per 1 000 patient years in 1993 to 3.@@ 1 per 1 000 patient years in 2004 .
while similar studies in other countries would be very useful , the available evidence suggests that meth@@ ad@@ on@@ er@@ e@@ lated deaths are more likely to be linked to defic@@ i@@ encies in pres@@ cri@@ bing practices than to overall levels of sub@@ stitution treatment .
most deaths with " presence of ec@@ st@@ asy " are reported in the United Kingdom , but in many cases the drug has not been identified as the direct cause of death .
trends in dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths
Europe had a very high mortality rate compared to pe@@ ers of the same age ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) .
trends in dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths over the period 2001 to 2005 / 06 are more difficult to describe .
a number of factors could be associated with this , including : increases in pol@@ y@@ drug use , a possible growth in the avail@@ ability of heroin or an ag@@ eing population of chron@@ ic drug users ( 15@@ 2
a recent Norwegian study of a co@@ h@@ ort of drug users admitted to drug treatment found that among 18@@ 9 recorded deaths , over@@ dos@@ es , accounted for half of all deaths , where the causes were known .
it should be noted that the pro@@ portion of AIDS deaths can be considerably higher in countries with a high HIV pre@@ val@@ ence among drug users .
in the absence of data from some of the larger countries , overall estimates of the number of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths for 2006 remain provisional .
however , the available data from 18 countries are sugges@@ tive of a small decrease compared to 2005 .
this ob@@ servation requires further investigation , as it could point to increases in the numbers of young people using op@@ i@@ o@@ ids in these countries .
co@@ h@@ ort studies area valuable tool for esti@@ m@@ ating and understanding the overall mortality related to drug use , but other approaches can help improve the understanding of the issue and provide an over@@ view at national level .
in one of these approaches , mortality rates are extra@@ po@@ lated from co@@ h@@ ort studies to local ( Bar@@ g@@ ag@@ li et al . , 2005 ) or national estimates of problem drug users ( C@@ ru@@ ts et al . , 2008 ) .

chapter 7 : Dru@@ g@@ related inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases and dru@@ g@@ related deaths
reducing dru@@ g@@ related deaths
the reduction of dru@@ g@@ related deaths is a goal of most national drug strategies , but few countries have adopted action plans or provided systematic gu@@ idance on measures to be taken .
however , in 2007 , the United Kingdom 's Department of Health issued new guidelines on clin@@ ical management of drug misuse and dependence , setting out specific actions for the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths .
disease
the study was conducted among a co@@ h@@ ort of 10 4@@ 54 heroin users entering public treatment services from 1998 to 2001 , and evalu@@ ated re@@ tention in treatment and over@@ d@@ ose mortality .
the data are from a study based on a samp@@ le of 5@@ 01 drug users admitted for treatment for drug addi@@ ction during the period 1981 @@@ -@@ @ 91 .
a total of 18@@ 9 deaths were recorded up to 2003 , of which the cause of death could not be identified in 14 cases .
and Euro@@ HIV ( En@@ d @@@ -@@ @ year report for 2005 , 2006 ) , it can be estimated that , in 2003 , over 2 600 people died of
AIDS mortality pe@@ aked in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s and has decreased substan@@ tially following the introduction and increased coverage of H@@ A@@ AR@@ T .
and , in many countries , over@@ d@@ ose mortality is considerably higher
the number of deaths from other causes ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . consequences of other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases , violence , accidents ) is more difficult to assess at present and there is a need to improve data collection and esti@@ mation in this area ( see prec@@ eding section ) .
suicide appears to be a frequent cause of death among drug users .
the year 2003 was taken as the most recent year for which information from almost all M@@ ember States regarding causes of death is available through Eurostat .
for detailed information on sources , numbers and comp@@ ut@@ ations see T@@ able D@@ RD @@@ -@@ @ 5 in the 2008 statistical bul@@ letin .

Cor@@ on@@ ers " records cited the involvement of op@@ i@@ o@@ ids in 95 % of the dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths , benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in 20 % , cocaine in 14 % and tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ pres@@ san@@ ts in 10 % of cases .
of the 4@@ 42 deaths that occurred among the samp@@ le during this period , the majority ( 59 % ) were drug @@@ -@@ @ related .
in the year following release , the dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced mortality rate was 5.2 per 1 000 men and 5.@@ 9 per 1 000 women .
in the period immediately after release , expected rates were exceeded by more than 10 times for women and more than eight times for men .
continuity of care and rehabilitation of drug users that are released from prison are also un@@ developed in many countries .
improvements in these two areas could represent valuable opportunities to prevent dru@@ g@@ related deaths .
chapter 8 New drugs and emerging trends
introduction there was a need to control B@@ Z@@ P , but the control measures should be appropriate to the relatively low risk posed by the sub@@ stance .
in March 2008 , the Council adopted a decision defining B@@ Z@@ P as a new psy@@ cho@@ active sub@@ stance which is to be made subject to control measures and criminal provisions .
in March 2007 , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol reported to the Commission on the active monitoring of 1@@ - ( 3 @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ lor@@ op@@ hen@@ y@@ l ) pi@@ per@@ az@@ ine ( m@@ C@@ P@@ P ) ( 15@@ 9 ) .
the use of new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces can have important public health and policy implications , but monitoring emerging trends is a considerable challenge .
new pat@@ ter@@ ns of drug use are difficult to detec@@ t because , typically , they first emerge at low levels , and in specific lo@@ cal@@ ities or among restricted sub @@@ -@@ @ groups of the population .
few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to this kind of behaviour and the meth@@ od@@ ological difficulties presented by monitoring this kind of drug use are considerable .
EU action on new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces
the Council decision on new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces ( 15@@ 7
during 2007 , a total of 15 new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces were noti@@ fied for the first time through the ear@@ ly@@ warning system to the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol .
the group of newly noti@@ fied substan@@ ces is di@@ verse and , besides new syn@@ thetic drugs , includes medicin@@ al products and n@@ atur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing substan@@ ces .
nine of the newly reported compo@@ unds were syn@@ thetic drugs similar to those listed in sched@@ u@@ les I and II of the 1971 United N@@ ations Convention on psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces .
they included substan@@ ces from known chemical groups such as ph@@ en@@ eth@@ y@@ la@@ mines , try@@ p@@ tam@@ ines and pi@@ per@@ az@@ ines , as well as substan@@ ces with a less common chemical make @@@ -@@ @ up .
the group is equally divided between substan@@ ces that have pronounced hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic effects and those that exhibit predominantly sti@@ mul@@ ant properties .
the risk assessment concluded that due to its sti@@ mul@@ ant properties , risk to health and lack of medical benefits ,
new substan@@ ces under control example on the working methods of online shops ; the way that they respond to users " demands , and new trends among young people .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA conducted a sn@@ ap@@ shot study in early 2008 , which surveyed 25 online shops .
the results of that study a represented here .
online shops
of these substan@@ ces , m@@ C@@ P@@ P had been actively monitored by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and Europol , and B@@ Z@@ P had been the subject of a risk assessment in 2007 .
within the European Union , the majority of online shops identified in the sn@@ ap@@ shot study are based in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom and the Netherlands and , to a les@@ ser extent , Germany and Austria .
online shops based in Europe adverti@@ se over 200 psy@@ cho@@ active products .
the most com@@ mon@@ ly en@@ countered " legal high@@ s " are Sal@@ via di@@ vin@@ orum , kr@@ atom ( Mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ na speci@@ osa ) , Haw@@ ai@@ ian baby wo@@ od@@ rose ( Ar@@ gy@@ re@@ ia ner@@ v@@ osa ) , hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 2006 ) , and a variety of " party pil@@ ls . "
various plants with psy@@ cho@@ active properties are also being controlled .
among the plants placed on the list are k@@ hat ( q@@ at , Cath@@ a ed@@ ul@@ is ) and Sal@@ via di@@ vin@@ orum .
K@@ hat is now controlled by 11 countries in Europe ( a 2005 risk assessment in the Uni@@ ted@@ Kingdom recommended against control ) .
in 2006 , Sweden added sal@@ vin@@ or@@ ine @@@ -@@ @ A , the main active principle of Sal@@ via di@@ vin@@ orum , to its list ; the plant has also been put under control in Germany in 2008 .
in the same period , T@@ ab@@ ern@@ an@@ the i@@ bo@@ ga has been added to the list of controlled substan@@ ces in France , following legal control of the active ing@@ redi@@ ent , i@@ bo@@ ga@@ ine , in Belgium , Denmark and Sweden .
internet study meth@@ od@@ ology
internet - a market@@ place for psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces
to obtain a sn@@ ap@@ shot , Internet sear@@ ches were conducted in January 2008 using multi@@ lin@@ gual key@@ words and the search engine Google ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ go@@ og@@ le@@ .com ) .
a total of 68 EU @@@ -@@ @ based online shops were identified selling various types of " legal high@@ s . "
they were str@@ ati@@ fied according to their country of origin .
EU country code dom@@ ain@@ s ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . ES , F@@ r , de ) or other indic@@ ations of being EU @@@ -@@ @ based ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . contact address ) were used for the identification of the country of origin .
a ran@@ dom samp@@ le of 25 online shops was selected for detailed analysis .
sam@@ pling frac@@ tions in each str@@ at@@ um ( country of origin ) were propor@@ tional to those of the total samp@@ le of online shops .
online shops that sold exclusively to the trade , rather than to the consumer , were excluded as were those that sold only hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms .
the Internet offers a window on the world of the drug us@@ er through online forums and ch@@ at rooms as well as the sites of online shops selling psy@@ cho@@ active alternatives to controlled substan@@ ces .
see " New substan@@ ces under control . "
annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe in the body , and there is currently no read@@ ily available to@@ x@@ ic@@ ological test to determine which of the two substan@@ ces has been consu@@ med .
for example , the average price of a 1 gram d@@ ose of G@@ B@@ L purchased in bul@@ k on the Internet var@@ ies from EU@@ R 0.@@ 09 to EU@@ R 2 .
G@@ H@@ B and its prec@@ ur@@ sor G@@ B@@ L : follow @@@ -@@ @ up
both G@@ H@@ B and G@@ B@@ L have a steep d@@ ose @@@ -@@ @ response cur@@ ve , with rapid on@@ set of symp@@ t@@ oms , which greatly increases the risks associated with illi@@ cit use .
Na@@ us@@ ea , v@@ om@@ iting and various degrees of imp@@ aired con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness are the main adver@@ se affects in most reported cases of G@@ H@@ B in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ation .
however , the frequent presence of other drugs may complic@@ ate the clin@@ ical presentation .
a Dutch study of 72 G@@ H@@ B users reported that the majority had passed out at least once while on G@@ H@@ B and some had done so frequently ( Kor@@ f et al . , 2002 ) .
in a survey of G@@ H@@ B and G@@ B@@ L users in the United Kingdom , adver@@ se reactions were reported to be more common in club sett@@ ings than in private homes ( Sum@@ n@@ all et al . , 2008 ) .
G@@ H@@ B occur@@ s n@@ atur@@ ally in the human body , but is also used as a medicine and as a rec@@ re@@ ational drug .
concerns quickly ar@@ ose about the health risks associated with its use .
in particular , anx@@ i@@ eties ar@@ ose about the potential for sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously adding G@@ H@@ B to drin@@ ks ( com@@ mon@@ ly referred to as " drink sp@@ ik@@ ing " ) to facilitate sexual assault .
however , there is a lack of foren@@ sic evidence for this , and establishing it is difficult due to the narrow time window for detec@@ ting G@@ H@@ B in body f@@ lu@@ ids .
however , the association of G@@ H@@ B with drug @@@ -@@ @ facilit@@ ated sexual assault may have contributed to a relatively " negative image " of the sub@@ stance ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ c ) .
although G@@ H@@ B is associated with only a very small pro@@ portion of all drug in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ation emer@@ gen@@ cies requiring hospital or ambul@@ ance emergency services , numbers appear to have increased since 2000 .
in Am@@ sterdam , in 2005 , the pro@@ portion of requests for emergency assistance that required transportation to hospital was higher for cases related to G@@ H@@ B / G@@ B@@ L than to those involving other drugs .
G@@ B@@ L is rapidly conver@@ ted in to G@@ H@@ B
chapter 8 : new drugs and emerging trends
this suggests that G@@ B@@ L use may be more common than was previously thought ( Wood et al . , 2008 ) .
1,4 @@@ -@@ @ B@@ D ) under drug control or equivalent legislation and discussions about possible further controls are in progress in the United Kingdom .
due to its rapid elimination from the body , it is difficult to establish G@@ H@@ B / G@@ B@@ L as a cause of in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ation or death .
furthermore , there is an absence of an accur@@ ate and compar@@ able system for recor@@ ding the number of deaths and non @@@ -@@ @ fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies related to the use of G@@ H@@ B and its prec@@ ur@@ sors .
interven@@ tions for prevention and harm@@ reduction in response to the use of G@@ H@@ B / G@@ B@@ L are com@@ mon@@ ly provided by national and community drugs projects that target night@@ life sett@@ ings .
these interven@@ tions usually cons@@ ist of training club staff and dis@@ semin@@ ating information about the risks of using G@@ H@@ B and other drugs .
such interven@@ tions often take place in con@@ jun@@ ction with other interven@@ tions related to " club drugs " and use of alcohol and drug combin@@ ations ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ e ) .

annual report 2008 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
the European Monitoring Centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA ) is one of the European Union 's decentral@@ ised agencies .
established in 1993 and based in Lisbon , it is the central source of comprehensive information on drugs and drug addi@@ ction in Europe .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA collec@@ ts , analy@@ ses and dis@@ semin@@ ates fac@@ tual , objective , reliable and compar@@ able information on drugs and drug addi@@ ction .
in doing so , it provides its audiences with an evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based picture of the drug phenomenon at European level .
the Centre 's public@@ ations area prime source of information for a wide range of audiences including policymakers and their advisers ; professionals and researchers working in the field of drugs ; and , more broad@@ ly , the media and general public .
the annual report presents the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's ye@@ arly over@@ view of the drug phenomenon in the EU and is an essential reference book for those seeking the latest findings on drugs in Europe .
all trans@@ lations were made by the Trans@@ lation Centre for the Bo@@ dies of the European Union .

furthermore , we make a commitment that the identification of what constitu@@ tes effective practice in the drugs field will form an increasingly important part of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's future activities .
this report provides a ti@@ mely and detailed assessment of Europe 's drug situation , and we are gra@@ te@@ ful to our staff who have worked so hard to produce it .
as well as making an important contribution to a mature and informed debate on the drug problem , the existence of this monitoring system , we believe , results in better and more effective policies .
such policies are increasingly necessary , as the challenges in this area grow ever more complex .
a common theme running through this report is the dynamic nature of the drug problem , and we need to ensure that our vision keeps pace with the changing conditions with which we are confron@@ ted .
the conference also identified a number of important issues that are echoed in the analysis presented here .
our information systems need to perform better in identi@@ fying , tr@@ acking and reporting on new trends .
in achieving this , however , it is essential that our reporting remains accur@@ ate , gro@@ unded and non @@@ -@@ @ alar@@ mist .
also highlighted was the need to unite in our analysis both supply @@@ -@@ @ side and demand @@@ -@@ @ side issues .
in this year 's report , we give greater pro@@ min@@ ence to an analysis of supply @@@ -@@ @ side indicators and the drug market .
we do this cau@@ ti@@ ously , as insufficient efforts have yet been made to improve the quality , reli@@ ability and compar@@ ability of the European data set in this area .
this is now widely recognised , and we are committed to working with our national and European partners to address this issue .
this year , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA celebrated 15 years of collecting information and reporting on the European drug problem .
to mark this event we held a conference entitled " identi@@ fying Europe 's information needs for effective drug policy . "
finally , it should be noted that the European Union and the United N@@ ations have renewed their drug policy documents almost in parallel in late 2008 and early 2009 .
the new EU action plan on drugs and the new UN political declaration and action plan both reflect the international commitment to reduce drug use and the har@@ ms it can cause .
to achieve these objectives constitu@@ tes a major challenge and will only be achieved if the planned actions are widely implemented .
monitoring and evaluation are key elements in this process , as they allow us to keep our policies on course and char@@ t the progress made .
no@@ where else exists such a large group of cul@@ tur@@ ally different countries who demonstrate a common determination in improving their understanding and responses to this complex social problem .
this can be seen in the development of a trans@@ versal drug monitoring system that en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es 30 countries with a combined population of more than half a billion people .
it can also be seen in the EU drugs strategy and action plan , tools that are designed to take stock of the information available and elabor@@ ate it into practical and collective action .
we are confident that our current report contributes to this process .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA would like to than@@ k the following for their help in producing this report :
• the heads of the Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national fo@@ cal points and their staff ;
• the services within each M@@ ember State that collected the raw data for this report ;

commen@@ tary hit@@ ting a moving target - the challenge of developing a pragm@@ atic policy response to a changing drug problem
policy consensus permits a more targeted drug action plan to be moving closer to the European model .
the reporting mechanism developed to assess the implementation of the UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS action plans has been criticised .
but with its de@@ mis@@ e , important areas of work , particularly those concerning demand reduction measures remain outside of the existing global reporting framework .
this issue is likely to be an important topic for the forthcoming session of the Commission on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs .
law enforcement practice confron@@ ted by competing policy objectives
this report covers an important period for drug policy , both in Europe and beyond .
although attention is often given to the differences that exist between M@@ ember States in their drug policies , from a historical perspective the considerable agreement that is now evident in discussions at European level is striking .
this has per@@ mitted a new EU action plan that can be described as pragm@@ atic , focused and targeted .
this approach is concre@@ tely illu@@ strated in the attention given to specific areas of practice such as the prevention of dru@@ g@@ related deaths , working in prison sett@@ ings and improving the quality of treatment and other interven@@ tions .
the number of violations of drug laws reported in Europe continues to grow .
and although the data are difficult to interpre@@ t , this ob@@ servation raises questions about the extent to which law enforcement practice is in step with policy objectives in this area .
in this debate , Europe has provided a strong voice for drug policies that are balanced , scienti@@ fic@@ ally gro@@ unded and human@@ e .
this has helped to ensure that , in the final agreement , the key pro@@ gressive elements of the original 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS documents were preserved .
the U@@ SA , for example , sof@@ tened its approach to the provision of ster@@ ile in@@ j@@ ecting equipment to reduce the risk of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne inf@@ ections , reflecting the substantial evidence base for effectiveness that now exists in this area .
broad@@ ly speaking , the European policy debate has moved towards the view that priority should be given to inter@@ diction activities targeting the supply rather than the use of drugs .
reflecting this , in some countries the legal penalties applic@@ able to supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences have been raised or minimum tariffs have been introduced .
the extent to which this shift in emphasis away from users and towards drug suppliers is being translated into policing practice is difficult to ga@@ uge .
only in a few countries do offences related to drug supply out@@ number those for drug possession .
overall , the number of supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences has increased ; but the number of offences related to possession or use of drugs has also increased , and to an even greater degree .
as well , across Europe the picture for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences is more mixed , with half of the reporting countries noting a decline in numbers in the medium @@@ -@@ @ term data .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe integrated package of care .
this can be seen , both concep@@ tually and in practice .
for example , harm@@ reduction and treatment interven@@ tions are increasingly linked and offered by the same providers .
the in @@@ -@@ @ dep@@ th review on sent@@ encing for drug law offences in Europe that ac@@ companies this report explo@@ res what happens to those who violate drug laws .
cust@@ odi@@ al sentences are common for supply @@@ -@@ @ related offences , but they tend to be given at the lower end of the available tariffs , aver@@ aging 3 years or less .
this finding has implications for the development of minimum sent@@ encing guidelines , if they are intended to de@@ ter high@@ level career criminals from becoming involved in drug supply .
although progress has been made in tre@@ ating drug users in Europe , it is un@@ even , both in terms of the substan@@ ces addressed and geographical coverage .
the greatest advances have been seen in the area of op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment , with the treated population now in the region of 650 000 and growing .
however , eastern Europe as a whole only contributes to a small pro@@ portion of this total , suggesting that there is a need for an expansion of services in some countries .
a les@@ son that has emerged from a number of countries is that the involvement of general practi@@ tion@@ ers can contribute to an expansion of treatment provision .
shared care arrangements with specialised centres not only provide support to general practi@@ tion@@ ers , but also assure treatment quality .
in most countries , cust@@ odi@@ al sentences are rarely handed out for drug use or possession .
that said , a small percentage of those appe@@ aring in court will get an immediate prison sentence , possibly because of ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating circumstances .
this means that increasing numbers of drug users come into contact with the criminal justice system only to receive an administrative or minor san@@ ction .
some countries have developed innovative approaches in this area , but overall these are still rare .
despite the fact that in most countries it is the@@ ore@@ tically possible to continue or start sub@@ stitution treatment within the prison setting , in practice this is often difficult .
given the number of drug users within prisons in Europe , there is a pressing need to expand treatment opportunities of all types within this setting .
this fact is recognised in the EU action plan , but currently remains a neglec@@ ted area in most countries .
as those charged with drug offences are likely to be a di@@ verse group , needs assessment is a particularly important issue for service development in this area .
developing a wor@@ kable model to ensure appropriate refer@@ r@@ al traj@@ ec@@ tories is likely to pose an organis@@ ational challenge . Portugal has addressed this problem somewhat differ@@ ently .
the use of drugs is no longer subject to criminal sanctions , and those found in possession of drugs are directly referred for needs assessment to a special tribunal , known as a " commission for dis@@ su@@ asion of drug abuse . "
the tribunal can issue fines , but sanc@@ tioning is not its main objective .
for drugs other than op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , the avail@@ ability of services and our understanding of what constitu@@ tes effective care are less well developed in Europe .
in addition , developments in ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence have not only improved our understanding of the biological mechanisms of addi@@ ction , but are now beginning to facilitate some innovative approaches .
examples here include a cocaine vacc@@ ine , now undergoing a large @@@ -@@ @ scale trial in Europe .

the estimates presented here rela@@ te to the ad@@ ult population ( 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years old ) and are based on the most recent data available .
for the complete set of data and information on the meth@@ od@@ ology see the accompan@@ ying statistical bul@@ letin .
lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence : at least 74 million ( 22 % of European adults )
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.@@ 4 % to 14.@@ 6 %
subsequently , the situation began to stabilise , and the most recent data strongly support the analysis presented in last year 's report , of an overall decline in the use of this drug .
pat@@ ter@@ ns found here are likely later to fe@@ ed through into older age co@@ hor@@ ts .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , just as different tempor@@ al pat@@ ter@@ ns could be seen in the up@@ ward trend in can@@ na@@ bis use in the past , this pat@@ tern now appears to be repe@@ ating itself in rever@@ se .
the United Kingdom , for example , one of the first countries to record high pre@@ val@@ ence levels was also one of the ear@@ li@@ est to report a decline in use .
this pat@@ tern is now seen in most other west European countries .
in eastern Europe , levels of use were still increasing in most countries until recently .
however , even in these countries , there are signs of stabilisation in the youth population and , if the pat@@ tern seen elsewhere is repeated , a subsequent decline could be expected .
understanding the factors that influence the popularity of a drug such as can@@ na@@ bis is clearly important .
however , caution should be used in in@@ fer@@ ring any simple ca@@ usal explan@@ ations .
standing out in the European picture is a small group of countries , mainly in the north or south of Europe , where levels of can@@ na@@ bis use have remained low and stable for some time .
last year use : around 2 million or a sixth of lif@@ etime users L@@ ast month use : less than 1 million
country vari@@ ation in last year use : overall range 0.@@ 0 % to 1.3 %
problem op@@ i@@ oid users : estimated at between 1.2 and 1.5 million Europeans
principal drug in more than 50 % of all drug treatment requests
about 650 000 op@@ i@@ oid users received sub@@ stitution treatment in 2007
a c@@ av@@ eat here is that we currently lack good measures of dependent or problem use and , though some progress is being made in this direction , we must rely on more indirect measures .
the number of new can@@ na@@ bis treatment demands may now be stabil@@ ising , after rising steadily for several years .
although to what extent this reflects pat@@ ter@@ ns of use or the capacity of services remains unclear .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA estimates that somewhere between 2 % and 2.5 % of young adults are using can@@ na@@ bis on a daily
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
heroin and cocaine : no strong signs of a dimin@@ ishing problem trend in heroin @@@ -@@ @ related problems is no longer sustained .
and , while there is currently no evidence of a return to the ep@@ i@@ demic spread of heroin use seen in the past , the health and social problems ar@@ ising from the use of this drug are considerable .
any indic@@ ations that the situation may be worsening , especially as Europe enters a period of economic difficulties , are grounds for considerable concern .
Pol@@ y@@ drug use and con@@ com@@ it@@ ant alcohol problems are now the defining elements of the European drug problem
in drug prevention , it has long been understood that sub@@ stance use problems are best addressed hol@@ isti@@ cally and in the context of healthy lif@@ est@@ y@@ les and informed cho@@ ices .
in contrast , the dis@@ course on drug use is more often sub@@ stance specific .
it is hard not to be drawn to the conclusion that this one @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional perspective is becoming increasingly un@@ hel@@ p@@ ful in understanding the developing nature of pat@@ ter@@ ns of sub@@ stance use in Europe .
individuals who use drugs almost never restric@@ t their consumption to a single sub@@ stance .
in Europe today , pol@@ y@@ drug pat@@ ter@@ ns are the nor@@ m , and the combined use of different substan@@ ces is responsible for , or complic@@ ates , most of the problems we face .
and it applies equally to the drug market .
actions to reduce the supply of one drug are clearly dev@@ alu@@ ed if they simply open the door for the use of a sub@@ stitute , which may be even more damaging .
there is little to suggest an improving situation in the use of heroin and cocaine , the two substan@@ ces that remain at the heart of Europe 's drug problem .
in the United Kingdom , a country with a large cocaine market , recent falls in p@@ urity have been considerable .
these data could suggest declining cocaine avail@@ ability , but other information puts this conclusion into question .
however , there is evidence of the further di@@ ff@@ usion of the drug into other countries . treatment demands related to cocaine are also growing .
it will be interesting to see if the future brings more concrete evidence of a decrease in the avail@@ ability of this drug after recent reports of a decline in global cocaine production .
heroin still accounts for the greatest share of mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality related to drug use in Europe .
use of the drug had generally been declining since the mid @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ late 1990s , but today the picture is less clear , and in some areas raises concerns .
following marked decreas@@ es , the number of new treatment demands has been growing since 2002 , with a significant number of countries now reporting increases in both the number and pro@@ portion of treatment demands related to op@@ i@@ oid drugs .
data on dru@@ g@@ related deaths , which are largely associated with heroin use , also provide no indication of a return to the decreas@@ ing trend observed prior to 2004 .
data on the numbers of drug law offences and seiz@@ ures also show increases .
Wor@@ ry@@ ingly , a small number of countries note that heroin problems have been observed among some young people , suggesting that the drug could be di@@ ff@@ using into new populations .
altogether , it must be viewed as dis@@ appointing that the positive analysis of the declining
among the young , multiple sub@@ stance consumption can increase the risks of ac@@ ute problems and is predic@@ tive of developing a chron@@ ic drug ha@@ bit in later life .
among older , regular drug users , pol@@ y@@ drug use is a major issue in drug over@@ d@@ ose , it complic@@ ates drug treatment and is associated with violence and off@@ ending .
the choice of drugs available to consumers in Europe is also growing .
additionally , it has become recognised that a defining factor in Europe 's sub@@ stance use problem is the con@@ com@@ it@@ ant consumption of alcohol .
this too can be seen across every age group .
among school@@ children , the latest data show a strong association between bin@@ ge drinking and drug use . bin@@ ge

innovation and prec@@ ur@@ sor avail@@ ability : inter@@ acting factors that are having a growing impact on the market for syn@@ thetic drugs
the illi@@ cit market and its suppliers show high levels of innovation in terms of production processes , new products and marketing opportunities , as well as demonstrating the ability to adap@@ t quickly to control measures .
effects on the avail@@ ability and use of other substan@@ ces .
for example , there are some signs that meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine may be dis@@ placing amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine in parts of northern Europe .
again , market factors and prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als appear important here , with meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine production sites appe@@ aring now to be located in Lithuania , whose geographical position facilit@@ ates the import of prec@@ ur@@ sors , in this case 1 @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ en@@ y@@ l @@@ -@@ @ 2 @@@ -@@ @ pro@@ pan@@ one ( BM@@ K ) , from outside of the European Union .
the situation in Nordic countries adds to concerns about the possible ou@@ tw@@ ard di@@ ff@@ usion of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use beyond the Czech Republic .
in this country , meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine problems are long established , but with production usually on a small scale for personal or local consumption .
there is also some evidence that meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use is growing quickly in some of the countries bor@@ dering the European Union .
the speed at which problems can develop is illu@@ strated by Slovakia , which provides a recent case study of a country where meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use has grown significantly .
the Internet and marketing : is " sp@@ ice " a tas@@ te of things to come ?
until 2007 , most ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets analy@@ sed in Europe contained 3,4 @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ y@@ len@@ edi@@ ox@@ y @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine ( M@@ D@@ MA ) or another ec@@ st@@ asy @@@ -@@ @ like sub@@ stance .
in up to half of all tab@@ lets analy@@ sed in these countries , no M@@ D@@ MA or any of its anal@@ o@@ gues were found .
it can@@ not yet be said if this development is a temporary di@@ gres@@ sion or marks a more significant transition in the ec@@ st@@ asy market .
changes in the ec@@ st@@ asy market may point to increasingly successful efforts to prevent the di@@ version of prec@@ ur@@ sor chem@@ ic@@ als , and these efforts may also have important
this year , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA launched a first review of Internet treatment approaches , and it appears that , for some forms of prevention , treatment and harm@@ reduction interven@@ tions , the web @@@ -@@ @ based approaches have considerable potential .
added to the concerns raised by the online marketing of alcohol and medicin@@ es are those about the appearance of a range of sup@@ pos@@ edly " legal " alternatives to controlled psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe ob@@ sc@@ ure research compo@@ unds , some are extremely po@@ tent , and little is known about their effects on hum@@ ans .
this market has grown over the last few years , and now includes a wide range of plant @@@ -@@ @ based products , in particular her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures , as well as mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise containing syn@@ thetic compo@@ unds .
new substan@@ ces appe@@ aring on the Internet market can range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world , to experim@@ ental chem@@ ic@@ als syn@@ th@@ es@@ ised in laborat@@ ories and un@@ tested in hum@@ ans .
other innov@@ ations include the development of distinc@@ t brands and the use of attractive pack@@ aging .
a no@@ table example of this is the her@@ bal mi@@ x@@ tures that have been mar@@ ke@@ ted under the " sp@@ ice " la@@ bel .
numerous brands of " sp@@ ice " have been found with different pack@@ aging and different ing@@ redi@@ ent lists .

attempts to circum@@ v@@ ent drug control by marketing un@@ regulated sub@@ stitu@@ tes are not new .
" sp@@ ice " may also provide us with a warning of problems to come .
the ability of sophisticated chem@@ ists , often located outside of European juris@@ dic@@ tions , to cheap@@ ly conduct organ@@ ic syn@@ th@@ es@@ is , potentially provides access to a considerable number of psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces .
moreover , as some of these substan@@ ces may have legitimate uses or be sold sup@@ pos@@ edly for legitimate purposes , they can fall between drug control and trade regulation .

EU drugs action plan ( 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 12 ) : new features
the new UN document is similar in content to the original UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS declar@@ ations and action plans agreed in 1998 .
it includes many of the elements put forward by the European Union , as can be seen in the plan of action , which re@@ views current drug policy problems and lists the actions that UN M@@ ember States have committed themselves to implementing during the next decade .
through setting up a " European Action on Dru@@ gs , " the action plan aims to stimulate European civil society 's commitment about and action on drug problems .
the action plan also calls on M@@ ember States to involve civil society at all appropriate levels of drug policy .
it also examined the action plan 's impact on the national drug policies of EU M@@ ember States and looked at recent trends in Europe 's drug situation .
most of the actions related to supply reduction are aimed at improving law enforcement and judicial co@@ operation between M@@ ember States , often through increased use of EU bodies , projects and tools .
the evaluation found that while not all actions had been fully implemented and not all objectives at@@ tained , progress had been made in almost all areas of the action plan .
moreover , the fact that most national drug policy documents contain objectives that ech@@ o those of the EU action plan was noted as evidence of increasing conver@@ gence among European countries in the field of drug policy .
a relative stabilisation of Europe 's drug situation in recent years was also observed , but the contribution of the EU action plan to this trend could not be determined .
a better ref@@ le@@ ction of the balanced approach between demand and supply reduction is also pursu@@ ed in external agreements and programmes .

national drug strategies and action plans
civil society and drug policy@@ making
drug strategies and action plans are now essential instruments of national drug policies in Europe .
all but one of the 30 countries monitored by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA have adopted such documents , which they ren@@ ew peri@@ o@@ dic@@ ally .
in 2008 , new drug policy documents ( 6 ) were adopted by Greece , France and the United Kingdom .
a key priority of the plan is to dis@@ su@@ ade young people from beginning to use drugs by re@@ affir@@ ming the prohibi@@ tion of drug use and in@@ forming young people and their parents about the risks related to drug use .
the involvement of non@@ governmental organisations ( NGOs ) in the prepar@@ atory discussions for the new EU and UN drug policy documents represents an important step in the engagement of civil society in this field of policy .
in May 2008 , the European Commission 's Civil Society Forum on Dru@@ gs debated the first results of the evaluation of the EU drug action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) and discussed the needs and possible contents of the following action plan ( European Commission , 200@@ 8@@ a ) .
ten other EU M@@ ember States had national drug policy documents exp@@ iring in 2008 .
Spain adopted a new drug strategy in February 2009 , and eight other countries ( Bulgaria , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Cyprus , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia ) were in the process of fin@@ alising and adopting new drug strategies and action plans during the first half of 2009 ; Latvia extended its 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 programme with a 1 @@@ -@@ @ year action plan .
the contribution of NGOs to the progress made in achieving the goals set at the 1998 UN@@ G@@ A@@ SS was reviewed by the Vienna NGO Committee on narco@@ tic Dru@@ gs , with financial support from the European Commission and several EU M@@ ember States .
policy documents .
in most cases , a progress report based on data collected from service providers and ministries involved in drug policy is submitted to the government or parliament .
most countries could provide data on central government expendi@@ ture , and seven also reported expendi@@ ture by regional or local government ( Belgium , Denmark , Estonia , Austria , Finland , Croatia ) or from social security funds ( Germany ) .
la@@ bel@@ led and un@@ la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture
in some cases , the final report is a sum@@ m@@ ary of annual implementation re@@ views ; in others , there is an attempt to get a deeper understanding of the implementation process , of the effectiveness or of the impact of the policy .
of the countries taking the more in @@@ -@@ @ dep@@ th approach to evaluation , two ( Luxembourg , Cyprus ) have decided to work with external evalu@@ ators from outside the country .
la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture is the planned dru@@ g@@ related public expendi@@ ture made by the general government of the state .
of the 23 countries providing data for 2007 , 16 reported only la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture .
drug policy evalu@@ ations face considerable difficulties in their attempts to link the out@@ puts of drug strategies or action plans with changes in the drug situation .
nevertheless , attempts to establish links between drug strategies or action plans and indicators of the drug situation have been made by some European countries .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is also developing guidelines to help M@@ ember States assess and interpre@@ t the results of their drug policy documents .
not all dru@@ g@@ related expendi@@ ture is identified as such in national budgets .
in most countries , the amount expen@@ ded in some dru@@ g@@ related activities is em@@ bed@@ ded in other programmes and interven@@ tions ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . overall police operations budget , or interven@@ tions targeting both li@@ cit and illi@@ cit substan@@ ces ) .
in these cases , such " un@@ la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture " must be estimated by a cost @@@ -@@ @ model@@ ling approach .
the results of earlier studies show that , in most cases , un@@ la@@ bel@@ led expendi@@ ture represents the greater part of the national expendi@@ ture on the drugs problem .
esti@@ m@@ ating in economic terms the resources deployed by the state in response to the use of illi@@ cit drugs is therefore an essential step towards understanding the wider impact of drug use .
estimates of public expendi@@ ture are based on government budgets and accoun@@ tancy documents .
however , esti@@ m@@ ating the total expendi@@ ture inc@@ urred in implementing national
public expendi@@ ture related to drugs can be categor@@ ised according to the clas@@ si@@ fication of the functions of government ( C@@ O@@ FO@@ G ) system ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ e ) .
in these three countries , " health " received the highest pro@@ portion of the total disbur@@ sement , followed by " public order and safety " ( T@@ able 1 ) .
in contrast , for those countries providing C@@ O@@ FO@@ G data for un@@ la@@ bel@@ led
the C@@ O@@ FO@@ G clas@@ si@@ fication has three hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ical levels . at the first level , government expendi@@ ture is broken down into 10 functions .

hal@@ f@@ way through the period , two EU instruments gave added impetus to these processes .
ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes
in Belgium and Germany , this issue has been addressed with a clause in the law that specifically exemp@@ ts certain programmes from any such charge , although limits may be placed on the number of sy@@ r@@ inges dis@@ pen@@ sed .
in a few countries , gu@@ idance is issued to the police on appropriate law enforcement practice near ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge outlets .
overall , police confis@@ cation of ster@@ ile sy@@ r@@ inges or ne@@ ed@@ les is reported to be rare across the European Union .
penalties for trafficking
since then , four more countries have passed laws to bring basic trafficking penalties into line with the decision .
in 1999 , Ireland created the new off@@ ence of possession of a large amount of drugs ( worth more than EU@@ R 12 700 ) with intent to supply , which would carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years " imprisonment .
in 2000 , the United Kingdom introduced a minimum sentence of 7 years " imprisonment for a third conviction of trafficking in class A drugs , and in 2001 Greece

this year , refer@@ ences to national research in the latest Re@@ it@@ o@@ x reports are analy@@ sed to provide an in@@ sight into the research recently conducted in European countries .
also reported on in this section is a study on dru@@ g@@ related research in the EU released this year by the European Commission .
research projects in M@@ ember States
European countries referred to more than 350 research projects undertaken or published in 2007 and 2008 in the latest Re@@ it@@ o@@ x national reports .
the United Kingdom referred to the highest number of research projects , over 80 , followed by Germany and the Netherlands , each with over 30 , and the Czech Republic , Ireland and Finland , with over 20 .
the report noted prevention , legal fra@@ me@@ works and inter@@ diction as other fields dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately under@@ resear@@ ched , while research on ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological topics was found to be more common ( 11 ) .
the study found that , although comprehensive expertise exists in M@@ ember States , improved data compar@@ ability between countries and increased visi@@ bility of research should be pursu@@ ed .
among the subject areas that appeared to attract considerably less research attention were : determin@@ ants and risk and protec@@ tive factors , mechanisms and effects of drugs , supply and markets , and meth@@ od@@ ological issues .
the results of this analysis , while limited in scope , give support to the new EU action plan 's calls for increased

introduction in all these countries .
the effectiveness of this type of intervention , however , is not supported by the available evidence .
however , interven@@ tions with better scientific foundations , such as prevention programmes following stand@@ ardis@@ ed protocols , are now reported from additional countries ( Czech Republic , Cyprus , Austria , Poland , Slovenia , Slovakia ) .
this chapter presents an over@@ view of the responses to drug problems in Europe , where possible highligh@@ ting trends , developments and quality issues .
prevention measures are first reviewed followed by interven@@ tions in the areas of treatment , harm reduction and social re@@ integration .
taken together , all these measures form a comprehensive drug demand reduction system .
they can be considered as comple@@ mentary , and are sometimes provided in combination and by the same facilities .
this is , for example , increasingly the case for treatment and harm reduction measures .
the limited number of prevention programmes of proven effectiveness is being addressed in Europe by the EU @@@ -@@ @ D@@ ap study ( www.@@ eu@@ d@@ ap@@ .net ) .
involving 7 000 students aged 12 @@@ -@@ @ 14 in seven European countries , the study is evalu@@ ating a programme based on the comprehensive social influence approach , which combin@@ es training in life @@@ -@@ @ skills with norm@@ ative education and knowledge acquisition on substan@@ ces .
the responses developed in the framework of drug law enforcement are also addressed in a new section which includes the most recent data on drug law offences .
the chapter ends with a review of the available data on the needs of drug users in prisons and the existing responses in this particular setting .
I@@ de@@ ally , the different strategies do not compete but comple@@ ment each other .
gender @@@ -@@ @ dependent effects also came up in a Danish controlled trial on a life @@@ -@@ @ skills programme .
girls accounted for the largest effect in terms of bul@@ lying , past @@@ -@@ @ week and past @@@ -@@ @ month alcohol consumption , while boys accounted for the largest effect for drinking more than five drin@@ ks on one occasion and having tried can@@ na@@ bis .
it aims to de@@ ter or delay the on@@ set of drug use and dru@@ g@@ related problems by providing young people with the information and skills necessary to avoid starting to use drugs .
prevention measures undertaken in Europe are now , for the first time , being system@@ atically monitored by the majority of M@@ ember States .
selec@@ tive and indicated prevention
new information on selec@@ tive prevention targeting ethnic groups has been reported by Belgium and Luxembourg .
both selec@@ tive and indicated prevention acknowledge that problem drug use is concentrated in vulnerable groups or individuals with limited social and personal opportunities ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ c ) .
selec@@ tive prevention interven@@ es with specific groups , families or communities , where people , due to their scar@@ ce social ties and resources , may be more likely to develop drug use or progress into dependency .
the evidence base for this approach is presented in a new section of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA 's Best practice portal ( 12 ) .
indicated prevention aims to identify individuals with behavi@@ our@@ al or psychological problems that may be predic@@ tive for developing problem sub@@ stance use later in life , and to target them individually with special interven@@ tions .
sub@@ stance @@@ -@@ @ specific mass media campaigns
similarly , the " Ko@@ met f@@ ör f@@ ör@@ ä@@ ld@@ rar " method , which is used in nearly 30 % of Sweden 's municipalities , targets parents of children showing ex@@ ter@@ n@@ alising behaviour problems combined with difficulties in establishing positive pe@@ er relations .
almost all these campaigns warn of the dangers of using the drug , and some of them use shock tactics .
only two campaigns take a different approach .
the United Kingdom @@@ -@@ @ Col@@ om@@ bi@@ an campaign " Shar@@ ed responsibility " addresses the responsibility of users for the environmental and social harm associated with cocaine production .
the Dutch can@@ na@@ bis campaign in 2006 targeted norm@@ ative beli@@ efs with real @@@ -@@ @ life stories of young people as positive role models , instead of warnings and depic@@ tion of use .
its evaluation found that negative social norms against can@@ na@@ bis smoking were rein@@ forced and that there were no negative effects on intention to use and on norm@@ ative beli@@ efs ( W@@ am@@ mes et al . , 2007 ) .
around 400 000 drug users are reported to have entered drug treatment in 2007 ( 14 ) .
this pro@@ portion has grown in recent years for various reasons , including the increased avail@@ ability and diversi@@ fication of specialised out@@ patient treatment .
mass media campaigns highligh@@ ting the danger of drug use are only rarely evalu@@ ated for changes in behaviour , attitudes or intention to use drugs .
in addition , concerns have been expressed about their poor effectiveness and possible harm .
for example , a thorough evaluation of the outcome of the US national can@@ na@@ bis campaign revealed no overall effects .
there was , however , evidence that the campaign had un@@ intended effects in favour of can@@ na@@ bis , and individuals who had previously been un@@ interested in the drug , reported an intention to use it ( Hor@@ nik et al . , 2008 ) .
similar problems were reported in the evaluation of the S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh cocaine campaign " K@@ now the score " ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 7@@ a ) .
decision @@@ -@@ @ making by young people is a complex process , strongly influenced by pe@@ er group inter@@ actions and perception of social norms .
so far , mass media communication appears not to have responded effectively to this complex@@ ity .

it is generally provided in in@@ patient sett@@ ings .
the relative size of the different treatment mod@@ alities in each country is influenced by several factors , including the organisation of the national health care system .
out@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is mostly provided by public institutions ( 16 countries ) or by non@@ governmental organisations ( 10 countries ) .
according to national experts , this type of treatment is available to the majority of those who seek it in 10 countries , and available to nearly all of them in a further 13 countries .
in four countries ( Bulgaria , Estonia , Romania , Turkey ) , however , out@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ A ) .
these ratings may hide considerable vari@@ ation within countries and differences in the avail@@ ability of specialised treatment programmes for can@@ na@@ bis or cocaine users .
sub@@ stitution treatment combined with psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial care is the pre@@ dominant treatment option for op@@ i@@ oid users in Europe .
it is generally provided as an out@@ patient treatment , though in some countries it is also available in in@@ patient sett@@ ings .
for example , in Austria , 65 % of clients undergoing long @@@ -@@ @ term in@@ patient treatment are pres@@ cri@@ bed slow @@@ -@@ @ release mor@@ ph@@ ine .
sub@@ stitution treatment is also increasingly provided in prisons ( 17 ) .
drug users entering treatment in out@@ patient sett@@ ings are predominantly young men , with an average age of 31 years and mal@@ es almost four times as numerous as fem@@ al@@ es ( 3.@@ 7 : 1 ) .
the age and sex profile of treatment clients var@@ ies with primary drug .
can@@ na@@ bis clients are on average much younger ( 25 ) than op@@ i@@ oid ( 32 ) and cocaine ( 33 ) clients .
regardless of primary drug , the average age of clients entering treatment for the first time is about 2 years lower than that of all clients .
with the introduction of high @@@ -@@ @ dos@@ age bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine treatment in Cyprus in 2007 , op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is now available in all EU M@@ ember States , as well as Croatia and Norway ( 18 ) .
in Turkey , sub@@ stitution treatment has yet to be introduced , though it is per@@ mitted under a 2004 regulation on treatment centres . in 16 countries , specialised public out@@ patient services are the main providers of sub@@ stitution treatment .

annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
treatment guidelines include recommendations based on scientific evidence , expert opinion , service us@@ er pre@@ ferences and national health care systems .
they are designed to help choose and apply the appropriate drug treatment interven@@ tions .
in 20 out of 27 reporting countries , national drug treatment guidelines are drawn up by an authorised institution .
the mean age of drug users entering in@@ patient treatment is 30 years , but op@@ i@@ oid and cocaine clients are on average older ( 31 ) than those in treatment for non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 28 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 26 ) .
most in@@ patient clients are men , with an overall male to female rati@@ o of 3.6 : 1 .
the rati@@ o is lower among primary users of non @@@ -@@ @ cocaine sti@@ mul@@ ants ( 2.2 : 1 ) and higher among users of cocaine ( 5.@@ 1 : 1 ) and can@@ na@@ bis ( 8 : 1 ) .
existing guidelines cover , in particular , pharmac@@ ological drug treatment .
national guidelines for sub@@ stitution treatment are reported by 18 countries , and 11 countries report guidelines for de@@ to@@ x@@ ification .
however , about one third of these countries do not report ad@@ her@@ ence to the guidelines as a condition for operating or receiving funding for a treatment facility .
the main providers of in@@ patient treatment are non@@ governmental organisations ( 12 countries ) and public institutions ( 11 countries ) .
national experts estimate that in@@ patient psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment is available to the majority of those seeking it in 12 countries and to almost all who seek it in a further nine countries .
however , in six countries ( Bulgaria , Denmark , Estonia , France , Hungary , Romania ) , this treatment mod@@ ality was considered to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
national guidelines for psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment and social re@@ integration are less common .
the scar@@ city of national guidelines is probably due to the limited evidence available , and this points to the need for more mul@@ tis@@ ite r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials in these fields .
D@@ et@@ ox@@ ification is generally a prerequisite to initiate long @@@ -@@ @ term , abst@@ in@@ ence @@@ -@@ @ based residential treatment .
it is com@@ mon@@ ly , but not exclusively , an in@@ patient intervention provided in hospitals , specialist treatment centres or residential facilities with medical or psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric wards .
most countries make similar training opportunities available to other professionals including nurses , social workers and psych@@ ologists .
regular outcome evalu@@ ations for all types of drug treatment are reported by few countries .
five M@@ ember States evaluate sub@@ stitution and de@@ to@@ x@@ ification treatment , and only Denmark , Germany and the United Kingdom evaluate the outcome of psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treatment interven@@ tions on a regular basis .
single or ir@@ regular treatment outcome evalu@@ ations are also reported by some countries .
public institutions are the main providers of de@@ to@@ x@@ ification in 21 countries .
non@@ governmental organisations are the largest providers in Belgium ( F@@ lan@@ ders ) and the Netherlands , while the private sector is pre@@ dominant in Luxembourg and Bulgaria .
national experts estimate that de@@ to@@ x@@ ification is available to a majority of those who seek it in nine countries , and to almost all in a further 10 .
in eight countries ( Estonia , Ireland , Greece , France , Latvia , Romania , Slovenia , Norway ) , de@@ to@@ x@@ ification is estimated to be available to less than half of those who actively seek it ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 1@@ D ) .
quality assur@@ ance
among the main interven@@ tions in this field are op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment and ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge exchange programmes ,
health plan@@ ners and policymakers in Europe increasingly look for mechanisms to ensure high quality in drug treatment .
they also tend to give priority to " evi@@ den@@ ce@@ based " interven@@ tions when considering the provision of treatment and the allocation of funds .

the treatment mo@@ dul@@ e presents the findings of studies that compar@@ e the e@@ ffic@@ acy of different interven@@ tions .
e@@ ffic@@ acy is ide@@ ally determined by carrying out controlled trials or r@@ and@@ om@@ ised controlled trials where interven@@ tions are compared against specific outcome measures . most of the evidence base in this area comes from studies conducted in the United States .
Studies in Europe are now becoming more common , and include some ground @@@ -@@ @ breaking work on new agents for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment .
responsibility for quality assur@@ ance lies with national institutions in 14 countries , while in countries with a federal system , agencies at sub @@@ -@@ @ national level can be in charge .

these measures are reported to be available in all countries except Turkey .
this figure is likely to be much higher for certain groups of drug users .
most countries provide a range of health care and social services , including individual risk assessment and advice , safer use training , inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases testing and coun@@ selling , vacc@@ ination and treatment of vir@@ al hep@@ ati@@ tis .
these services are often provided at low@@ threshold agencies .
the focus of harm reduction responses has expanded beyond the HIV / AIDS ep@@ i@@ demic into the broader perspective of cat@@ ering for the health and social needs of problem drug users , especially those who are socially excluded .
all M@@ ember States report the avail@@ ability of housing sch@@ e@@ mes that can accommodate drug users .
information on the extent to which the housing needs of drug users are met , however , is scar@@ ce .
a process of profession@@ alisation can also be observed in recent years , and more scrutiny is applied to assure high quality standards .
for example , in 2006 / 07 , harm reduction services in England were inspec@@ ted in order to identify areas for improvement .
quality may also be assured through stip@@ ulating ad@@ her@@ ence to specific standards in funding contracts , as reported by the Czech Republic and Estonia .
annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe
in Ireland , for example , users are responsible for paying the rent and some domestic services , while support workers help them with their ten@@ ancy and to gain access to education , training or employment .
this is because many drug offences can be viewed as a " consen@@ su@@ al crime , " where con@@ sent@@ ing individuals secre@@ tly participate in an un@@ law@@ ful activity of which the police will remain unaware unless discovered by chance ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . during a fo@@ ot patrol ) or by active detection .
the value of this approach is supported by the results of a S@@ co@@ tti@@ sh study , which found that recover@@ ing drug users who received employment @@@ -@@ @ related support were three times more likely to have found paid employment ( Mc@@ In@@ tos@@ h et al . , 2008 ) .
as a consequence , drug law enforcement includes a large set of activities which often rely on the gathering , processing and sharing of information by human and electronic means , including compu@@ ter@@ ised datab@@ ases and dedicated communication networks .
controlled deliveries of drugs and targeted operations aimed at dis@@ rup@@ ting or eliminating drug selling points are some of the operational tactics used by law enforcement agencies in Europe .
performing checks and sear@@ ches on people and vehicles at and around strategic locations , such as ports , airports and land borders , is a more gener@@ ic tac@@ tic , which also includes other aims , such as immigration control .
among the areas covered are drug use and possession , trafficking and production , as well as di@@ version of chem@@ ic@@ als and money laundering .
law enforcement institutions , especially customs , are also tasked in many countries with enfor@@ cing laws on controlled chem@@ ic@@ als .
this involves processing impor@@ tation and expor@@ tation requests as well as identi@@ fying and investigating suspicious transactions .

this raises issues around the potential spread of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases among the prison population .
according to expert ratings , however , there are differences in the provision of this intervention .
prisoners are entitled to the same level of medical care as persons living in the community , and prison health services should be able to provide treatment for problems related to drug use in conditions compar@@ able to those offered outside prison ( C@@ P@@ T , 2006 ; WHO , 2007 ) .

introduction
supply and avail@@ ability
can@@ na@@ bis can be cultiv@@ ated in a wide range of environ@@ ments and gro@@ ws wild in many parts of the world .
it is currently estimated that can@@ na@@ bis is cultiv@@ ated in 17@@ 2 countries and territories ( UNODC , 2009 ) ( 44 ) .
these facts taken together mean that it is difficult to produce accur@@ ate estimates of the worldwide production of can@@ na@@ bis .
the UNODC ( 2009 ) estimates global production of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in 2008 at between 13 300 tonnes and 66 100 tonnes .
can@@ na@@ bis cultiv@@ ation in Europe is widespread and possibly increasing ( Kor@@ f , 2008 ) .
in 2007 , 19 European countries mentioned domestic can@@ na@@ bis cultiv@@ ation , though the scale of the phenomenon seems to v@@ ary considerably .
her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis in Europe is also imported , mostly from Africa ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Ni@@ ger@@ ia , Mor@@ oc@@ co , Ghana , South Africa )
the use of can@@ na@@ bis in Europe has evol@@ ved considerably over the last decade , as has the debate on how to respond appropri@@ ately to the widespread use of this drug .
moreover , the last few years have seen a growing understanding of the public health implications of the long @@@ -@@ @ term and widespread use of this drug , and rising reported levels of treatment demand for can@@ na@@ bis related problems .
Europe may now be moving into a new phase , as data from general population and school surveys point to a stabil@@ ising or even decreas@@ ing situation .

the number of plants seized was 2.@@ 4 million , a figure that has been relatively stable over the past 2 years , up from about 1.5 million in 2002 .
Po@@ ten@@ cy and price
global production of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in in 2008 is estimated at between 2 200 tonnes and 9 900 tonnes ( UNODC , 2009 ) , with Mor@@ oc@@ co continuing to be the main producer .
the area under can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in production is reported to have declined from 13@@ 4 000 hectares to 76 400 hectares between 2003 and 2005 ( UNODC and Government of Mor@@ oc@@ co , 2007 ) .
res@@ in production is also reported in other countries , including Afghanistan and Pakistan ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
north America continued to account for the bul@@ k of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seized ( 66 % ) , while quantities of res@@ in seized remained concentrated in western and central Europe ( 66 % ) ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
systematic and rout@@ ine information to describe illi@@ cit drug markets and trafficking is still limited .
the amount of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seized hal@@ ved during the first 2 years of this period there@@ after increasing , though remaining well below the 130 tonnes seized in 2002 .
the highest number of seiz@@ ures of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis was reported by the United Kingdom , accounting for approximately half of the total in 2005 and 2006 .
drug seiz@@ ures are often considered as an indirect indicator of the supply , trafficking routes and avail@@ ability of drugs .
they are a more direct indicator of drug law enforcement activities ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . priorities , resources , strategies ) , while also reflecting both reporting practices and the vulner@@ ability of traffickers .
seiz@@ ures of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in in Europe exceed her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis seiz@@ ures , both in number and amount seized (
between 2002 and 2007 , the number of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in seiz@@ ures increased , though the amount seized f@@ luc@@ tu@@ ated over the same period .

annual report 2009 : the state of the drugs problem in Europe include those using the drug more regularly , though not necessarily in an intensive way .
it is estimated that about 12 million Europeans used the drug in the last month , on average about 3.6 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .
population surveys : an important tool for understanding drug use pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends in Europe
drug use in the general or school population can be meas@@ ured through representative surveys , which provide estimates of the pro@@ portion of individuals that report having used specific drugs over defined periods of time .
surveys also provide useful Con@@ tex@@ tual information on pat@@ ter@@ ns of use , soci@@ o@@ demographic character@@ isti@@ cs of users and perceptions of risks and avail@@ ability .
the extent to which the samples analy@@ sed reflect the overall market is unclear and , for this reason , data on poten@@ cy should be interpreted with caution .
in 2007 , the reported national mean TH@@ C content of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in ran@@ ged from 2.9 % to 13.@@ 3 % .
the mean poten@@ cy of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis , exclu@@ ding home @@@ -@@ @ grown s@@ ins@@ em@@ il@@ la ( " n@@ eder@@ wi@@ et " ) in the Netherlands , ran@@ ged from 1.2 % to 10.@@ 2 % .
however , up@@ ward trends in the mean TH@@ C content of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in were registered in Portugal and Luxembourg .
information on the poten@@ cy of loc@@ ally produced her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis over a number of years is available only for the Netherlands , where a recent decline in the mean poten@@ cy of n@@ eder@@ wi@@ et was observed , from a peak of 20.@@ 3 % in 2004 to 16.@@ 0 % in 2006 , remaining at that level in 2007 ( 47 ) .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , in close collaboration with national experts , has developed a set of core items for use in ad@@ ult surveys ( the " European Mo@@ del Qu@@ esti@@ onnaire , " E@@ M@@ Q ) .
surveys are expensive to conduct and few European countries collect information each year , although many collect it at inter@@ vals of two to four years .
in this report , data is presented based on the most recent survey available in each country , which in most cases is between 2004 and 2007 .
the mean retail price of can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in , in 2007 , ran@@ ged from EU@@ R 3 to EU@@ R 11 per gram in the 18 countries providing information , with half of them reporting values between EU@@ R 5 and EU@@ R 9 .
the mean retail price of her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis ran@@ ged between EU@@ R 1 and EU@@ R 12 per gram in the 17 countries sup@@ plying information , with about half of them reporting prices of between EU@@ R 4 and EU@@ R 9 .
the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs ( ES@@ PA@@ D ) uses stand@@ ardis@@ ed methods and instruments to measure drug and alcohol use among representative samples of 15@@ - to 16 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old school students .
surveys have been conducted in 1995 , 1999 , 2003 and 2007 .
considerable differences exist between countries , with national pre@@ val@@ ence figures var@@ ying from 1.5 % to 38.@@ 6 % .
for most of the countries , the pre@@ val@@ ence estimates are in the range 10 @@@ -@@ @ 30 % .
it is estimated that around 2@@ 2.5 million Europeans have used can@@ na@@ bis in the last year , or on average 6.@@ 8 % of all 15@@ - to 64 @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ ol@@ ds .

can@@ na@@ bis use is generally higher among mal@@ es than among fem@@ al@@ es ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 6@@ a ) , though marked differences between countries are observed .

for instance , in the United States , the National survey on drug use and health ( Sam@@ h@@ sa , 2007 ) estimated a lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence of can@@ na@@ bis use of 49 %
the trend in can@@ na@@ bis use in the United Kingdom is particularly interesting .
in the early and mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , this country stood out in the European picture as the one reporting the highest pre@@ val@@ ence estimates .
this picture has pro@@ gres@@ sively changed , as levels of use rose in other countries .
moreover , can@@ na@@ bis use in the United Kingdom has been steadily declining since around 2003 , particularly among the 16 @@@ -@@ @ 24 age group ( 52 ) , suggesting a gener@@ ational shift .
a down@@ ward or stabil@@ ising trend can now be seen elsewhere , in both school and some general population survey data .
in three countries , pre@@ val@@ ence levels have increased by at least 15 % , although other data put this up@@ ward trend into question .

as with adults , increases in can@@ na@@ bis use among school students occurred in a number of European countries between 1995 and 2003 , but in general have come to a halt or decreased more recently .
only two of the countries monitored by the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA that participated in ES@@ PA@@ D school surveys in 2007 ( Lithuania , Slovakia ) report an increase of more than three percentage points in lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use since 2003 , while nine countries report an equivalent decrease during this period ( 54 ) .

the 2007 ES@@ PA@@ D surveys also show that lif@@ etime can@@ na@@ bis use is cor@@ related with perceptions of lower risk and higher avail@@ ability of the drug ( 62
compared with the general population of students , can@@ na@@ bis users are more likely to use alcohol , tobacco and other illi@@ cit drugs ( 63
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is therefore developing , in collaboration with several countries , methods for monitoring the more intensive and significant long @@@ -@@ @ term forms of can@@ na@@ bis use .
different meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies to estimate , within the general population surveys , the pre@@ val@@ ence of intensive and problematic forms of drug use , mainly can@@ na@@ bis use , have been tested in recent years .
clients entering out@@ patient centres because of can@@ na@@ bis use often also report the use of other drugs .
additional val@@ idation studies , which are currently in progress or planned , might help overcome these difficulties .

internet @@@ -@@ @ based treatment
internet @@@ -@@ @ based drug treatment has existed in the European Union since 2004 and its provision is still limited .
a recent study provides in@@ sights into the current state of development of this type of intervention in the European Union ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 9@@ a ) .
internet @@@ -@@ @ based treatment can be defined as " specifically elabor@@ ated or adap@@ ted , struc@@ tured and scheduled drug treatment interven@@ tions , offered in and communic@@ ated over the World W@@ ide Web . "
F@@ red ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) offers motiv@@ ational inter@@ viewing @@@ -@@ @ based coun@@ selling for those referred by the criminal justice system .
internet @@@ -@@ @ based treatment is developed by organisations in the treatment or prevention fields and aims at helping users to assess their sub@@ stance use and to assist them in their attempts to change this behaviour .
interven@@ tions provide information and knowledge tests or games about drugs and drug dependence , or drug consumption self @@@ -@@ @ tests .
the latter can be implemented via one @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ one ch@@ ats or message boards .
Contact with other users via a forum is also sometimes provided , there@@ by creating virtual self @@@ -@@ @ help groups .
the scientific literature suggests that a number of psy@@ cho@@ ther@@ ap@@ ies , such as motiv@@ ational and cogn@@ iti@@ ve@@ behavi@@ our@@ al ther@@ ap@@ ies , are effective for can@@ na@@ bis treatment but that none has been found to be more effective than the others ( N@@ ord@@ strom and L@@ evin , 2007 ) .
some problem can@@ na@@ bis users may also benefit from brief interven@@ tions , delivered for example by social services for juven@@ il@@ es , general practi@@ tion@@ ers and schools .
preliminary evaluation results of the " Qu@@ it the shi@@ t " intervention for can@@ na@@ bis users in Germany has shown that 32 % of participants reported abst@@ in@@ ence after completing the programme and that first @@@ -@@ @ time treatment seekers , in particular , were reached .
( M@@ D@@ MA ) , but other anal@@ o@@ gues are also sometimes found in ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets ( M@@ DA , M@@ D@@ EA ) .
moreover , in some countries , use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines constitu@@ tes an important part of the drug problem , accounting for a substantial pro@@ portion of those in need of treatment .
the most widely known syn@@ thetic hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic drug in Europe is ly@@ ser@@ gic ac@@ id di@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ide ( L@@ SD ) , consumption of which has been low and somewhat stable for a considerable time .

between 2005 and 2007 , both the number and the quanti@@ ty of meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine seized in Europe have been increasing , though both remain low in comparison to other drugs .
over the past 5 years , the p@@ urity of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has been stable or falling in most of those 20 countries where sufficient data are available to allow analysis of trends .
of the 11 countries where a comparison of data for 2007 and 2006 was possible , Spain , France and Austria reported increases in the retail price , while the rest reported stable or decreas@@ ing prices .
global ec@@ st@@ asy seiz@@ ures in 2007 reached 7.@@ 9 tonnes , with increases reported in most regions .
West and central Europe accounted for 36 % of the global seiz@@ ures , and southeast Europe for 2 % ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
overall , more than 24 000 seiz@@ ures , resulting in the inter@@ cep@@ tion of an estimated 13 million ec@@ st@@ asy tab@@ lets were reported in Europe in 2007 .

over the period 2002 @@@ -@@ @ 07 , the number of ec@@ st@@ asy seiz@@ ures reported in Europe dropped sharply in 2003 , but has since shown a slight increase year on year .
over the same period , the quanti@@ ty seized declined to a low in 2005 , but has increased again , and appears to be approaching the 2002 level .

users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines generally receive treatment in out@@ patient drug services which , in countries with histor@@ ies of significant levels of the use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , can be specialised in tre@@ ating this type of drug problem .
treatment for the most problematic users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines may be provided in in@@ patient drug services or in psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric clinics or hospitals .

lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence estimates ran@@ ged from 15 % to 71 % for ec@@ st@@ asy use and from 17 % to 68 % for amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines .
four of these studies also reported lif@@ etime pre@@ val@@ ence estimates for hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms , ranging from 4 % to 64 % .
frequent use of ec@@ st@@ asy or amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines can also be found in these sett@@ ings but it is generally much lower .

specific treatment programmes for problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines users are reported in nine countries ( Germany , Estonia , Spain , Italy , Austria , Portugal , Slovenia , Slovakia , United Kingdom ) .
the avail@@ ability of these programmes var@@ ies between countries .
only three of these countries ( Portugal , Slovenia , United Kingdom ) report that specialised programmes are available to the majority of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines users who actively seek treatment .
in the other six countries , national experts estimate that specialised amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines treatment is available to less than half of the users seeking it .
the content of these specific programmes for users of these drugs is often not well documented .
the health and safety of people who attend night@@ clubs and use drugs is a growing public health concern .
guidelines , such as the " Saf@@ er dan@@ cing " guidelines developed in the United Kingdom , have become an important tool in this field .
however , while 12 countries now report having developed such guidelines for night@@ life venues , only the Netherlands , Slovenia , Sweden and the United Kingdom report that they are monitored and enforced .
promising results have been reported for recent investigations on pharmac@@ ological agents to manage abst@@ in@@ ence or reduce the cra@@ v@@ ings associated with amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines dependence , which up to now have been lacking .
D@@ examp@@ het@@ am@@ ine has long been available for the treatment of highly problematic users of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines in England and Wal@@ es , where it may be pres@@ cri@@ bed by any doctor . however , information on this practice in the United Kingdom is limited .

however , the United Kingdom guidelines on clin@@ ical management of drug dependence recommend against sub@@ stitute pres@@ cri@@ bing of de@@ x@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness ( N@@ TA , 2007 ) .
as yet , no one psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial intervention has shown strong evidence of effectiveness in helping psych@@ os@@ ti@@ mul@@ ant users to maintain abst@@ in@@ ence .
in the literature , the interven@@ tions that have demonstrated the most e@@ ffic@@ acy in tre@@ ating users of sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs are cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al approaches such as rela@@ p@@ se prevention .
the effectiveness of other types of intervention is not well supported .
the literature is particularly hin@@ dered by the pa@@ uc@@ ity of wel@@ l@@ conducted studies among primary amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users , especially treatment outcome studies ( Bak@@ er et al . , 2004 ) .
further research into psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial and pharmac@@ ological treatment for those with problems related to the use of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines , especially in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors , is needed .
current treatment practices and treatment coverage in Europe also needs to be better documented , and much remains to be done in the sharing of best practice .
the lack of dedicated programmes might be failing to encourage amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine or meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users to seek treatment , especially at early stages of use .
such measures may be particularly useful in those countries that have recently seen a growth in the numbers of problem amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine users , especially in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors ( Tal@@ u et al . , 2009 ) .
introduction pro@@ files among cocaine users , assessing the pre@@ val@@ ence of the drug 's use , its health and social consequences and the necessary responses presents a unique set of challenges .
the data available also indicate considerable diversity among cocaine users , both in terms of pat@@ ter@@ ns of use and in terms of soci@@ o@@ demo@@ graph@@ ics .
those who only experim@@ ent with the sub@@ stance on one or a few occasions make up the largest group .
another group includes socially integrated regular users who , in some countries , account for a relatively large number of young people .
some of them will intensify their use of cocaine , or use it over a long period , which may lead to chron@@ ic health and social problems and to the need for treatment .

in 2007 , 2 4@@ 71 cocaine laborat@@ ories were disman@@ tled ( 78 % of the world total ) and a total of 1@@ 44 tonnes of po@@ tas@@ si@@ um perman@@ gan@@ ate was seized in Col@@ om@@ bia ( 94 % of global seiz@@ ures ) ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 9@@ a ) .
competent national authorities are nominated to act as contact points , permanently on @@@ -@@ @ call , in order to rep@@ ly to such requests as soon as possible .
requests may be granted , granted with conditions or refused .
the available information suggests that cocaine continues to be trafficked to Europe via different routes ( E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ d ) .
cocaine con@@ sign@@ ments transit through South and Central American countries , such as Argentina , Brazil , E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , Mexico and Venezuela , before reaching Europe .
Car@@ ib@@ be@@ an countries are also frequently used in the trans@@ hip@@ ment of the drug to Europe .
on these routes , cocaine is smuggled through commercial flights or by sea .
in recent years , an alternative route through West Africa has been identified .
from there , cocaine is often transported to Europe by fishing and sa@@ iling vessels , though trafficking by air or over@@ land through north Africa has also been reported ( Europol , 2007 ) .
other trans@@ iting countries have also been mentioned in recent years .
Belgium , Spain , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Portugal and the United Kingdom have been mentioned as important transit countries for cocaine ship@@ ments inside Europe .
seiz@@ ures quanti@@ ty of cocaine seized and the highest number of seiz@@ ures of the drug - about half of the total - in Europe .
cocaine is the most trafficked drug in the world after her@@ bal can@@ na@@ bis and can@@ na@@ bis res@@ in .
in 2007 , global seiz@@ ures of cocaine remained stable at about 7@@ 10 tonnes .
in Europe , the number of cocaine seiz@@ ures has been on the increase for the last 20 years , and more notably since 2003 .
in 2007 , the number of cocaine seiz@@ ures increased to 92 000 cases , though the total quanti@@ ty recovered dropped to 77 tonnes , down from 121 tonnes in 2006 .
the fall in the total amount of cocaine seized is largely accounted for by Portugal , and to a les@@ ser extent Spain and France , reporting smaller quantities seized in 2007 compared to the previous year ( 90 ) .
for those countries reporting sufficient data to make a comparison , cocaine sold on the street became cheaper between 2002 and 2007 .
these estimates are likely to be conservative .
in countries where amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines dominate the market in illi@@ cit sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs , estimates of cocaine use are low in nearly all cases . Con@@ ver@@ sely , in most countries where cocaine is the main illi@@ cit sti@@ mul@@ ant , low levels of amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine use are reported .
this counter @@@ -@@ @ in@@ tu@@ itive finding could be explained by several factors .
an increase in the supply of cocaine to Europe , reflected in rising vol@@ u@@ mes of seiz@@ ures , is certainly a key factor here .
the search for an alternative to the United States " market , by South American cocaine traffickers , may be a " push " factor driving the increased targeting of the European market .
additionally , a " pull " factor may have been the growing demand for cocaine in Europe .
the increased volume of European cocaine consumption together with the relative strength of European curren@@ cies compared to the US dollar could have compen@@ sa@@ ted for declining prices and , possibly , smaller profit mar@@ g@@ ins .
only a small pro@@ portion of those who have used cocaine at least once in their life appear to develop intensive pat@@ ter@@ ns of use .
data from general population surveys suggest high dis@@ continuation rates among cocaine users .
other factors , however , might also have influenced the price of cocaine .
more competition inside the cocaine market ( Des@@ ro@@ ches , 2007 ) might also have influenced the drug 's price in Europe .
the lack of data in this area makes this analysis necessarily spec@@ ula@@ tive and under@@ lines the importance of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that influence Europe 's drug market .
the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA is committed to continue developing collabor@@ ations and research in this area .
the European average for last year use of cocaine among this age group is estimated at 2.2 % ( 3 million ) and for last month use at 0.@@ 8 % ( 1 million ) .
cocaine use among the general population
overall , cocaine remains the second most used illi@@ cit drug in Europe , after can@@ na@@ bis , though levels of use v@@ ary greatly between countries .
it is estimated that around 13 million Europeans have used it at least once in their lif@@ etime , on average 3.@@ 9 % of adults aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years ( see T@@ able 8 for a sum@@ m@@ ary of the data ) .

chapter 5 : cocaine and cr@@ ack cocaine especially among clients with a primary heroin problem
cr@@ ack cocaine use in Europe
cocaine is available in two forms in Europe : as cocaine pow@@ der ( cocaine H@@ C@@ I , a hydro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide salt ) and the less com@@ mon@@ ly used cr@@ ack cocaine ( a free base ) .
cr@@ ack is typically sm@@ oked , and is known for in@@ ducing an intense " high " that may lead to problematic pat@@ ter@@ ns of use .
in general , it is manufac@@ tured from cocaine H@@ C@@ l in locations close to where it is reta@@ iled and used .
in 2007 , around 8 000 clients are reported to have entered out@@ patient treatment for primary use of cr@@ ack cocaine , representing 15 % of all cocaine clients and 2.7 % of all drug clients in out@@ patient treatment .
almost one quarter ( 22 % ) of primary cr@@ ack clients also use heroin , and these clients report high levels of unemployment and home@@ les@@ s@@ ness ( 1@@ 04 ) .
the use of cr@@ ack started to spread in the United States in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1980s , mainly in de@@ pri@@ ved in@@ ner city sections of metro@@ politan areas , dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately affecting ethnic minorities .
it has been fear@@ ed that a similar phenomenon could happen in Europe but , until now , a serious cr@@ ack ep@@ i@@ demic has not been observed .
cr@@ ack cocaine is , however , used in some European cities , although it is difficult to know the exact size of the phenomenon .
reports on the situation in London ( G@@ L@@ A@@ DA , 2004 ) and Dub@@ lin ( Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly et al . , 2008 ) also suggest that increases can take place .
the first group typically reports s@@ nor@@ ting the drug , and sometimes consum@@ ing it in con@@ jun@@ ction with other substan@@ ces such as alcohol or can@@ na@@ bis , but not with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids . some members of this group are referred to treatment by the criminal justice system .
it includes former heroin users re @@@ -@@ @ entering drug treatment for cocaine use .
siz@@ able cr@@ ack problems have also been reported by cities in other European countries .
among socially integrated individuals , including regular pow@@ der cocaine users , cr@@ ack use is very unusual ( Pr@@ in@@ z@@ le@@ ve et al . , 2004 ) .
nevertheless , the pers@@ istence of cr@@ ack use in some groups and cities under@@ lines the risk of its spread to larger populations .
some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Ireland , Italy , Spain ) , however , have implemented strategies or treatment programmes targeting cocaine users , and France is in the process of developing such programmes .
almost half the cocaine clients start using the drug before the age of 20 , and 88 % before the age of 30 .
Netherlands (
most cocaine clients s@@ nor@@ t ( 55 % ) or smoke ( 32 % ) the drug and less than 7 % report in@@ j@@ ecting it ( 1@@ 02
for this reason , in Ireland out@@ reach work and other interven@@ tions are recommended in order to attract into treatment users who would otherwise not be reached ( Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly et al . , 2008 ) .
out@@ reach treatment programmes can also be beneficial for certain groups .
among them , 42 % also use alcohol , 28 % can@@ na@@ bis and 16 % heroin . cocaine is also often mentioned as a secondary drug ,

see " Cr@@ ack cocaine use in Europe , " and T@@ ables T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 7 and T@@ DI @@@ -@@ @ 115 in the 2009 statistical bul@@ letin .
Germany , Ireland , Austria , the Netherlands , France and Spain estimated that they were available only to a minority of them .
for example , they may not find their needs addressed in treatment services where op@@ i@@ oid users are the main cli@@ en@@ te@@ le . measures to overcome these problems are reported by some countries .
a similar approach is also reported in Ireland , where specific programmes are developed to attract pow@@ der cocaine users .
in the United Kingdom , a clin@@ ical trial is investigating the effectiveness of cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y in con@@ jun@@ ction with contin@@ gency management ( see E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA , 200@@ 8@@ b ) in primary cocaine users .
according to a recent Co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e review , this combination has yi@@ elded the best results for the treatment of sti@@ mul@@ ant dependence ( K@@ n@@ ap@@ p et al . , 2007 ) .
Mo@@ da@@ fin@@ il has already shown ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic potential in several trials as a sub@@ stitute ag@@ ent for sti@@ mul@@ ant dependence .
thus , maintaining regular attendance at ther@@ ap@@ y sessions and mean@@ ing@@ ful ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic dialogue is reported as difficult by professionals ( Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly et al . , 2008 ) .
use of cocaine can also dis@@ rupt treatment for dependence on other drugs and jeopardise successfully achieved abst@@ in@@ ence from heroin .
in Germany for example , con@@ com@@ it@@ ant cocaine use has been identified as a decisive factor in those dropping out of op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment .
it is the largest trial conducted on this vacc@@ ine to date , with several hundred volunteers participating .
these difficulties can be tack@@ led by the development of specific treatment programmes and training courses adap@@ ted to the problems associated with cocaine and cr@@ ack use .
cocaine @@@ -@@ @ specific training for treatment staff is reported from Ireland , Italy and the United Kingdom .
in addition , 11 M@@ ember States , including all those with high levels of cocaine use and treatment demand , report that specific treatment programmes , alongside traditional treatment services , are available for cocaine or cr@@ ack cocaine users .
programmes offer advice and information to young people on the risks associated with alcohol and drug use in general , usually including material on the risks of cocaine use .
however , large seiz@@ ures of op@@ ium and mor@@ ph@@ ine in neighbouring countries ( Pakistan , Iran ) indicate that significant processing is also taking place outside Afghanistan ( CN@@ D , 2008 ; UNODC , 2009 ) .
heroin use , particularly in@@ j@@ ecting the drug , has been closely associated with problem drug use in Europe since the 197@@ 0s .
today , this drug still accounts for the greatest share of mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality related to drug use in the European Union .
a decline in heroin use and associated problems has been observed in the last 10 years , though more recent data suggest that , in some countries , the trend may have changed direction .

the most recent estimate of global potential heroin production is 7@@ 35 tonnes in 2007 ( UNODC , 2009 ) .

heroin prices at different levels of the market
heroin from south @@@ -@@ @ west Asia is also smuggled directly to Europe ( United Kingdom ) by air from Pakistan .
within the European Union , the Netherlands and , to a les@@ ser extent , Belgium play an important role as secondary distribution h@@ ub@@ s ( Europol , 2008 ) .
worldwide reported seiz@@ ures of op@@ ium increased mark@@ edly in 2007 to 5@@ 10 tonnes , with Iran accounting for 84 % of the total .
global reported seiz@@ ures of mor@@ ph@@ ine decreased sharply to 27 tonnes , while global heroin seiz@@ ures increased slightly to 65 tonnes .
the largest seiz@@ ures of heroin were reported by Iran ( 25 % of the world total ) , followed by Turkey and Afghanistan ( UNODC , 2009 ) .
among these countries , the reported who@@ le@@ sale price of heroin ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 12.@@ 5 to EU@@ R 3@@ 5.@@ 8 per gram , and the mean retail price , where available , ran@@ ges from EU@@ R 36 to EU@@ R 6@@ 2.7 .
at both who@@ le@@ sale and retail levels of the market , the lowest prices are reported for Romania and the highest for Spain .
the rati@@ o between retail and who@@ le@@ sale price also var@@ ies considerably , from 1.6 : 1 in the Czech Republic to 2.8 : 1 in the United Kingdom .
possible differences in drug p@@ urity , either between countries , market levels or over time , necess@@ itate caution when making compar@@ is@@ ons .
non@@ e@@ theless , analysis in this area can be in@@ form@@ ative , especially in respect to trends over time as it can point to important changes taking place in the market .
in Europe , an estimated 58 000 seiz@@ ures resulted in the inter@@ cep@@ tion of 22 tonnes of heroin in 2007 .
the United Kingdom continued to report the highest number of seiz@@ ures , while Turkey again reported the greatest quanti@@ ty seized , with 13.@@ 2 tonnes recovered in 2007 ( 1@@ 06 ) .
the overall trend in the quanti@@ ty of heroin inter@@ cep@@ ted in Turkey di@@ ffers from that observed in the European Union .
p@@ urity and price
it is worth noting that many countries report that most " problem op@@ i@@ oid users " could be described as pol@@ y@@ drug users who also use op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .

another indicator of more recent initi@@ ation into in@@ j@@ ecting is the pro@@ portion of young in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors ( under age 25 ) found in samples .
in@@ j@@ ecting drug use is one of the main determin@@ ants of serious public health problems among drug users , including HIV / AIDS , hep@@ ati@@ tis C and over@@ d@@ ose .
the " S@@ elected issue " focuses on the situation and trends of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use and on specific interven@@ tions that target in@@ j@@ ecting drug users in Europe .
the publication also discusses the possible mechanisms behind decreas@@ es of drug in@@ j@@ ecting observed in some countries or regions , and why levels may still be high ( or increasing ) in other regions .
it also discusses interven@@ tions and policies that aim to reduce in@@ j@@ ecting and those that may promote users to adopt less harmful routes of administration .
this " S@@ elected issue " is available in print and on the Internet in English only ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ c@@ d@@ da@@ .@@ eur@@ op@@ a@@ .@@ e@@ u / public@@ ations / selected @@@ -@@ @ issues / in@@ j@@ ecting @@@ -@@ @ drug @@@ -@@ @ use ) from December 2009 .
the lowest propor@@ tions of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among op@@ i@@ oid users entering treatment are reported by Denmark and the Netherlands , and the highest by Lithuania , Latvia and Romania ( 120 ) .
treatment reports also suggest that among op@@ i@@ oid users , the popularity of in@@ j@@ ecting may v@@ ary considerably within countries . for example , in the autonomous communities of Spain the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among new op@@ i@@ oid clients ran@@ ges from 0.@@ 9 % to 47.@@ 2 % .
this is the case in almost all of the 22 reporting countries .
the available estimates suggest large differences between countries in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting drug use .
the lack of data makes drawing conclusions on time trends in the pre@@ val@@ ence of in@@ j@@ ecting difficult , although the available data suggest a stable situation in the Czech

the pro@@ portion of in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors among heroin users entering treatment continued to decrease in 2007 . this trend is now evident in some countries where it had not previously been observed ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Czech Republic , Germany ) .

Com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ty : drug use and mental dis@@ orders
co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty is the often un@@ recognised co @@@ -@@ @ oc@@ curr@@ ence of drug use problems and psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders in the same individual .
O@@ pi@@ oid anal@@ ges@@ ics are the most powerful drugs available for the management of severe and chron@@ ic p@@ ain .
O@@ pi@@ o@@ ids are also used as sub@@ stitution drugs in the management of op@@ i@@ oid dependence .
these drugs , available on pres@@ cri@@ ption , can be mis@@ used and this may lead to adver@@ se health effects such as dependence , over@@ d@@ ose and har@@ ms associated with in@@ j@@ ection .
pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids may enter the illi@@ cit drug market through the di@@ version of sub@@ stitution drugs from their proper use .
internet pharmac@@ ies seem also to play a substantial role in the avail@@ ability of pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids in the United States ( IN@@ C@@ B , 200@@ 9@@ a ) , but their role in Europe appears to be limited .
in Europe , the expansion in the pres@@ cri@@ ption of sub@@ stitution drugs to op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ dependent drug users has been accompanied by increasing reports of the misuse of these drugs .
the mental dis@@ orders most com@@ mon@@ ly reported among drug users in Europe include de@@ pression , anx@@ iety , s@@ chi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia , person@@ ality dis@@ orders , attention deficit and hy@@ per@@ activity .
national experts report that specific programmes exist in 18 countries , but in 14 of these they are available only to a minority of clients in need .
in seven other countries , there are no dedicated programmes at all , but five of them plan to develop such programmes in the next 3 years .
a European prospec@@ tive multi @@@ -@@ @ centre study ( Is@@ ad@@ ora ) has recently been conducted involving dual @@@ -@@ @ diagnos@@ is patients
its findings highlight the difficulties of compar@@ ative analy@@ ses in this area , under@@ lining the need for a more harmon@@ ised approach for diagnos@@ is , treatment and study of co @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty in Europe ( Bal@@ d@@ ac@@ ch@@ ino et al . , 2009 ) .
O@@ pi@@ o@@ ids other than heroin are reported as the primary drug by about 5 % ( 17 8@@ 10 ) of clients entering drug treatment in Europe .
the German P@@ har @@@ -@@ @ M@@ on system , which monitors a wide range of medi@@ c@@ ations that have potential for misuse , also recorded an increase in the misuse of pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , where sub@@ stitution drugs play a more important role than anal@@ ges@@ ics ( Ro@@ es@@ ner and K@@ üf@@ ner , 2007 ) .
in the M@@ ember States that have joined the EU since 2004 are on average younger than their counterparts .
the misuse of pres@@ cri@@ ption op@@ i@@ o@@ ids raises important issues regarding the prevention of di@@ version of sub@@ stitution drugs and op@@ i@@ oid anal@@ ges@@ ics to the illi@@ cit market .
at the same time , care must be taken to ensure that the legitimate use of these substan@@ ces is not com@@ promised ( Ch@@ ern@@ y et al . , 2006 ) .
female drug users are identified as being a particularly vulnerable group .

O@@ pi@@ oid users entering treatment report higher rates of unemployment and lower levels of educational at@@ tain@@ ment than other clients ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
high levels of psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric dis@@ orders are reported in this population ; for example an Italian study found that most ( 72 % ) drug treatment clients with a con@@ com@@ it@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty were primary op@@ i@@ oid users ( 125 ) .
treatment of problem op@@ i@@ oid use
the mean age of clients entering out@@ patient treatment for primary op@@ i@@ oid use is 33 years and almost all countries

drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is a ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic approach , which generally requires individuals to abst@@ ain from all substan@@ ces , including sub@@ stitution medi@@ cation .
especially for younger or first @@@ -@@ @ time clients , or due to difficulties in gaining access to sub@@ stitution treatment .
in Greece for example , the waiting time for op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is on average more than 3 years .
in four countries ( Estonia , Luxembourg , Hungary , Netherlands ) , it is estimated to be provided only to a minority of clients in sub@@ stitution treatment .
according to expert estimates , the avail@@ ability of op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment is relatively high in 16 countries , where it is available to at least half of op@@ i@@ oid users ( see C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
in those countries , drug @@@ -@@ @ free treatment is the treatment of choice for between 10 % and 25 % of op@@ i@@ oid users .
the total number of clients receiving sub@@ stitution treatment in the EU , Croatia and Norway is estimated to be about 650 000 in 2007 , up from 5@@ 60 000 in 2005 and 500 000 in 2003 .
a simple comparison of the estimated number of problem op@@ i@@ oid users and of delivered treat@@ ments suggests that more than 40 % could be receiving sub@@ stitution treatment .
however , there is still a lack of prec@@ ision in both data sets , and this estimate should be viewed with caution .
a set of minimum requirements and international guidelines for psych@@ os@@ o@@ ci@@ ally assisted pharmac@@ ological treatment of persons dependent on op@@ i@@ o@@ ids was recently developed by WHO ( 2009 ) .

treatment of in@@ j@@ ecting drug users with chron@@ ic hep@@ ati@@ tis C
to reduce the burden of hep@@ ati@@ tis C in Europe , it is essential to promote and expand access to treatment for the largest patient group - chron@@ ic carriers of the virus who are active drug in@@ j@@ ec@@ tors .
ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes exist in all EU M@@ ember States , Croatia and Norway .
current treat@@ ments for chron@@ ic hep@@ ati@@ tis C - a 6 to 12 months course of combination ther@@ ap@@ y with long@@ acting inter@@ fer@@ on and ri@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ in - are effective with more than 50 % of patients achieving a sustained vir@@ ological response .
the number of sy@@ r@@ inges provided through ne@@ ed@@ le and sy@@ rin@@ ge programmes increased between 2005 and 2007 in 18 of the 26 countries for which data are available .
access of drug users to hep@@ ati@@ tis C treatment , however , remains low .

during the period 1990 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 , between 6 400 and 8 500 dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths were reported each year by EU M@@ ember States , Croatia , Norway and Turkey , adding up to more than 13@@ 5 000 deaths . in 2006 , the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for half of all reported deaths .
population mortality rates due to dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced death v@@ ary widely between countries , ranging from 3 to over 85 deaths per million population aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 years , with an average of 22 deaths per million in Europe .
rates of over 20 deaths per million are found in 17 out of 30 European countries , and rates of over 40 deaths per million in six countries ( F@@ ig@@ ure 13 ) .
among Europeans aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 39 years , drug over@@ d@@ ose accounted for 4 % of all deaths ( 1@@ 45 ) .
deaths related to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids
O@@ pi@@ o@@ ids , mainly heroin or its met@@ abol@@ ites , are present in the majority of dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced deaths reported in Europe .
in the 22 countries providing data , op@@ i@@ o@@ ids accounted for 35 % to almost 100 % of all cases , with 11 of these countries reporting propor@@ tions of over 85 % ( 14@@ 6 ) .
other substan@@ ces are also found in the to@@ x@@ ic@@ ology reports in addition to heroin .
the most frequently reported are alcohol , benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines , other op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and , in some countries , cocaine .

chapter 8@@ New drugs and emerging trends
during 2008 , 13 new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces were officially noti@@ fied for the first time in the EU through the early @@@ -@@ @ warning system .
besides new syn@@ thetic drugs , which accounted for 11 of the newly noti@@ fied substan@@ ces , the group included two plants , but no medicin@@ al products .
the chemical make @@@ -@@ @ up of the two plants reported - kr@@ atom and kav@@ a - is relatively well known from the literature .
they have been traditionally used in other parts of the world and their presence on the European drug scene seems to be limited .
the use of new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces and new pat@@ ter@@ ns of drug use can have important public health and policy implications .
they are , however , difficult to detec@@ t because , typically , they first emerge at low levels and in specific lo@@ cal@@ ities or among restricted sub@@ groups of the population .
few countries have monitoring systems that are sensitive to new phenom@@ ena in the drug field , and meth@@ od@@ ological difficulties to detec@@ t them are considerable .
non@@ e@@ theless , the importance of identi@@ fying potential new threats is widely recognised .
the European Union 's early @@@ -@@ @ warning system provides a quick @@@ -@@ @ response mechanism to the emer@@ gence of new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces on the drug scene .
most of the newly reported syn@@ thetic compo@@ unds are psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces similar to those listed in sched@@ u@@ les I and II of the 1971 United N@@ ations Convention on psych@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic substan@@ ces .
of the new substan@@ ces reported in 2008 , compared with previous years , fewer belong to the main chemical groups - ph@@ en@@ eth@@ y@@ la@@ mines ( one ) , try@@ p@@ tam@@ ines ( two ) and pi@@ per@@ az@@ ines ( none ) .
notably , six of the newly noti@@ fied substan@@ ces are c@@ ath@@ in@@ one der@@ iv@@ atives .
most of the new syn@@ thetic substan@@ ces have sti@@ mul@@ ant properties , while only three produce hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic effects .
more than 90 substan@@ ces have been reported through the early @@@ -@@ @ warning system since its establishment in 1997 .
until recently , ph@@ en@@ eth@@ y@@ la@@ mines and try@@ p@@ tam@@ ines accounted for a large pro@@ portion of noti@@ fic@@ ations .
however , in the past few years , a much more di@@ verse range of substan@@ ces has appeared .
the appearance of syn@@ thetic can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ ids marks the latest stage in the development of " design@@ er drugs " : from those based on f@@ ent@@ any@@ l in the 1980s ; to ring @@@ -@@ @ sub@@ stitu@@ ted ph@@ en@@ eth@@ y@@ la@@ mines in the late 1980s and try@@ p@@ tam@@ ines in 1990s ; to pi@@ per@@ az@@ ines and c@@ ath@@ in@@ one der@@ iv@@ atives in the 200@@ 0s .
P@@ sy@@ cho@@ active plants reported through the early @@@ -@@ @ warning system
products of five psy@@ cho@@ active plants have been reported in recent years .
the species detec@@ ted by the early @@@ -@@ @ warning system are not under international control , but may be controlled by EU M@@ ember States .
dos@@ es , kr@@ atom has op@@ i@@ oid @@@ -@@ @ like effects , and has been used in traditional medicine to treat p@@ ain and op@@ i@@ oid withdrawal .
the main active principles of kr@@ atom are mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine , mit@@ ra@@ phy@@ l@@ line and 7 @@@ -@@ @ hydro@@ x@@ y@@ mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine ; though mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine is probably responsible for kr@@ atom 's anal@@ ges@@ ic activity and for reli@@ ev@@ ing the op@@ i@@ oid withdrawal symp@@ t@@ oms .
the plant , mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine and 7 @@@ -@@ @ hydro@@ x@@ y@@ mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine are controlled in Denmark , while Lithuania controls the plant and mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ nine .
K@@ ava ( Pip@@ er meth@@ y@@ sti@@ c@@ um ) is a sh@@ ru@@ b that has been used for centuries in the South Pac@@ if@@ ic Is@@ lands for ceremon@@ ial purposes .
a tea bre@@ wed from the roots of the plant can be taken for its anti @@@ -@@ @ anx@@ iety and rela@@ x@@ ant effects .
concern has been growing that long @@@ -@@ @ term use of kav@@ a can cause li@@ ver damage .
neither the plant or its active principles ( kav@@ al@@ ac@@ ton@@ es ) are reported to be controlled in any EU M@@ ember State .
Sal@@ via di@@ vin@@ orum is a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al her@@ b native to southern Mexico , where due to its hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic properties it is traditionally used for ceremon@@ ial purposes .
the main active principle , sal@@ vin@@ or@@ in @@@ -@@ @ A , is a po@@ tent K@@ app@@ a op@@ i@@ oid rec@@ ep@@ tor ag@@ on@@ ist .
rec@@ re@@ ational mo@@ des of use of Sal@@ via include che@@ wing the leaves , and smoking or sub@@ lin@@ gual administration of concentrated extr@@ acts , which appear to produce intense effects .
In@@ ges@@ tion of the leaves or se@@ eds of the plant produces a longer @@@ -@@ @ lasting , but less intense effect .
Sal@@ via di@@ vin@@ orum or its active principles are controlled in six M@@ ember States and Croatia .
K@@ hat is comprised of leaves and fresh sho@@ ots of Cath@@ a ed@@ ul@@ is , a sh@@ ru@@ b cultiv@@ ated in East Africa and the Ara@@ bi@@ an Pen@@ insula .
it is used as a mil@@ d sti@@ mul@@ ant by che@@ wing the fresh veget@@ able matter .
the active components , c@@ ath@@ in@@ one and c@@ ath@@ in , are close chemical relatives of syn@@ thetic drugs such as amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine and meth@@ c@@ ath@@ in@@ one , and are internationally controlled under the 1971 UN Convention .
Cath@@ a ed@@ ul@@ is is controlled in 12 EU M@@ ember States .
Kr@@ atom ( Mit@@ ra@@ gy@@ na speci@@ osa ) is a tree native to southeast Asia .
the leaves can be che@@ wed , sm@@ oked or bre@@ wed into a tea .

early in 2009 , a second syn@@ thetic can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ oid , C@@ P 4@@ 7,@@ 4@@ 97 ( 160 ) , and three of its hom@@ olo@@ gues were detec@@ ted in " sp@@ ice " samples in Europe .
syn@@ thetic can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ ids have been identified only in a limited number of samples , and in var@@ ying amounts .

Pack@@ aging information on " sp@@ ice " products indicates that they are composed of as many as 14 ing@@ redi@@ ents of plant origin .
while at least two of the ing@@ redi@@ ents - P@@ edi@@ cul@@ ar@@ is den@@ si@@ fl@@ ora and Leon@@ otis le@@ onur@@ us - may have some psy@@ cho@@ active effect , little is known about the pharmac@@ ology and to@@ x@@ ic@@ ology of the plant materials pur@@ por@@ tedly contained in " sp@@ ice " products .
thus , no defin@@ ite statements can be made as to the potential health risks or possible psy@@ cho@@ active effects of these products .

the online market@@ place has implications for the potential spread of new psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces , and monitoring it is an increasingly important element of identi@@ fying new drug trends .
in particular , it is necessary to focus on the risks associated with the substan@@ ces offered for sale .
information about new products is needed by both the users and professionals , including clin@@ ical to@@ x@@ ic@@ ologists , po@@ ison control specialists and those working in the drugs field .
across the 26 countries studied , three distinc@@ t approaches to risk assessment are apparent .
in six countries , national risk assessment is not carried out .
generally , these countries rely on risk assessments carried out at international or European level .
in seven countries , national risk assessment may be carried out on an ad @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ c basis , when necessary .
to identify current developments in the online drug market , the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA conduc@@ ts an annual sn@@ ap@@ shot study .
in 2009 , a total of 115 online shops were surveyed .
based on the country code dom@@ ain@@ s and other information on the websites , these online shops appear to be located in 17 European countries .
the majority of online retailers identified were based in the United Kingdom ( 37 % ) , Germany ( 15 % ) , Netherlands ( 14 % ) and Romania ( 7 % ) .
Hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic mus@@ h@@ rooms containing p@@ sil@@ oc@@ in and p@@ sil@@ oc@@ y@@ bin were not offered for sale in any of the online shops surveyed in 2009 , unlike 2008 .

six countries do or might provide for the possibility of consultation with independent scientists , if a need is perceived .
and , in three countries ( Netherlands , Austria , United Kingdom ) , risk assessment is performed by independent scientific bodies .
new products offered for sale in 2009 include a range of her@@ bal smoking products and " party pil@@ ls " containing new legal alternatives to benz@@ yl@@ pi@@ per@@ az@@ ine ( B@@ Z@@ P ) .
there has also been an increasing focus on sn@@ uf@@ f products or her@@ bal pow@@ ders .

" sp@@ ice " products ( 16@@ 1 ) were offered for sale by 48 % of the retailers surveyed .
concern about " sp@@ ice " products has led to a number of countries taking legal action to ban or otherwise control these substan@@ ces .
by March 2009 , " sp@@ ice " products had been withdrawn from online shops based in Germany , Austria and France .
Austria used its medicin@@ es act to prohibi@@ t smoking mi@@ x@@ es containing six syn@@ thetic can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ ids from being imported or mar@@ ke@@ ted in the country .

changes in the situation are difficult to assess due to pre@@ val@@ ence data being obtained from non @@@ -@@ @ prob@@ abil@@ istic samples with limited compar@@ ability over time and between samples .

drugs and crime - a complex relationship
en C of drug use and problem drug users are frequently found to be offen@@ ders .
however , the relationship between drugs and crime is neither simple nor lin@@ e@@ ar .
nor is it universal : many repeat offen@@ ders are not involved in drug use and many dependent drug users do not commit any crimes ( other than drug use / possession , where it is crimin@@ alised ) .
demonstration of wealth and status .
and some may go on to become more regular or dependent drug users , which can in turn lead to their increased involvement in crime or the drug market .
however , a necessary prerequisite to discussion on the extent of this problem and for considering the impact of interven@@ tions is an agreed concep@@ tual framework for describing the problem .
this is also recognised in the current EU drugs action plan ( 2005 @@@ -@@ @ 08 ) , where the development of a common defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime is an exp@@ li@@ cit action .
in this policy brief@@ ing the different types of offences that might be en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ed under a general heading of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime are explo@@ red .
although studies do not show any strong link between experim@@ ental drug use and off@@ ending , they do tend to show that de@@ lin@@ qu@@ ency often prece@@ des involvement with illi@@ cit drugs .
this is especially true for those drugs particularly associated with dependence and problems , such as heroin or cr@@ ack cocaine .
Studies have also shown that dependent drug users may commit acquis@@ itive crimes as a means of supporting their drug habi@@ ts .
for the career criminal , drugs may form part of the dev@@ i@@ ant lif@@ estyle , with spending on drugs being a
Studies have revealed various risk factors ( some common , some not ) for involvement in off@@ ending and in drug use .
the term " dru@@ g@@ related crime " is used here to en@@ comp@@ ass four types of crimes .
system@@ ic crimes : crimes committed within the functioning of illi@@ cit drug markets , as part of the business of drug supply , distribution and use .
drug law offences : crimes committed in violation of drug ( and other related ) legisla@@ tions .
key issues at a g@@ lance
defining drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime to assess its extent and pat@@ ter@@ ns
a defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime
" the need to reduce drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime is now recognised as an important policy objective in Europe .
Mar@@ cel Re@@ i@@ men , Chairman , E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA Management Board psy@@ cho@@ tic ep@@ iso@@ des of behaviour and may well exac@@ er@@ b@@ ate existing behavi@@ our@@ al problems .
that said , no psy@@ cho@@ active sub@@ stance can be said to have universal crimin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic properties and both individual and environmental factors can influence how the use of psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces imp@@ acts on behaviour .
the effects of such drugs include exc@@ it@@ ability , ir@@ rit@@ ability , fear / par@@ ano@@ ia , dis@@ in@@ hibition , dras@@ tic mood sw@@ ings , cogn@@ itive dist@@ or@@ tions and imp@@ aired jud@@ gement , any of which may lead to criminal behaviour .
it is also important to include in this category crimes indu@@ ced by the victim 's own drug use . such crimes are less visible , because many go un@@ reported .
however , such a defin@@ ition of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime is essential to any attempt to assess its extent , pat@@ ter@@ ns and trends .
in practice , each model is sometimes valid and can be applied to some sub@@ groups of the population of drug @@@ -@@ @ using offen@@ ders or to some types of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
it is important to remember that the relationship between drugs and crime can be a dynamic one and may v@@ ary even in the same person over time .
dependence on an expensive sub@@ stance can lead users to engage in criminal acts to obtain the money they use to fund their drug ha@@ bit .
they may resort to both consen@@ su@@ al crimes , such as drug selling or prostitution ( where crimin@@ alised ) , and acquis@@ itive crimes ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . shop@@ lifting , rob@@ bery , bur@@ g@@ lary ) .
such offen@@ ders are sometimes paid in drugs .
this category of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime also includes the for@@ ging of pres@@ crip@@ tions and the bur@@ gling of pharmac@@ ies by drug users , both of which provide medicin@@ es that can be used as sub@@ stitu@@ tes for illi@@ cit products .
much of the existing research supports the view that there is a strong association between alcohol in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ation and psych@@ op@@ harmac@@ olog@@ ically indu@@ ced crime , especially violence .
following a long way behind alcohol in this regard are the sti@@ mul@@ ants - cocaine / cr@@ ack and amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines .
the use of op@@ i@@ ates and can@@ na@@ bis is usually considered to be unlikely to lead to psych@@ op@@ harmac@@ olog@@ ically indu@@ ced crime , and may even contribute to reducing it in some individuals , as these drugs ( and tran@@ qu@@ il@@ lis@@ ers ) tend to reduce violent imp@@ ul@@ ses and aggres@@ sion .
however , ir@@ rit@@ ability associated with the withdrawal syn@@ dro@@ me , as well as related mental health problems , may be linked to increased violence .
although many acquis@@ itive crimes committed by drug users are opportun@@ istic , some require more sk@@ ill and others involve some speci@@ alisation .
for example , fraud and embezz@@ lement are white @@@ -@@ @ col@@ lar crimes that require a specific professional environment .
while the pharmac@@ ology of most illi@@ cit drugs is well known , the specific mechanisms through which they promote violent behavi@@ ours are not fully understood although some substan@@ ces , usually sti@@ mul@@ ants , are known to produce
an increasingly common approach in emp@@ iri@@ cal studies has been to apply the tripartite concep@@ tual framework proposed by Gol@@ d@@ stein for the relationship between drugs and crime .
in this model , drugs lead to violence through an integration of the psych@@ op@@ harmac@@ ological , econom@@ ic@@ comp@@ ul@@ sive and system@@ ic models .
although it may not en@@ comp@@ ass all the possible relationships between drugs and crime , this approach does provide a useful concep@@ tual framework for the analysis of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
additionally , from a policy perspective , it is hel@@ p@@ ful to include a legal defin@@ ition model , in which crimes against drug laws are considered to be another type of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
the resulting concep@@ tual model , composed of four categories of drug crimes , is the basis for the defin@@ ition of the term " dru@@ g@@ related crime " used here , the individual components of which are discussed below .
drug law offences
many studies have been carried out on the links between drug use / tra@@ ff@@ i cking and crime , mostly in the United States .
those whose drug use needs to be supported by illegal income , which will be determined by their type and pat@@ tern of sub@@ stance use , soci@@ o@@ economic situation and extent of dev@@ i@@ ant lif@@ estyle .
many drug users u@@ til@@ ise a combination of all these means .
however , some studies have attempted to estimate the pro@@ portion of different types of off@@ ence that are drug @@@ -@@ @ related and then apply this frac@@ tion to produce overall estimates of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime .
system@@ ic crimin@@ ality ref@@ ers mainly to violent acts ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . assa@@ ults , hom@@ ic@@ ides ) committed within the functioning of illi@@ cit drug markets , as part of the business of drug supply , distribution and use .
violence as a strategy of control is used in various situations including territorial disputes , punishment for fraud , debt collection and clashes with the police .
in drug production and transit countries where the rule of law is challenged , system@@ ic crimes may also en@@ comp@@ ass , for example , corruption of businesses , governments and banking systems or crimes against humanity by drug traffic@@ ker@@ s@@ . c@@ kers .
Studies of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime have often over@@ looked drug law offences as the link between drugs and crime is of a very different nature - in this case drugs and crime are linked by defin@@ ition in the law , rather than by any effect of one behaviour on the other .
in addition , drug law offences account for a substantial share of law enforcement and criminal justice system activities and resources .
system@@ ic violence is linked to prohibi@@ tion as it stems mainly from the illi@@ cit nature of a market characterised by huge profits and whose participants can@@ not resort to standard business law .
however , the perv@@ asi@@ veness of violence in drug markets may increase the lik@@ elihood of drug users becoming perpetrators or victims of violent crimes .
the four categories of drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime suggested , and the models on which they are der@@ ived , are not mutually exclusive .
rather , the categor@@ isation should be considered to demonstrate " ideal types " that allow drug @@@ -@@ @ related crime to be concep@@ tu@@ alised and facilitate compar@@ is@@ ons .
indeed , from an economic perspective , which views crime as a reaction to prices and incentives , any increase in the pro@@ portion of available resources allocated to the enforcement of drug laws would reduce the resources allocated to other crimes .
this would make such crimes relatively less costly ( through reduced prob@@ ability of arrest and shor@@ tened inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ation ) and therefore may increase their inci@@ dence .

an estimated 12 million ( 3.5 % ) European adults aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 have tried cocaine and 4.5 million ( 1.3 % ) have used it in the last year .
overall , cocaine supply , use and related problems in Europe have risen over the last decade , and prices have dropped .
however , this overall trend mas@@ ks considerable inter @@@ -@@ @ country vari@@ ation .
this paper addresses a number of important issues for the delivery of services for cocaine users .
how can the different groups of users be reached and helped ?
what type of treatment should be made available for dependent cocaine users ?
are new specialised services needed , or should existing ones be adap@@ ted ?

cocaine is the hydro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide salt produced from the leaves of the co@@ ca plant ( Er@@ y@@ thro@@ x@@ yl@@ on co@@ ca lam ) which is cultiv@@ ated mainly in South America .
pow@@ der cocaine is typically s@@ nor@@ ted ( in@@ su@@ ff@@ lated ) and , less frequently , in@@ j@@ ected .
it produces e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia and appe@@ ti@@ te sup@@ pression , and has multiple negative effects on health ( see " Health issues " ) .
cr@@ ack is the smok@@ able form of cocaine and is manufac@@ tured from cocaine hydro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide .
it is known for immediate effects and association with problematic pat@@ ter@@ ns of use .
key issues at a g@@ lance
some 4.5 million European adults ( 1.3 % ) have used cocaine in the last year .
last year cocaine pre@@ val@@ ence has shown an overall up@@ ward trend over the last decade , although with vari@@ ations between EU M@@ ember States , ranging from 0.@@ 1 % to 3.@@ 0 % of the population .
cocaine use can lead to dependence and treatment demand related to cocaine has increased .
psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric , cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular and other health problems are also associated with cocaine use .
in@@ j@@ ecting cocaine carries the risk of transmission of blood @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ ne diseases such as HIV and hep@@ ati@@ tis C.
three core groups of problem cocaine users can be identified : socially well @@@ -@@ @ integrated individuals ; op@@ i@@ oid users , some of whom are sub@@ stitution treatment clients ; and margin@@ alised cr@@ ack users .

second only to can@@ na@@ bis , cocaine is among the most trafficked drugs in the world .
in 2005 , an estimated 7@@ 52 tonnes were seized worldwide and 1@@ 07 tonnes in Europe , with Spain accounting for about half of European seiz@@ ures .
overall , the quantities seized and the number of seiz@@ ures have increased in Europe since 2000 , reaching around 70 000 cases in 2005 .
average prices of cocaine have fallen in most reporting countries .

General population surveys show an increase in cocaine use in many EU countries , although this may now be slow@@ ing down in some M@@ ember States with the highest pre@@ val@@ ence ( UK , Spain ) .
cocaine use is more common among young adults aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 34 ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) and mal@@ es .
the drug is often consu@@ med alongside other illi@@ cit drugs and alcohol .
ac@@ ute and chron@@ ic cocaine use , often in combination with other substan@@ ces , can cause multiple dis@@ orders ( cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular , ne@@ ur@@ ological , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric , et@@ c . ) .
most reported cocaine deaths are the consequence of its chron@@ ic to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity , leading to cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular and ne@@ ur@@ ological complic@@ ations .
cocaine use has been shown to have negative effects on health , especially among frequent users .
however , the extent of both the mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality related directly to cocaine use remains difficult to estimate .
the first group uses pow@@ der cocaine alone or in combination with can@@ na@@ bis and / or alcohol .
this group is mainly composed of mal@@ es , often referred to treatment by the criminal justice system or under the pressure of social and family networks .
different groups of users
cocaine users are spread across di@@ verse social groups .
for example , surveys in rec@@ re@@ ational night@@ life sett@@ ings show pre@@ val@@ ence rates 5 to 20 times higher among clu@@ b@@ bers than among
the second group uses both op@@ i@@ o@@ ids and cocaine .

cocaine and cr@@ ack act on the reward system of the brain and repeated use can lead to dependence .
it is the third most com@@ mon@@ ly reported drug cited as the reason for entering drug treatment in the EU , with about 13 % of all treatment demands in 2005 .
however , there are considerable vari@@ ations between countries .
in Spain and the Netherlands , cocaine accounts for respectively 40 % and 35 % of all treatment demands while this figure is 0 % in Finland and 0.@@ 1 % in Lithuania .
the number of treatment demands related to cocaine use has increased in recent years , notably among those entering treatment for the first time ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .

problems and are difficult to reach .
they might seek treatment and support at a later stage of their dependence and thus be more difficult to treat .
undergoing sub@@ stitution treatment . national studies focusing on cocaine users in treatment report that this group is often the largest .
the way forward
policies and interven@@ tions
outside such locations , drug policies should address the growing diversity in drug use pat@@ ter@@ ns and needs of problem drug users .
the third group uses cr@@ ack cocaine , often in combination with op@@ i@@ o@@ ids .
its members are frequently highly margin@@ alised , and may comp@@ rise a high pro@@ portion of ethnic minority members and people who are home@@ less , unemployed or in prec@@ ar@@ ious labour conditions .
it is the smal@@ lest of the three groups ( 2.5 % of all European clients in treatment ) and has only been identified in a few locations .
the needs of different us@@ er groups
there are very few drug strategies which specifically target cocaine and cr@@ ack cocaine use and only the UK and Ireland have implemented strategies at national and / or local level .
most European countries report that cocaine users can access information about cocaine and the risks of cocaine use through various sources such as websites , hel@@ pl@@ ines and interven@@ tions in the night@@ life setting .
in some cities , especially those with significant cr@@ ack cocaine use , harm @@@ -@@ @ reduction agencies also provide out@@ reach interven@@ tions .
cocaine and cr@@ ack users represent a het@@ ero@@ gen@@ e@@ ous population with specific needs which may require ta@@ il@@ ored services .
socially integrated pow@@ der cocaine users may need to be better informed about cocaine @@@ -@@ @ related risks .
they may also be reluctant to initiate or continue treatment among margin@@ alised drug users and feel there is a sti@@ g@@ ma att@@ ached to users attending such services .
currently , most reported cocaine treatment in Europe takes place in out@@ patient sett@@ ings which are primarily oriented to the needs of op@@ i@@ oid users .
however , socially integrated cocaine users are likely to seek help through other healthcare providers such as general practi@@ tion@@ ers or private clinics .
there is a growing interest for countries with significant co@@ c@@ ain@@ e@@ using populations to provide services ta@@ il@@ ored specifically to cocaine users .
the treatment of cocaine dependence reli@@ es mainly on psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial interven@@ tions , with pharmac@@ ological agents being used as a support by many clin@@ ic@@ ians .
however , until now , no effective pharmac@@ ological ag@@ ent has emerged to manage cocaine abst@@ in@@ ence and reduce cra@@ ving .
therefore , research and training in psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial interven@@ tions should be given highest priority .
the exchange of experiences and best practice among clin@@ ic@@ ians should be encouraged .
research on pharmaceutical agents should also be supported and the results made rapidly available , both for positive as well as negative out@@ comes .
finally , cocaine users who are undergoing op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment should be assessed to make sure that their cocaine use is not linked with too low a dos@@ age of meth@@ ad@@ one or bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine .
the co @@@ -@@ @ use of multiple substan@@ ces also substan@@ tially increases the risk of additional health problems and the risk of death among this population .
finally , cr@@ ack cocaine often affects margin@@ alised and de@@ pri@@ ved populations ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . the home@@ less , sex workers ) .
however , as these approaches and the research about their effectiveness come almost exclusively from the
interven@@ tions to reach socially integrated problem cocaine users and margin@@ alised cr@@ ack users also pose a challenge .
for cr@@ ack users and margin@@ alised populations of drug users , harm reduction out@@ reach interven@@ tions , combined with service refer@@ r@@ al , need to be given higher priority .
drugs in focus
brief@@ ing of the European Monitoring
centre for Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction
drug addi@@ ction is a behaviour characterised by the individual exhibi@@ ting a loss of control over their consumption . ad@@ dicts may wish to stop , but find it difficult to do so , despite often experiencing negative consequences .
modern developments in ne@@ ur@@ o@@ bi@@ ology help us to better understand this process .
most ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research on addi@@ ction has focused on the role a drug @@@ -@@ @ released ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter called dop@@ am@@ ine has on the repeated activ@@ ation of the " reward system " - cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry made up of a complex set of cer@@ e@@ br@@ al structures which act as a baro@@ meter , indicating a person 's physical and psychological state .
sp@@ urred on by recent technological developments oc@@ curr@@ ing rapidly in this field , new@@ models have ar@@ isen which take into account the implic@@ ation of other ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters in the process , also expl@@ oring the role of gen@@ etic differences between individuals .
N@@ euro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter : a chemical produced and released by ne@@ ur@@ ons .
some of these mo@@ lec@@ u@@ les ( G@@ AB@@ A , gl@@ ut@@ am@@ ic ac@@ id ) participate in the communication between ne@@ ur@@ ons ; some others ( dop@@ am@@ ine , nor@@ ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) mo@@ du@@ late ( amp@@ lif@@ y or atten@@ u@@ ate ) the information .
reward system : this brain cir@@ cu@@ it rein@@ forces behaviour when activ@@ ated .
data indicate that drugs of abuse are pleas@@ ur@@ able because they activ@@ ate this system .
N@@ euro@@ biological research tries to understand how ad@@ dic@@ tive drugs produce ne@@ ur@@ o@@ chemical changes in the brain 's reward path@@ way , making their use appe@@ aling and producing a drive to use them repeatedly .
a growing body of research suggests that chron@@ ic drug use can produce long @@@ -@@ @ term dis@@ rup@@ tions in the mo@@ du@@ lation of ne@@ ur@@ o@@ cogn@@ itive cir@@ cu@@ its involved in motiv@@ ation and attention , decision @@@ -@@ @ making and the ability to in@@ hibi@@ t imp@@ ul@@ ses .
N@@ eur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence and gen@@ etic research promise to provide a detailed ca@@ usal explanation in terms of brain processes .
1st issue 2009
N@@ euro@@ biological research in addi@@ ction and that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse dis@@ rup@@ ts this regulation .
over time , nor@@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gic and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ er@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons become autonomous and hy@@ per @@@ -@@ @ reac@@ tive to external sti@@ mul@@ i and arguably this dru@@ g@@ indu@@ ced long @@@ -@@ @ term un@@ cou@@ pling explains dys@@ functions in motiv@@ ation and in the ability to in@@ hibi@@ t imp@@ ul@@ ses .
" developments in ne@@ ur@@ os@@ ci@@ ence are trans@@ forming our understanding of how people become ad@@ dic@@ ted to drugs while opening @@@ -@@ @ up av@@ en@@ ues of investigation for new approaches to treatment .
we must , however , ensure that such beneficial new approaches are rigor@@ ously evalu@@ ated prior to implementation to ensure maximum success and financial efficiency . "
almost all drugs known to indu@@ ce abuse or addi@@ ction in hum@@ ans increase the release of a ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter called dop@@ am@@ ine in a sub @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ tical structure , the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us acc@@ umb@@ ens .
the cell bodies of ne@@ ur@@ ons which release dop@@ am@@ ine are located in the ven@@ tral te@@ g@@ mental area and the substan@@ tia n@@ ig@@ ra ( see figure ) .
these dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons form the me@@ so @@@ -@@ @ cor@@ tic@@ ol@@ im@@ bic path@@ way .
they stimulate different cer@@ e@@ br@@ al structures , such as the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ te@@ x , the am@@ y@@ g@@ dal@@ a and the hip@@ po@@ camp@@ us , which are part of a cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry called the " reward system . "
animal studies and other evidence suggest great vari@@ ability in vulner@@ ability to addi@@ ction .
new technologies mean that ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research can start to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological and gen@@ etic differences in individuals that may influence their chances of developing addi@@ ction if they use drugs .
new technologies in addi@@ ction research non @@@ -@@ @ inv@@ asive techniques which may help to identify ne@@ ur@@ op@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological deficits that may be the primary source of an individual 's in@@ ability to stop using drugs .
traditional and new@@ treat@@ ments of addi@@ ction
this dys@@ regulation would correspon@@ d either to an increased reac@@ tivity of dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons to specific sti@@ mul@@ i linked to the pleas@@ ur@@ able and ad@@ dic@@ tive product or to a down @@@ -@@ @ regulation of dop@@ am@@ ine sign@@ al@@ ling and a dam@@ pen@@ ing of activity in the reward path@@ way .
in natural situations , dop@@ am@@ ine is released when a re@@ war@@ ding experience is new , better than expected or un@@ anticipated .
this release of dop@@ am@@ ine helps the individual to memor@@ ise signals announcing a reward .
New@@ models in th@@ en@@ euro@@ bi@@ ology of addi@@ ction
in hum@@ ans , gen@@ etic studies have tried to identify specific addi@@ ction sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility gen@@ es .
addi@@ ction has traditionally been treated by a combination of pharmac@@ ological and psych@@ os@@ o@@ cial treat@@ ments .
Nic@@ o@@ tine replacement ther@@ ap@@ y is a common form of sub@@ stitution treatment for sm@@ oked tobacco but is not particularly effective .
some treat@@ ments may also be used for a short period to help w@@ ean individuals off all drugs .
P@@ sy@@ ch@@ os@@ o@@ cial interven@@ tions include cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y , motiv@@ ational inter@@ viewing , drug coun@@ selling or 12 @@@ -@@ @ step support groups .
these ther@@ ap@@ ies provide an important ad@@ jun@@ ct to pharmac@@ ological and medical treat@@ ments in achieving a long @@@ -@@ @ term successful outcome .
some recent studies suggest that , despite the critical and un@@ questionable role dop@@ am@@ ine plays in reward , drugs of abuse may not necessarily indu@@ ce addi@@ ction via a direct effect on dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons .
there is some evidence that dop@@ am@@ ine acts down@@ stream to two other ne@@ ur@@ omo@@ du@@ la@@ tors , nor@@ ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , responsible for vig@@ il@@ ance and for the control of imp@@ ul@@ si@@ vity , respectively .
animal studies indicate that nor@@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gic and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ er@@ gic ne@@ ur@@ ons are coup@@ led ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . limit the activity of each other )
progress in ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research on addi@@ ction has led to the use of drugs which target the dop@@ am@@ iner@@ gic system . however , this strategy has not yet proven effective in
ca@@ usal models of addi@@ ction tre@@ ating addi@@ ction , possibly because the wrong dop@@ am@@ ine rec@@ ep@@ tor has been targeted ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . D@@ 2 ) or because other mo@@ du@@ lat@@ ory ne@@ ur@@ o@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter systems also require consideration .
cho@@ ices or act upon them . drug use en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es a complex set of behavi@@ ours and even the autonomy of dependent individuals is vari@@ able .
ethical and policy@@ implications
how addi@@ ction is understood by society is important for deciding which responses are appropriate .
even today , some authors remain sceptical about the existence of addi@@ ction , and the extent to which dependent individuals have autonomy over their actions remains a question of fundamental importance .
a number of other novel treatment approaches are in development or are being resear@@ ched which may provide new approaches to tre@@ ating some forms of drug dependence .
N@@ eur@@ os@@ ur@@ gery is the most inv@@ asive and permanent form of experim@@ ental treatment , but there exist strong ethical objections to this approach .
a less inv@@ asive approach is trans@@ cr@@ an@@ ial mag@@ ne@@ tic stimu@@ lation that involves placing a small mag@@ ne@@ tic co@@ il against an individual 's s@@ kul@@ l in order to block or enhance ne@@ ural activity .
D@@ op@@ am@@ iner@@ gic projections from mid@@ brain to fore@@ brain
projections from the mid@@ brain also make connections with the cau@@ date and the p@@ ut@@ amen ( la@@ bel@@ led Stri@@ at@@ um in the figure ) . source : Hy@@ man et al . , 2006 .
N@@ euro@@ biological research can make a significant contribution to our understanding of the extent to which ad@@ dicts are autonomous , and therefore responsible for their actions .
the autonomy of ad@@ dicts in making cho@@ ices about their drug use is und@@ oub@@ tedly imp@@ aired when they are ac@@ utely in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ated or experiencing severe withdrawal symp@@ t@@ oms .
if ne@@ ur@@ o@@ biological research leads to the development of new treatment approaches , they will join and hop@@ efully comple@@ ment existing treat@@ ments .
patients will need to be given information on different treatment options , and the costs and benefits of any new ther@@ ap@@ y should be carefully considered along with its potential e@@ ffic@@ acy .
treat@@ ments that are inv@@ asive or dangerous are difficult to justify if safer options already exist .
a generally accepted ethical principle is that care available in prison sett@@ ings should be equivalent to that available to the wider community .
ethical concerns would arise if new ther@@ ap@@ ies were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately targeted on those in custody and other treat@@ ments of proven e@@ ffic@@ acy denied .

N@@ euro@@ biological research provides support for a " medical model " of addi@@ ction .
new meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies such as ne@@ ur@@ o@@ im@@ aging and gen@@ etic research may help to better understand vari@@ ations in vulner@@ ability to addi@@ ction , even if social factors are also clearly important .
however , the extent to which this can be used in practice remains questionable .

responding to drug driving in Europe
until then , this policy brief@@ ing sum@@ mar@@ ises the key issues facing policymakers and describes developments across Europe that may assist decision @@@ -@@ @ making on the topic .
and benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines are generally imp@@ air@@ ing ; of the op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , heroin can imp@@ air severely , meth@@ ad@@ one less so , and bu@@ pren@@ or@@ ph@@ ine even less .
the data for sti@@ mul@@ ant drugs such as cocaine , amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines and ec@@ st@@ asy are more mixed , but suggest that high dos@@ es are associated with imp@@ air@@ ment .
yet , an objective measure for imp@@ air@@ ment for each drug , similar to the blood alcohol concentration , remains elu@@ sive .
reducing the loss of life caused by driving under the influence of psy@@ cho@@ active substan@@ ces requires measures that are based on a scientific understanding of this complex phenomenon .
the challenge to legisla@@ tors is to design sound and effective laws that can be enforced , and that give a clear message to the public .
alcohol alone is estimated to account for up to 10 000 road deaths a year in the European Union , one quarter of all road deaths .
no compar@@ able figures are available for road accidents related to illi@@ cit drugs and psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es , though these have been receiving increasing attention over the past decade .
the latest research suggests that can@@ na@@ bis can reduce performance
D@@ R@@ U@@ ID aims to provide a solid basis for harmon@@ ised , EU @@@ -@@ @ wide regulations for driving under the influence of alcohol , drugs and medicine .
defin@@ ition
reports of drug driving incidents often receive much media
various psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es , which might or might not be legally pres@@ cri@@ bed and consu@@ med , can imp@@ air driving skills .
but , few countries have reliable statistics on the pre@@ val@@ ence of driving under the influence of drugs .
obtaining sound scientific evidence on behavi@@ our@@ al effects ,
currently , police experience considerable difficulty with the accur@@ ate and rapid identification of drug driving at the road@@ side .
pre@@ val@@ ence and accident risk is difficult with the available data .
many of the studies have small samples and it is often difficult to general@@ ise from their results .
key audiences may not be hearing the message , or they may be ignoring it .
reflecting the scientific debate about the precise effects of the substan@@ ces , the legal defin@@ ition of the off@@ ence of driving under the influence of drugs di@@ ffers among EU M@@ ember States .
extent of drug driving is not studied in many European countries
the number of people samp@@ led has ran@@ ged from under 50 to over 10 000 , with more than one third of the studies reporting on fewer than 500 individuals .
Studies on drug pre@@ val@@ ence in drivers published between 1999 and 2007 provide data for only 13 of the 27 EU M@@ ember States and Norway .
medicin@@ es and illi@@ cit drugs , others do .
in Finland and Sweden , new zero @@@ -@@ @ tolerance laws for illi@@ cit drugs were passed following the experience that the off@@ ence of imp@@ aired driving was extremely difficult to prove .
in Cyprus , this problem is addressed by prosecut@@ ing such drivers for illegal consumption of drugs .
however , Belgium and the United Kingdom specifically prohibi@@ t use of a test result for drug driving as evidence for any other off@@ ence .
national legislation or policies may also limit the scope and compar@@ ability of pre@@ val@@ ence studies .
for example , ran@@ dom road@@ side tests for drugs are not per@@ mitted in most countries .
in some countries , tests are only carried out for illi@@ cit drugs , and the pre@@ val@@ ence of psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es can@@ not be as@@ cer@@ tained .
ran@@ dom road@@ side surveys of drivers , which can give a representative picture of the entire driving population , are available for three EU M@@ ember States and Norway .
other surveys provide data on drug use among specific sub@@ sets of drivers .
however , the results of these various studies are not scienti@@ fic@@ ally compar@@ able .
a positive test for alcohol may over@@ ride any requirement for drug testing , with resource limit@@ ations and prosecution requirements taking priority over any need for comprehensive data gathering .
this has been the case in Denmark , Estonia , Ireland and Portugal .
evidence of drug @@@ -@@ @ taking may be detec@@ ted in different biological samples , including blood , ur@@ ine , sal@@ i@@ va , swe@@ at and even ha@@ ir .
blood is the ideal mat@@ ri@@ x for legal proof of imp@@ air@@ ment , but road@@ side screening by oral f@@ lu@@ id ( sal@@ i@@ va ) is desi@@ ra@@ ble for conven@@ i@@ ence .
threshold levels for the drugs may be set at the lower limit of detection , or at levels where imp@@ air@@ ment may be expected to start .
however , while some drugs , including can@@ na@@ bis and op@@ i@@ o@@ ids , appear to have a dos@@ e@@ dependent imp@@ air@@ ing effect , others such as amp@@ het@@ am@@ ines do not .
tolerance and inter@@ actions with alcohol or other drugs complic@@ ate calc@@ ulations further .
in France , drivers found combin@@ ing drugs with alcohol receive a higher penalty .
responding to psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es
generally , can@@ na@@ bis is the most common illi@@ cit sub@@ stance detec@@ ted , and benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines are the most com@@ mon@@ ly reported psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es .
new international gu@@ idance for stand@@ ardis@@ ation of study design@@ s have been drawn up with the assistance of the E@@ MC@@ D@@ DA and the European Commission 's D@@ G Transport .
where to draw the line - or lines ?
barriers to building up scientific evidence
P@@ sy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es , such as pain@@ kil@@ lers ( op@@ i@@ o@@ ids ) , sed@@ atives ( benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines ) , anti@@ de@@ pres@@ san@@ ts and anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can have sometimes considerable effects on the capabilities of drivers .
results from studies suggest that drivers may be using these drugs either for medical reasons following pres@@ cri@@ ption , or mis@@ using them , sometimes together with illi@@ cit substan@@ ces .
concern is also growing about the possible impact of the increasing numbers of drug users receiving op@@ i@@ oid sub@@ stitution treatment .
most European countries take one of two approaches to defining the off@@ ence of driving under the influence of drugs .
eleven countries only pen@@ alise imp@@ aired driving , whether caused by illi@@ cit drugs or medicin@@ es .
eleven other countries have adopted a " zero @@@ -@@ @ tolerance " policy , pen@@ alising any driving after drug @@@ -@@ @ taking .
in seven countries , these two approaches are combined in a ti@@ ered response to drug driving offen@@ ders .
most countries " laws pen@@ alise imp@@ air@@ ment from any drug , whether illi@@ cit or medicin@@ al .
in France , Austria and Portugal , some imp@@ air@@ ing psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es such as benz@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines are not covered by the drug driving law , though they may be
more than 30 studies on the pre@@ val@@ ence of drugs among drivers have been carried out across Europe since 1999 .
however , these studies have used various methods and samp@@ led different groups of drivers , making it difficult to draw overall conclusions .
in the EU , while France uses road@@ side sal@@ i@@ va tests , prosecution is based on the results of a blood test .
these tests may include , for example , exam@@ ination of the size of the pupils , Co@@ ordination tests , behavi@@ our@@ al tests , reactions and manner of speaking .
yet by 2007 , only four EU countries ( Belgium , Portugal , Sweden , United Kingdom ) reported oblig@@ atory training in this area for traffic police , while 11 reported some ad ho@@ c training .
furthermore , the tests are not the same in each country .
covered by a general off@@ ence such as dangerous driving .
in contrast , laws in the Czech Republic , Estonia , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia pen@@ alise driving with any tr@@ ace of a sub@@ stance , even if medicin@@ al .
in Latvia , imp@@ air@@ ment by a medicin@@ al sub@@ stance will inc@@ ur a lower fine than any tr@@ ace of an illi@@ cit sub@@ stance .
they also show that many drivers are unaware of the effects of combin@@ ing drugs and alcohol .
after stop@@ ping a driver , the police officer may need to perform an initial screening for drug use , by analy@@ sing behaviour or biological samples .
oral f@@ lu@@ id ( sal@@ i@@ va ) might be acceptable for road@@ side screening of drivers - ur@@ ine is not appropriate to indicate imp@@ air@@ ment .
the reli@@ ability of devices for road@@ side sal@@ i@@ va testing , however , has yet to be confirmed .
of the nine on @@@ -@@ @ site sal@@ i@@ va @@@ -@@ @ testing devices evalu@@ ated by the EU 's Ros@@ ita @@@ -@@ @ 2 project between 2003 and 2005 , not one could be recommended for road@@ side screening of drivers .
the limit@@ ations of the devices might be compen@@ sa@@ ted to some extent by modi@@ fying the testing protocol .
prevention campaigns targeting drug driving have been carried out in several EU M@@ ember States .
these generally take the form of mass media campaigns , often including information on drugs within a wider campaign focus@@ sing on alcohol .
zero tolerance Imp@@ air@@ ment
General messages that reach young users of can@@ na@@ bis , however , are unlikely to be list@@ ened to , or even noticed , by older users of psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es , and vice ver@@ sa .
similarly , both groups may feel that warnings about alcohol do not apply to them .
prevention programmes are more likely to succeed if they are ta@@ il@@ ored to their target group .
providing clear information to patients taking psy@@ cho@@ active medicin@@ es may prevent them from driving while adver@@ sely affected .
for this , most countries rely on the patient information le@@ af@@ let inside the pack@@ aging , for example advis@@ ing caution if the patient feels sle@@ ep@@ y .
yet the patient 's subj@@ ec@@ tive sen@@ ses are not always reliable or accur@@ ate .
the use of a clear symbol or pic@@ to@@ gram on the ou@@ ter pack@@ aging of medicin@@ es that may affect driving ability is currently reported by only five countries .

responding to drug driving in Europe : conclusions and policy consider@@ ations
national laws and their enforcement need to strike a balance between concerns about ensuring road safety and the ther@@ ap@@ eu@@ tic needs of individuals .
surveys on the pre@@ val@@ ence of drugs in drivers need to be conducted in all EU M@@ ember States .
testing all drivers involved in a fatal accident for drug and alcohol use would provide an important source of information for monitoring the problem .
legal fra@@ me@@ works require review , as even with the limit@@ ations of existing testing meth@@ od@@ ology , more effective procedures are possible .
and , new options are likely to become available .
new guidelines on study design are available that take into account the variety of legal and practical constra@@ ints in different countries .
policymakers should consider the latest scientific information available when de@@ signing legal responses .

however , major environmental challenges remain which will have significant consequences for Europe if left un@@ addressed .
the result is a significant environmental foot@@ print in Europe and elsewhere .
however , widespread alter@@ ation of lands@@ cap@@ es , de@@ grad@@ ation of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems and loss of natural capital mean that the EU will not meet its target of hal@@ ting bio@@ diversity loss by 2010 .
natural resources and waste - Environmental regulation and eco @@@ -@@ @ innovation have increased resource efficiency through a relative dec@@ ou@@ pling of resource use , emissions and waste generation from economic growth in some areas .
however , absolute dec@@ ou@@ pling remains a challenge , especially for households .
this indicates scope not only to improve production processes further , but also to al@@ ter consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns to reduce environmental pressures .
environment , health and quality of life - Water and air pollution have declined but not enough to achieve good ecological quality in all water bodies or to ensure good air quality in all urban areas .
links between the state of Europe 's environment and various global me@@ g@@ at@@ ren@@ ds imply increasing system@@ ic risks .
these inter@@ depen@@ den@@ cies and trends , many of them outside Europe 's direct influence , will have significant consequences and potential risks for the res@@ ili@@ ence and sustainable development of Europe 's economy and society .
increased resource efficiency and security can be achieved , for example , using extended life cycle approaches to reflect the full environmental imp@@ acts of products and activities .
this can reduce Europe 's dependence on resources g@@ lob@@ ally and promote innovation .
C@@ lu@@ ster@@ ing sec@@ toral policies according to their resource needs and environmental pressures would improve co@@ her@@ ence , address shared challenges efficiently , maxim@@ ise economic and social benefits and help avoid un@@ intended consequences .
implementing environmental policies and strengthening environmental governance will continue to provide benefits .
better implementation of sec@@ toral and environmental policies will help ensure that goals are achieved and provide regulatory stability for businesses .
this includes reducing long @@@ -@@ @ term re@@ mediation costs through early action .
transformation towards a gre@@ ener European economy will ensure the long @@@ -@@ @ term environmental sustainability of Europe and its neighbourhood .
in this context , shi@@ fts in attitudes will be important .
using education and various social media , citizens can be engaged in tackling global issues such as meeting the 2 ° C climate target .
the se@@ eds for future actions exist : the task ahead is to help them take root and flo@@ ur@@ ish .
the state of the environment in Europe
Europe reli@@ es heavily on natural capital and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems at home and abroad
the Europe addressed in this report is home to around 600 million
with an average of 100 people per k@@ m@@ 2 , Europe is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the world ; some 75 % of the total population lives in urban
areas (
Europeans depend heavily on the sto@@ cks of natural capital and flows of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services that lie within and beyond Europe 's borders .
two fundamental questions arise from this dependency .
are the sto@@ cks and flows today being used sustain@@ ably to supply essential benefits , such as food , water , energy , materials , as well as climate and flood regulation ?
are today 's environmental resources , i@@ .@@ e@@ . air , water , soil , forests , bio@@ diversity , secure enough to be able to sustain people and economies in good health in the future ?
access to reliable up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date information about the environment provides a basis for action
to answer such questions , citizens and policymakers require acces@@ sible , relevant , credible , and legitimate information .

the E@@ EA 's annual Transport and Environment Reporting Mec@@ han@@ ism ( term ) report monitors the progress and effectiveness of efforts to integrate transport and environment strategies .
for 2009 , the report highlighted the following trends and findings :
the share of rail and in@@ land water@@ ways in the total fre@@ ight vol@@ u@@ mes declined during that period .
• P@@ ass@@ eng@@ er transport continued to grow but at a s@@ lower rate than the economy .
air travel within the EU remained the fas@@ test growth area , increasing 48 % between 1997 and 2007 .

integration of adap@@ tation into environmental and sec@@ toral policy dom@@ ain@@ s - such as those related to water , nature and bio@@ diversity , and resource efficiency - is an important aim .
however , the EU White Pap@@ er on adap@@ tation recognises that limited knowledge is a key barrier and calls for a stronger knowledge base .

the overall environmental impact of Europe 's resource use continues to grow
Europe reli@@ es heavily on natural resources ( A ) to fuel its economic development .
past and current production and consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns have under@@ pin@@ ned substantial growth in wealth across Europe .
however , concerns about the sustainability of these pat@@ ter@@ ns are mounting , particularly regarding the implications related to resource use and over @@@ -@@ @ use .
the assessment of natural resources and waste in this chapter comple@@ ments the assessment of bio@@ tic natural resources in the previous chapter by focusing on material , and often non @@@ -@@ @ renewable , resources as well as water resources .
a life @@@ -@@ @ cycle perspective on natural resources addresses several environmental concerns related to production and consumption , and ties together the use of resources and the generation of waste .
in Europe , resource use and waste generation continue to rise .
while resource extr@@ action within Europe has been stable over the past decade , dependence on imports is increasing ( 1 ) .
environmental problems associated with the extr@@ action and processing of many materials and natural resources are shif@@ ting from Europe to the respective exporting countries .
consequently , the imp@@ acts of consumption and resource use from Europe on the global environment are increasing .

this continues to have considerable environmental and economic consequences .
the resource use category which increased most between 1992 and 2005 was that of min@@ er@@ als for construction and industrial use .
differences between individual countries are significant : the use of resources per person var@@ ies by a factor of almost ten between the highest and the lowest numbers .
factors that determine resource use per person include climate , population den@@ s@@ ity , infrastructure , avail@@ ability of resources , level of economic development , and the structure of the economy .
although the level of extr@@ action of resources within Europe has remained stable , and in some cases has even decreased - some un@@ managed bur@@ den@@ s from past extr@@ action pers@@ ist related to mining clos@@ ures .
the high use of resources to fuel economic growth increases the problems of ensuring supplies and sustainable yi@@ elds , and managing the environmental imp@@ acts in relation to ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems ' absorption capacities .
a challenge for both policy and science is how best to measure environmental imp@@ acts that result from resource use ; several current initiatives aim to better quanti@@ fy the environmental imp@@ acts of resource use .

European economies are creating more and more wealth from the resources that we use .
however , differences in resource efficiency across Europe are substantial , with a factor of almost ten between the most and least resource @@@ -@@ @ efficient EU economies .
factors that affect resource efficiency include the technological level of production and consumption ; the share of services ver@@ sus heavy industry ; regulatory and tax systems ; and the share of imports in total resource use .

environment , health and quality of life
environment , health , life expec@@ tancy and social in@@ equ@@ alities are linked
the environment plays a crucial role in people 's physical , mental and social well @@@ -@@ @ being .
despite significant improvements , major differences in environmental quality and human health remain between and within European countries .
the complex relationships between environmental factors and human health , taking into account multiple path@@ ways and inter@@ actions , should be seen in a broader sp@@ ati@@ al , soci@@ o@@ economic and cultural context .
on average , men are expected to live almost 81 % of their lives free of dis@@ ability , and women 75 % ( 2 ) .
there are , however , differences between gen@@ ders , and between M@@ ember States .
re@@ productive and mental health problems are also on the rise .

due to uncertain@@ ties , the results need to be interpreted with caution as an indic@@ ative ranking of environmental health imp@@ acts only ( 6 ) .
the significant differences in the quality of the environment across Europe depend on the var@@ ying pressures related , for example , to ur@@ ban@@ isation , pollution and natural resource use .
expos@@ ures and associated health risks , as well as the benefits of pollution reduction and of a natural environment , are not uni@@ form@@ ly distributed within populations .

the assessments of four environmental priority areas - climate change , nature and bio@@ diversity , use of natural resources and waste , and environment and health - point to a series of direct and indirect links between environmental challenges .

bio@@ diversity loss and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem de@@ grad@@ ation directly affect climate change and under@@ mines the way we are able to use natural resources .
in addition , loss of natural infrastructure has been shown to have various harmful effects on human health ( C@@ hap@@ ter 5 ) .
the use of natural resources and the resulting pollution of air , water and soil put pressure on nature and bio@@ diversity through , for example , e@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ation and ac@@ idi@@ fication ( C@@ hap@@ ter 3 ) .
ultimately , the use of non @@@ -@@ @ renewable natural resources , such as fos@@ sil fuels , is at the heart of the debate about climate change .
in addition , waste management is a key sector with regard to green@@ house gas emissions ( C@@ hap@@ ter 2 ) .
how we use natural resources and dis@@ pose of was@@ tes also links directly to several health aspects and contributes to the environmental burden of disease ( C@@ hap@@ ter 5 ) .
ultimately , environmental pressures that result from , for example , climate change , bio@@ diversity loss , or the use of natural resources , are linked with people 's wel@@ l@@ being ( chapters 2 to 5 ) .
access to clean water and air are par@@ amount to our health , but is often undermined by pollution and waste that result from human activities ( chapters 4 and 5 ) .
many of the links described above and in the previous chapters are direct , i@@ .@@ e@@ . changes in the state of one environmental issue can trans@@ late directly into pressures of another .
in addition , a number of indirect links occur with changes in one environmental issue resulting in fe@@ ed@@ backs on another and vice ver@@ sa .

natural capital and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services
natural capital and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services em@@ br@@ ace many components .
natural capital is the stock of natural resources from which goods can be extr@@ acted and the flows of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services maintained .
the sto@@ cks and flows rely on ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem structures and functions such as lands@@ cap@@ es , soil , and bio@@ diversity .
there are three main types of natural capital which require different approaches to managing them :
• non @@@ -@@ @ renewable and exha@@ ust@@ able resources - fos@@ sil fuels , met@@ als , et@@ c . ; • renewable but exha@@ ust@@ able resources - fish sto@@ cks , water , soil , et@@ c . ; • renewable and non @@@ -@@ @ exha@@ ust@@ able resources - wind , waves , et@@ c .
natural capital provides several functions and services - it provides the sources of energy , food and materials ; the sin@@ ks for was@@ tes and pollution ; the services of climate and water regulation , pol@@ lin@@ ation ; and the space for living and le@@ is@@ ure .
using natural capital often involves trade @@@ -@@ @ offs between these functions and services .

soil de@@ grad@@ ation is a major environmental concern with many dimen@@ sions , including :
• soil er@@ os@@ ion is the wearing away of the land sur@@ face by water and wind .
the main causes of soil er@@ os@@ ion are in@@ appropriate land management practices , de@@ forest@@ ation , over@@ gra@@ z@@ ing , forest fires and construction activities .
er@@ os@@ ion rates are very sensitive to both climate and land use , as well as to detailed conserv@@ ation practice at the field level .
water er@@ os@@ ion affects 115 million hectares ( ha ) of soil or 12 % of Europe 's total land area , and wind er@@ os@@ ion 42 million ha .
the Mediterranean region is the most affected .
• soil se@@ aling occur@@ s when agricultural or other rural land is built on and all soil functions are lost .
on average , built @@@ -@@ @ up areas take up around 4 % of the total area of M@@ ember States , but not all of this is actually sealed .
• Sal@@ in@@ isation of so@@ ils results from human interven@@ tions such as in@@ appropriate ir@@ ri@@ gation practices , use of salt @@@ -@@ @ rich ir@@ ri@@ gation water and / or poor dra@@ in@@ age conditions .
ele@@ v@@ ated salt levels in soil limit its ag@@ ro @@@ -@@ @ ecological potential and represent a considerable ecological and soci@@ o@@ economic threat to sustainable development .
Sal@@ in@@ isation affects around 3.8 million ha in Europe .
the most affected areas are C@@ amp@@ ania in Italy and the E@@ br@@ o Valley in Spain , but areas in Greece , Portugal , France and Slovakia are also affected .

water makes vital contributions to economic activities including agriculture and energy production , and as a key transport route .
climate affects both the supply and demand for energy and water , and energy con@@ version and water extr@@ action processes have the potential to contribute to climate change .
at the EU and national levels , there are different sec@@ toral and environmental policies and measures that may conflict with water management and the objective of achieving a good ecological status of water bodies .
examples are policies for bio@@ energy crops and hydro @@@ -@@ @ energy , the promotion of ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated agriculture , the development of tourism , and expanding in@@ land water@@ way transport .

future environmental priorities : some reflec@@ tions
unprecedented change , inter@@ connected risks and increased vulner@@ abilities pose new challenges
the previous chapters highlight the fact that the world is experiencing environmental change and hence new challenges on a scale , speed and inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness that are unprecedented .
decades of intensive use of sto@@ cks of natural capital and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem de@@ grad@@ ation by developed countries to fuel economic development have resulted in global warming , loss of bio@@ diversity and various negative imp@@ acts on our health .
the long @@@ -@@ @ term ambi@@ tion of achieving 80 to 95 % reductions in C@@ O
as in the past , future climate change imp@@ acts are expected to affect dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately the most vulnerable in society : children , the elderly , and the poor .
on the positive side , greater access to green
S y n the he si s IS@@ S sp@@ aces , bio@@ diversity , clean water and air benefit people 's health .
however , this too raises the question about the sharing of access and benefits , since often sp@@ ati@@ al planning and investment decisions favour the rich at the expense of the poor .
well @@@ -@@ @ maintained ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services are essential to support climate change m@@ iti@@ gation and adap@@ tation objectives , and preserving bio@@ diversity is a prerequisite for ensuring this .
as these demands increase , for example for chemical sub@@ stitu@@ tes , there are likely to be increasing conflicts with existing uses for food , transport and le@@ is@@ ure .
su@@ dden break@@ dow@@ ns in one area or geographical region can trans@@ mit large @@@ -@@ @ scale fail@@ ures through a whole network of economies , via Con@@ tag@@ ion , fe@@ ed@@ backs and other amp@@ lif@@ ic@@ ations .
the recent global financial crash or the Icel@@ an@@ dic
vol@@ can@@ o ep@@ iso@@ des have demonstrated this (
crises such as these have also shown how difficult it is for society to deal with risks . well sign@@ posted and numerous early warnings
there is no single ' quick fix ' for the challenges that Europe faces .
rather , as this report shows , there is a clear case for long @@@ -@@ @ term , inter@@ connected approaches to deal with them .
what this report also provides is evidence that existing European environmental policies present a robust basis on which to build new approaches that balance economic , social and environmental consider@@ ations .
implementing and strengthening environmental protection provides multiple benefits
full implementation of environmental policies in Europe remains par@@ amount , as key targets are still to be met ( C@@ hap@@ ter 1 ) .
however , it is clear that targets in one area can in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently , through un@@ intended consequences , dis@@ rupt or counter@@ act a target in another .
such policies have per@@ mitted the economy to grow well beyond what might otherwise have been feasible .
for example , without tightening
there are also an@@ cil@@ lary benefits from combined implementation of environmental legislation .
for example , combin@@ ing climate change m@@ iti@@ gation and air pollution ab@@ ate@@ ment legislation could deliver benefits in the order of EU@@ R 10 billion per year through reductions in damage to public health and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems ( A ) ( 11 ) .
environmental producer responsibility legislation ( such as reach ( 12 ) , W@@ E@@ E@@ E
) ) has contributed to push multi @@@ -@@ @ national companies , for example , to design production processes at global level that meet EU standards and so deliver benefits for consumers across the world .
in addition , EU legislation is often rep@@ lic@@ ated in China , India , California and elsewhere , highligh@@ ting further the multiple benefits of well @@@ -@@ @ designed policies in the global@@ ised economy .
European countries have also invested substan@@ tially in monitoring and regular reporting of environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and was@@ tes .
they are beginning to use the best available information and communication technologies and sources to develop information flows from in @@@ -@@ @ sit@@ u instruments to Earth ob@@ servation with specialised sen@@ sors .
there are a number of information policies and processes in place or being negotiated in Europe to support swi@@ f@@ ter responses to emerging challenges .
the desire to make economic and social progress that does not come at the expense of the natural environment is not new .
many European industries have dec@@ ou@@ pled emissions of key poll@@ ut@@ ants and the use of certain materials from economic growth .
what is new is that management of natural capital requires dec@@ ou@@ pling of economic growth not only from resource use but also from environmental imp@@ acts within Europe and g@@ lob@@ ally .
natural capital embrac@@ es many components .
it is the stock of natural resources from which ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems goods and services can be der@@ ived .
using it often involves trade @@@ -@@ @ offs between different services and striking a balance between maintaining and using sto@@ cks .
there are three main types of natural capital ( C@@ hap@@ ter 6 ) which require different policy measures to manage them .
in some cases , natural capital that is dep@@ le@@ ted can be sub@@ stitu@@ ted by other types of capital , such as non @@@ -@@ @ renewable energy resources that are used to develop and invest in renewable energy sources .
however , more
since the industrial revolution there has been a shift away from using renewable resources to non @@@ -@@ @ rene@@ w@@ ables to fuel our economy .
such trends make Europe vulnerable to external supply shocks that may result from an over @@@ -@@ @ reli@@ ance on non @@@ -@@ @ rene@@ w@@ ables .
addressing this bias could be a key element in meeting the resource efficiency objective under the EU 2020 strategy ( 15 ) .
a broader argument for shif@@ ting towards long @@@ -@@ @ term development based on natural capital management is that today 's poor governance of natural resources is for@@ war@@ ding risks to future generations .
particularly land and water resources offer viable entry points for strengthening integrated ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem @@@ -@@ @ based approaches to resource management .
the Water Framework Direc@@ tive , for example , has the aim of protecting ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems - aqu@@ atic and ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al - at its core .
approaches that recognise the multi@@ functional benefits of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems are central to proposals for post @@@ -@@ @ 2010 bio@@ diversity policies and gaining tr@@ action in the mar@@ ine , maritime , agriculture and forest@@ ry sectors .
as integrated management of natural resources becomes more prominent , competing demand for resources increasingly requires trade @@@ -@@ @ offs .
this creates a need for accounting techniques - including , in particular , comprehensive accounting of land and water resources - that make transparent the full costs and benefits of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem use and maintenance .
in addition , the identification of critical th@@ res@@ holds in resource use and the development of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem accounts , ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem service indicators and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem assessments are ongoing in Europe and g@@ lob@@ ally .
examples of such initiatives are The Economics of E@@ cos@@ y@@ stems and Bi@@ odi@@ versity ( TE@@ E@@ B ) , the revision of In@@ tegrated Environmental and
more integrated actions across policy dom@@ ain@@ s can help in gre@@ ening the economy
environmental policies have primarily influenced production processes and protected human health .
they therefore only partly address today 's system@@ ic risks .
this is because many of the causes of environmental problems , such as over @@@ -@@ @ use of the land and O@@ ce@@ ans , are overwhel@@ ming the progress being made ( C@@ hap@@ ter 1 ) .
such causes often origin@@ ate from multiple sources and economic activities that compete for short @@@ -@@ @ term benefits from resource exploitation .
S y n the he si s IS@@ S maxim@@ ise benefits and avoid un@@ intended consequences .
examples of achieving such co@@ her@@ ence include :
this marks a key difference compared to the situation 15 to 20 years ago and provides precedent for more effective collaboration between sec@@ toral and environmental interests .
S y n the he si s IS@@ S gains from investments in green technologies .
for example , investment in energy efficiency and renewable ener@@ gies deli@@ vers benefits to the environment , employment , energy security , energy costs , and can help combat fuel poverty .
the pollu@@ ter pays principle can stimulate a gre@@ ening of the economy through taxes that allow market prices to reflect full costs of production , consumption and was@@ tes .
however , for this to happen - as known for decades , but rarely applied - prices need to reflect the true economic , environmental and social value of resources , relative to available sub@@ stitu@@ tes .
evidence of the benefits of fiscal reform has grown in recent years .
such benefits include environmental improvements , employment gains , a sti@@ mul@@ us to eco @@@ -@@ @ innovation and more efficient tax systems .
Studies show the benefits from modest environmental tax reform in several European countries that have been implemented over the last 20 years .
similarly , they convinc@@ ingly demonstrate the advantages of additional reforms designed to achieve the EU climate and resource
efficiency goals (
accounting fully for natural capital will also require new clas@@ si@@ fic@@ ations , ide@@ ally linked to existing ones as described in the statistical fra@@ me@@ works and system of national accounts ( SNA ) .
important examples are emerging , for example in the area of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services ( 35 ) or car@@ bon accounting and car@@ bon credi@@ ting .
the challenge now is to improve the knowledge base in order to support more accountable and particip@@ atory decision making .
providing access to information is essential for effective governance ; but eng@@ aging people in collecting data and sharing their lay knowledge is
arguably just as important (
a further ref@@ le@@ ction concerns equip@@ ping Europeans with the skills to make the transformation to a green economy .
a good example is the European recycling industry which holds a 50 % global market and has been increasing employment by some 10 % annually , mostly for un@@ skilled workers ( 39 ) .
there is scope to foster further the role of small and medium enterprises in natural capital management .

E@@ EA S@@ ign@@ als are annual reports covering a broad range of topics .
they are typically built around 20 @@@ -@@ @ 30 pages of indicator @@@ -@@ @ based assessment w@@ ri � en in non @@@ -@@ @ technical language for a broad audience with graph@@ ics to support the text .
they are translated into all E@@ EA languages .
the key messages in this year 's report highlight the need to make further progress in managing the environmental imp@@ acts of agriculture , transport and energy .
similar instruments can also help deal with un@@ sustainable trends in waste generation .
the sp@@ in @@@ -@@ @ off benefits for the environment and human health will be multi @@@ -@@ @ dimen@@ sional across issues such as climate change , air pollution , bio@@ diversity and water quality .
the major events in Europe 's environment during 2003 were we@@ a@@ ther@@ - and cli@@ mater@@ e@@ lated .
the hot summer claimed possibly as many as 35 000 lives , mainly in southern Europe .
ozone pollution levels were especially high , while un@@ usually low water flows were recorded in the Danube , R@@ hine and other major rivers , in sharp contrast with the heavy flooding the summer before .
the summer 2003 forest fires claimed lives and cost some EU@@ R 9@@ 25 million in Portugal alone .
it is estimated that in Europe around three quarters of economic losses caused by catastrop@@ hic events result from we@@ a@@ ther@@ - and climate @@@ -@@ @ related events .
a very conservative estimate of the annual average bill is about EU@@ R 10 billion and rising .
these figures suggest that managing Europe 's natural resources is increasingly important for ensuring the vi@@ ability of Europe 's economic and social capital .
in general , environmental data are improving but they remain inadequate to meet the task of monitoring changes .
for example , water quality data need to become more statisti@@ cally representative at cat@@ ch@@ ment level , while air quality monitoring for small parti@@ c@@ les ( PM

the time@@ lin@@ ess of all data needs to be improved .
the European Environment Agency is working to improve data by ensuring there is complete coverage over time for all member countries and that data delivered are as accur@@ ate as possible .
work continues to improve indicator meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies , focusing primarily on the E@@ EA core set of indicators ( www.@@ e@@ e@@ a@@ .@@ eu@@ .@@ int / co@@ re@@ set ) .

professor Jacqu@@ eline Mc@@ Gla@@ de Executive Director
Europe 's environment should be considered in the context of soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic agen@@ das , such as the Lisbon process and sustainable development , that also have a strong global dimension .
in March 2000 the Lisbon European Council set a new strategic goal ( 1 ) for Europe .
the main barriers to progress in environmental protection and sustainability are the complex , inter @@@ -@@ @ sec@@ toral , inter @@@ -@@ @ disciplinary and international nature of both the problems and the solutions .
such solutions em@@ br@@ ace competitiveness and innovation , social co@@ hesion , territorial co@@ hesion and the protection and maintenance of scar@@ ce natural resources and valuable ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems .
the European Union is the second largest economy behind the United States , with a vast array of assets and a lead part to play in global governance .
the Lisbon economic agenda aims to deliver higher growth and more and be � E@@ R jobs , but progress towards its objectives is mixed .
employment growth in these M@@ ember States has also la@@ gged behind the United States since 1990 , but labour productivity has been more closely al@@ ig@@ ned .
competitiveness and innovation are defining conditions for growth to deliver sustainable out@@ comes for Europe 's economy , society and environment .
in the future , ambitious regions in the new EU M@@ ember States are expected to over@@ take the least competitive among the older M@@ ember States .
Norway and Switzerland also perform well .
the extent of knowledge creation and the u@@ tilis@@ ation of human capital distingu@@ ish the competitive performers from the less competitive .
many of these countries and regions also perform relatively well on environmental issues , indicating that economic and environmental goals can be achieved together .
reducing regional dis@@ par@@ ities , the main goal of the European Union 's co@@ hesion policy , is expected to further enhance ' be � E@@ R ' growth ( see European Commission 3rd Co@@ hesion Report , February 2004 ) .
be � E@@ R growth also means improved resource productivity .
there was a slight increase per capita in the use of materials in the European Union economy between 1980 and 2000 .
Europe leads on environmental technology innov@@ ations , for example on more sustainable manufacturing materials and processes , renewable ener@@ gies and waste treatment practices .
research is key to maintaining progress .
there is also a lot to be achieved by promoting the use of venture capital in em@@ br@@ yo nic@@ he markets .
social changes in Europe are being driven by enlargement , demographic changes and globalisation .
these in turn are influ@@ encing consumption PA � er@@ ns and sp@@ ati@@ al planning decisions , with transport in particular playing an increasingly pi@@ vo@@ tal role in the economy and people 's lives .
wealth per capita di@@ ffers substan@@ tially between the west and east of the European Union .
the now en@@ lar@@ ged Union has 20 % more population and 25 % more territory .
the pressures on urban ag@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ations across Europe are expected to increase further as people seek to improve their living standards by moving to where the employment opportunities are greatest .
these trends will increase pressure on existing urban infrastructure and services but will also create opportunities for building more sustainable cities that accommodate economic , social and environmental aspirations .
in this evol@@ ving context , Europe 's population is expected to increase until about 2020 , a � E@@ R which it will stabilise and then decline .
however the working @@@ -@@ @ age population ( those aged 15 @@@ -@@ @ 64 ) is expected to start falling a few years earlier , from 2010 , with consequences for sustain@@ ing employment and innovation .
in parallel , there will be a marked increase in older persons ( aged 65 and over ) .
the consumption demand PA � er@@ ns of older people tend to Sh@@ i � towards services such as social and le@@ is@@ ure activities , including tourism , with consequ@@ ent environmental imp@@ acts .
so , for example , the explosive increase in air travel , which is the fas@@ test growing source of green@@ house gas emissions , reflects in part these changes in demo@@ graphy .
while Europe 's population stabil@@ ises and ages , the number of households will increase at a more rapid rate .
in the European Union the number grew by 11 % between 1990 and 2000 ( 4 ) and is expected to continue rising .
the majority of new households will be small , reflecting social and lif@@ estyle changes such as increasing numbers of single and div@@ or@@ ced people .
smaller households tend to be less efficient , requiring more resources per capita ( 5 ) than larger households .
the trend towards smaller households also increases the pressure on land and acts as a factor driving the expansion of built @@@ -@@ @ up areas .
over 80 % of Europeans ( 6 ) are expected to live in urban areas by 2020 .
Europe 's rural population , in turn , is declining and this long @@@ -@@ @ observed trend is expected to continue ( 7 ) .

this has implications for soil as a resource for future generations .

it is forecast that 80 % of Europeans will be living in urban areas by 2020 , and in seven countries the pro@@ portion will be 90 % or more .

current rural development spending in M@@ ember States is not sufficiently targeted at bio@@ diversity @@@ -@@ @ rich areas .
Europe 's country@@ side has been shap@@ ed by agriculture over centuries and much of Europe 's bio@@ diversity depends in some way on far@@ m@@ land .
protecting valuable far@@ m@@ land is important for hal@@ ting the loss of bio@@ diversity .
however , by 2003 the sites designated by
the common agricultural policy accounts for about 50 % of the total European Union budget and influ@@ ences how farmers manage their land and li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
past subsidies encouraged intensive agricultural production by paying per ton@@ ne of wheat or per head of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck produced .
these help to fund the protection of high nature value far@@ m@@ lands , under@@ pin@@ ning the activities of the L@@ I@@ FE ( Nat@@ ure ) programme .
both these trends have negative environmental consequences , especially on bio@@ diversity .
the share of rural development measures in the common agricultural policy budget has increased since 1990 and accounted for 13 % ( equivalent to EU@@ R 53 per hectar@@ e ) in 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2002 .
in absolute terms , however , the level of rural development spending is similar .
as well as taking a higher share of the total agricultural budget it is important that rural development expendi@@ ture , and in particular the agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes , is properly targeted at areas of high bio@@ diversity .
some 30 @@@ -@@ @ 40 % of rural development funding is used for agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes but levels of spending v@@ ary widely between countries .

water pollution : managing nit@@ rate
Di@@ ff@@ use pollution from agricultural land is still the main source of nit@@ rate in water .
Nit@@ rates continue to damage the environment , contributing to e@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ation in coastal and mar@@ ine waters and pollution of drinking water , especially where ground@@ waters have become cont@@ am@@ inated .
member States ' success in tackling nit@@ rate pollution has been mixed .
Nit@@ rate pollution is caused mainly by agriculture .
unless fer@@ tilis@@ er and man@@ ure are absor@@ bed by crops or removed during har@@ v@@ esting , exc@@ ess nit@@ rate can be was@@ hed into ground@@ water as well as sur@@ face water bodies ( 13 ) .
measures to reduce nit@@ rate pollution can be effective however .
the greatest improvements have occurred in Denmark , which began a national nit@@ ro@@ gen management programme in the late 1980s .
this combin@@ es advice to farmers with the allocation of an annual nit@@ ro@@ gen ' budget ' to each farm , enforced through regular field checks .
substantial time la@@ gs can occur before changes in agricultural practices are reflected in ground@@ water quality , depending on the soil type and the specific hydro@@ ge@@ ological conditions of the ground@@ water body and over@@ lying sub@@ str@@ ate .
as ground@@ water ran@@ ges in age from decades to mil@@ len@@ nia ( although ground@@ water used for drinking water is on average 40 years old ) , current practices are in effect leaving a legacy of ground@@ water pollution for coming generations .
around one third of ground@@ water bodies ( 14 ) now exceed nit@@ rate guide@@ line values .
consumers , rather than the pollu@@ ters ( i@@ .@@ e@@ . farmers ) , pay almost all of the bill .
agricultural practices are currently less intensive in the ten new EU M@@ ember States than in the 15 older ones .
however , if far@@ ming becomes more intensive in the new M@@ ember States , as predicted , nit@@ rate concentr@@ ations in sur@@ face and ground waters could increase .

in 2001 , nit@@ rate levels in rivers where ar@@ able land covers more than 50 % of the up@@ stream cat@@ ch@@ ment area were three times higher than in cat@@ ch@@ ments with ar@@ able land cover of less than 10 % .

nature : maxim@@ ising the value of protected areas
the future of nature protection lies in integr@@ ating bio@@ diversity consider@@ ations into sec@@ toral and environmental policies and maxim@@ ising the utility of existing protected sites .
more needs to be done to protect mar@@ ine bio@@ diversity .
since the 197@@ 0s , the number of national sites has increased substan@@ tially as countries have pro@@ gres@@ sively implemented national laws on nature protection .
international and European Union instruments have also made it comp@@ ul@@ sory for countries to designate sites for protection ( 19 ) .
as a result there are now nearly 600 different categories of protection and more than 42 000 individual protected sites in the European Environment Agency 's 31 member countries .
additionally , mar@@ ine protected areas have been created in all of the regional seas and on the co@@ asts of many European countries .
however , there remain substantial g@@ aps in the protection of mar@@ ine and coastal areas .
Mar@@ ine areas should be protected according to the rich@@ ness of their bio@@ diversity , but this protection may conflict with other uses including shipping or fishing .
agreeing on an appropriate level of protection and then enfor@@ cing it is therefore o � en difficult .
protected areas can@@ not be sustained in isolation from the communities and economic activities in and around them ( 20 ) .
to maxim@@ ise their value , protected areas need to be integrated into wider landscape uses and be connected to other areas of similar qu@@ alities .
connecting sites ensu@@ res that species have the possibility to survive by moving in response to distur@@ ban@@ ces and climate change .
the N@@ atur@@ a 2000 network can play a role in achieving such integration .
there is now less scope for design@@ ating new sites as protecting bio@@ diversity compe@@ tes with growing and conflic@@ ting pressures on available land .

fish play an integral role within the wider mar@@ ine environment , which is experiencing pressures from shipping , pollution , coastal e@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ation and climate change .
the continuation of present trends of over @@@ -@@ @ fishing will therefore probably lead to substantial changes across the entire mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .

Pack@@ aging waste : still increasing
prevention has long been the highest priority of European Union waste policy : only where the production of waste is un@@ avoi@@ dable should recycling and re@@ use of waste be encouraged .
yet Europe has made li � le progress in preventing pack@@ aging waste .
while many countries have met the targets for recycling set under the 1994 pack@@ aging waste direc@@ tive , the amount of pack@@ aging waste is still increasing .
data suggest overall vol@@ u@@ mes of waste are continuing to grow in Europe .
total waste is made up of several waste stre@@ ams .
the largest is construction and demol@@ ition waste , but pack@@ aging waste is the best documented in terms of quantities produced and treated .
the generation of pack@@ aging waste is closely coup@@ led to economic growth and consumption PA � er@@ ns .
from 1997 to 2001 the amount of pack@@ aging waste increased in 10 of the 15 older EU M@@ ember States , and by 7 % in the then European Union as a whole .
preliminary projections suggest that vol@@ u@@ mes of pack@@ aging waste are likely to continue rising substan@@ tially in the future ( 22 ) .
some of this increase is a � ri@@ but@@ able to the propor@@ tion@@ ately higher generation of pack@@ aging waste from small households , but also to the growth of the internal market and the consequently greater need to transport pack@@ aged goods .
with rising emphasis on health and food safety , the amount of food pack@@ aging has also been increasing .
the European Union Pack@@ aging W@@ as@@ te Direc@@ tive ( 94 / 62 / EC ) addresses the elements of pack@@ aging waste management in a general way while placing emphasis on recycling and recovery by se � ing quanti@@ t@@ ative targets for both .
an initial analysis ( 23 ) suggests that for some countries ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . Italy and Ireland ) the direc@@ tive has had a positive impact on the implementation of pack@@ aging waste management systems .
in general , countries that have implemented a mi@@ x of instruments have been most effective in meeting their objectives and targets .
the direc@@ tive was amended in January 2004 but as it contains no waste prevention targets it can have only an indirect effect on the prevention of pack@@ aging waste .
the so@@ und@@ ness of recycling as a strategy for s@@ mar@@ ter resource use has recently been questioned ( 25 ) , but recycling is in most cases be � E@@ R for the environment than either energy recovery or disposal .
as the cost of recycling rises with the percentage of material recy@@ c@@ led however , a comparison of the costs ( including external costs ) of alternative options is likely to limit the scope for raising recycling targets continu@@ ally .
gener@@ ating less waste in the first place must remain the fore@@ most objective .
between 1997 and 2001 total pack@@ aging waste increased by 7 % in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 .
Pack@@ aging waste quantities v@@ ary substan@@ tially between countries , most likely due to different calc@@ ulation meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies .
in particular some countries report only on the four key materials for which M@@ ember States are required to provide data - plastic , glass , metal and paper .
others report on all pack@@ aging including wood , which substan@@ tially increases the total weight recorded .
the main forms of recovery are recycling and inc@@ iner@@ ation to produce energy .
the use of inc@@ iner@@ ation is high in some countries e@@ .@@ g@@ . Denmark and the Netherlands , while in others , e@@ .@@ g@@ . Germany and Austria , more recycling is used .
the revised direc@@ tive , adopted in January 2004 , will effectively restric@@ t the scope for inc@@ iner@@ ation and other recovery methods except recycling .
in some countries this will require substantial changes to the collection and sor@@ ting of was@@ tes .
the direc@@ tive 's targets are to be met by the end of 2008 .
several countries , in particular the New @@@ -@@ @ 10 , are still a long way from meeting this . some , including Estonia , Cyprus , Lithuania , Malta , Poland and Slovakia , but also Ireland , will need to more than double the pro@@ portion they recy@@ c@@ led in 2002 .

sustainable energy : a long way to go
total energy consumption continues to increase rapidly , making it difficult for Europe to reach its objectives on climate change .
if explo@@ ited more fully , energy efficiency and renewable energy sources could make a major contribution to a more sustainable energy system .
achieving this will require deep changes throughout the economy .
total energy consumption in the 25 M@@ ember States has been rising since the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s and this trend is expected to continue .
burning fos@@ sil fuels , the main source of green@@ house gas emissions , is predicted to remain the largest energy source in Europe for the next 30 years .
the transition to sustainable energy will require substantial increases in energy savings , energy efficiency and renewable energy production across all sectors .
substantial growth in renewable energy is needed to meet European and national targets for 2010 and will require further support .
creating favourable conditions for rene@@ w@@ ables is a key requirement for increasing their market share .
increased support for rene@@ w@@ ables will drive innovation and new technologies .
the recently proposed energy services direc@@ tive ( 26 ) is another step in the right direction .
it aims to lower energy consumption by se � ing mandatory targets for M@@ ember States to save 1 % per year of energy supplied between 2006 and
this potential needs to be realised to move Europe further towards a sustainable energy future .

transport : full @@@ -@@ @ cost pri@@ cing needed
demand for transport , especially road transport , is growing rapidly .
this increase has implications across many areas , including energy consumption , climate change and human health .
Dec@@ ou@@ pling transport demand from economic growth has been a key aim of EU transport policy for several years but has yet to show results .
fre@@ ight vol@@ u@@ mes are growing faster than the economy ( at around 3 % a year compared with 2 % , for the 15 older EU M@@ ember States ) ( 31 ) .
this largely reflects the pan @@@ -@@ @ European production and consumption PA � er@@ ns that are accompan@@ ying the expansion of the EU internal market .
passenger transport is increasing at the same rate as the economy .
air transport is growing by 6 @@@ -@@ @ 9 % per year in both the old and new EU M@@ ember States .
at the same time the market shares of mo@@ des such as rail and buses are increasing only margin@@ ally , if at all .
options for managing the environmental imp@@ acts of transport include adjust@@ ing prices to account fully for its external costs and promoting innovation through improved regulation and financial incentives .
prices are an important factor for ste@@ ering demand in a market economy , and in the case of transport both the level and the structure of us@@ er prices are relevant .
regulations to deal with issues such as air pollution ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . parti@@ c@@ ulates ) and no@@ ise , together with investment incentives , can drive innovation towards clean@@ er , safer and qu@@ i@@ eter transport .
this would in turn help reduce external costs .
there is clear agreement that transport prices do not fully cover the external costs caused by transport activities , although consensus is lacking on the exact figure to be paid .
contrary to inten@@ tions , vari@@ able charges for road fre@@ ight were actually reduced between 1998 and 2001 .
the most important vari@@ able element is taxation on fuel , but fuel prices have remained within the same price range for more than 20 years .
implementing full @@@ -@@ @ cost pri@@ cing could help reduce environmental imp@@ acts in the same way as regulating air poll@@ ut@@ ants has led to substantial decreas@@ es in the regulated emissions .
transport growth and gross domestic product
there has been no success in dec@@ ou@@ pling transport demand from economic growth , either for fre@@ ight or passenger transport .
at around 3 % a year , fre@@ ight transport is increasing faster than gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which is growing at around 2 % annually .
passenger transport is increasing at the same rate as GDP .
the reasons are complex but largely linked to soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic factors such as the expansion of the EU internal market , which is driving the rise in fre@@ ight transport .
for passenger transport , the reasons include increased car use for comm@@ ut@@ ing , le@@ is@@ ure and tourism .

sul@@ ph@@ ur di@@ ox@@ ide is a different case : large reductions in road transport emissions ( 61 % ) have been off@@ set by a similar increase in emissions from international maritime transport .
thus in effect the exposure of people to sul@@ ph@@ ur di@@ ox@@ ide has been reduced but not the overall emissions .

in overall terms , vari@@ able charges in EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 fell by 7 % in this period .
this is partly a result of the protests in September 2000 by fre@@ ight transport companies , farmers and fisher@@ men against rising fuel prices .
the diesel tax is still the most important instrument in value terms .
in addition several EU countries , e@@ .@@ g@@ . Germany , Austria and the UK , plan to introduce distance @@@ -@@ @ based charges .
these will help to reduce road transport 's net external costs to the environment .

their effect is likely to be addi@@ tive , at least in the short
these health imp@@ acts are caused by high concentr@@ ations that occur mainly in the urban areas of central , eastern and southern Europe .
for parti@@ c@@ ulates , high levels occur over the whole year , while ozone is mainly a problem during the summer months .
ozone levels were especially high during the summer he@@ at@@ wave of 2003 .
some people are more vulnerable to high concentr@@ ations of ozone and fine parti@@ c@@ ulates than others .
the worst effects are generally seen in children , as@@ th@@ m@@ atics and the elderly , as well as those exerc@@ ising out@@ doors .
the emis@@ sion cuts achieved so far have been mainly due to the introduction of cataly@@ sts on new cars and to the implementation of the EU sol@@ ven@@ ts direc@@ tive , which has led to lower emissions from industrial processes .
there is now growing evidence of adver@@ se health effects from concentr@@ ations of fine parti@@ c@@ ulates and ozone at levels below the values currently set to protect health .
discussions are under way within the framework of the EU C@@ le@@ an Air for Europe process ( 35 ) that may lead to present limits being re@@ considered and eventually tigh@@ tened .

substantial reductions in emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es will be required to ensure that Europe meets its short @@@ -@@ @ term emis@@ sion targets .
adap@@ tation measures to manage the negative imp@@ acts of climate change also need to be put into place .
combating climate change is a key environmental priority for the European Union .
the average temper@@ ature in Europe has increased by 0.@@ 95 ° C over the past 100 years and is projected to rise by as much as a further 6.@@ 3 ° C by 2@@ 100 .
other imp@@ acts include an increase of about ten days in the average growing season in Europe over the past 20 years .
however , projections indicate that this positive development may in some areas be counter@@ acted by an increased risk of water shortage , which would harm veget@@ ation .
these changes in growing season length may require adap@@ tation measures and changes in agriculture and nature protection strategies .

Fo@@ re@@ word high nature value far@@ m@@ land are currently lacking , however .
in the K@@ yi@@ v Resolution on Bi@@ odi@@ versity , the European environment ministers therefore agreed to identify high nature value far@@ m@@ land and take adequate conserv@@ ation measures .
Europe 's rich cultural and natural heritage is reflected in its traditional agricultural lands@@ cap@@ es .
high nature value far@@ m@@ land comp@@ rises the hot spots of biological diversity in rural areas and is o � en character@@ istic of extensive far@@ ming practices .
as a contribution to this process , E@@ EA and UN@@ EP have commissioned a study on agriculture and bio@@ diversity and a study to quanti@@ fy and de@@ lin@@ e@@ ate high nature value far@@ m@@ land areas .
the outcome is this joint report , in which preliminary data on the distribution and conserv@@ ation status of high nature value far@@ m@@ land and the current targeting of policy instruments are presented .
over the last few decades , however , bio@@ diversity on far@@ m@@ land has declined seriously .
large scale ration@@ alisation and intensi@@ fication of agricultural production has taken its toll .
many margin@@ al and exten@@ sively far@@ med areas were either improved or abandoned , thus considerably reducing ha@@ bit@@ at and species diversity .
S@@ emin@@ atural veget@@ ation has declined rapidly and roughly two thirds of the currently endangered bird species depend on agricultural ha@@ bit@@ ats .
we sinc@@ er@@ ely hope that this joint report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to elabor@@ ate and ref@@ ine the high nature value far@@ m@@ land concept , and further focus their conserv@@ ation efforts .
in the sixth environment action programme , the EU has comm@@ i � ed itself to halt bio@@ diversity decline by 2010 .
con@@ serving high nature value far@@ m@@ land is key to achieving this target .
Pan@@ European data on distribution and conserv@@ ation status of
traditional agricultural systems have shap@@ ed the European landscape and created ha@@ bit@@ ats for a wide range of species , many of which are of particular conserv@@ ation concern .
high nature value far@@ m@@ land comp@@ rises hot spots of bio@@ diversity in rural areas and is usually characterised by extensive far@@ ming practices .
its conserv@@ ation value is acknowledged in several EU policy documents such as the EU Regula@@ tion on rural development ( EC 12@@ 57 / 1999 ) .
distribution and conserv@@ ation status of high nature value far@@ m@@ land , however , has not yet been assessed at the pan@@ European level .
and alp@@ ine pas@@ tures and me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws . agriculture in these areas is usually extensive and vulnerable to change .
high nature value far@@ m@@ land areas are generally under severe pressure due to a vulnerable economy and de@@ population .
pre@@ dominant agricultural trends are intensi@@ fication on the one hand and land aband@@ on@@ ment on the other .
both are considered de@@ tri@@ mental to bio@@ diversity .
policy responses in the EU include site protection under the ha@@ bit@@ ats and bird direc@@ tives and environment measures under the common agricultural policy .
the N@@ atur@@ a 2000 sites , as proposed by the M@@ ember States , cover less than one third of high nature value far@@ m@@ land area .
their conserv@@ ation status is again largely unknown .
a monitoring system is under development but not yet operational .
the target is to cover ' a substantial pro@@ portion ' of such areas with rural development and agri@@ environment measures by 2008 . a high nature value far@@ m@@ land indicator is currently under preparation within the framework of I@@ RE@@ NA@@ 1 .
this joint report highlights the preliminary results of this indicator and analy@@ ses the current targeting of high nature value far@@ m@@ land by policy measures .
according to our preliminary estimates , roughly 15 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % of the European country@@ side quali@@ fies as high nature value far@@ m@@ land .
the largest areas are found in eastern and southern Europe .
they cons@@ ist of ha@@ bit@@ ats such as semin@@ atural gr@@ ass@@ lands , de@@ hes@@ as , mon@@ tad@@ os and ste@@ p@@ pe areas .
high nature value far@@ m@@ land is also relatively ab@@ und@@ ant in mountainous regions .

current policy measures appear insufficient to prevent further decline in high nature value far@@ m@@ land areas and thus to reach the 2010 bio@@ diversity target .
the geographical targeting of agriculture subsidies , especially of less favoured area support and agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes , needs to be re@@ considered .
it should be kept in mind , though , that the current data do not allow for detailed geographical analysis .
a major effort is needed to fill the data g@@ aps on ha@@ bit@@ at and species distribution and the targeting and effectiveness of support measures .

Europe is famous for its unique rural lands@@ cap@@ es that represent a rich cultural and natural heritage .
regi@@ onally differing far@@ ming practices have led to a variety of agricultural ha@@ bit@@ ats that host a large number of plant and animal species .
the bio@@ diversity of far@@ m@@ land , however , has rapidly declined across Europe in the last few decades , as illu@@ strated here for common birds of the country@@ side ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 , see also Donald et al . , 2001 ) .

trends in high nature value far@@ m@@ land the use of nit@@ ro@@ gen@@ ous fer@@ tilis@@ ers ( F@@ ig@@ ure 5 ) .
high nature value far@@ m@@ land is threatened by two contr@@ asting trends : intensi@@ fication and aband@@ on@@ ment .
fer@@ tilis@@ er use in western Europe appears generally to have lev@@ elled off .
intensi@@ fication
environmental pressures are expected to decrease somewhat in western Europe , wh@@ il@@ st many areas in central and eastern Europe will experience increasing agricultural inten@@ s@@ ity .
this means that some of the high nature value far@@ m@@ land will probably be ex@@ posed to intensi@@ fication in the near future .
where natural and economic conditions allow , far@@ ming will intensify in order to increase yi@@ elds and overall efficiency .
this has been a continuous process in most parts of western Europe for decades , reflected in a steady increase in fer@@ tilis@@ er in@@ puts and milk and cer@@ e@@ al yi@@ elds .
in eastern Europe investment in the agricultural sector has dropped substan@@ tially due to the political and econom@@ ical changes during the 1990s .
this is reflected in the su@@ dden drop in
N @@@ -@@ @ fer@@ tilis@@ er consumption in selected central and eastern European countries * and the EU kg / ha 80
the soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic conditions in rural areas with extensive agriculture are generally un@@ favourable .
the pro@@ portion of the elderly is already very high am@@ on@@ g@@ st farmers .
as a result , land aband@@ on@@ ment is to be expected ( He@@ ili@@ g 200@@ 2@@ a , b ) .
0 Land aband@@ on@@ ment is already a common phenomenon in regions where agricultural productivity is relatively low ( Bal@@ do@@ ck et al . , 1996 ) .
the situation is particularly wor@@ rying in central and eastern Europe , where political and economic change has negatively affected the conditions for far@@ ming ( E@@ EA , 2004 ) .
similar data sets for other countries are rare , since land aband@@ on@@ ment is not easily detec@@ ted in general agricultural statistics .

the black gro@@ use Tet@@ ra@@ o te@@ tri@@ x occur@@ s on gra@@ z@@ ed he@@ aths and mo@@ or@@ land , and is showing a rapid and almost Europe@@ wide decline ( T@@ uc@@ ker and he@@ ath , 1994 ) .
u@@ pl@@ and ha@@ bit@@ ats in the United Kingdom suffer from over@@ gra@@ z@@ ing and af@@ forest@@ ation , causing moderate population decline .
in low@@ land western Europe , this once rather common species is now practically ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t because of ha@@ bit@@ at destruction and agricultural intensi@@ fication .
in the Netherlands , for example , black gro@@ use numbers fell from several thousands in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s to less than 100 today ( see Ni@@ e@@ w@@ old , 1990 ) .
loss of extensive gr@@ ass@@ land ha@@ bit@@ at is reflected by the large @@@ -@@ @ scale decline of the cor@@ n@@ cr@@ ake Cre@@ x cre@@ x .
its numbers have fallen by more than 50 % in 10 countries .
dra@@ in@@ age of w@@ et gr@@ ass@@ lands , intensi@@ fication and the con@@ version of ha@@ y me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws into sil@@ age gr@@ ass@@ lands are the main causes ( T@@ uc@@ ker and he@@ ath , 1994 ) .
the cor@@ n@@ cr@@ ake is most common in central and eastern Europe , but ha@@ bit@@ at loss and population decline also occur@@ s
loss of semin@@ atural veget@@ ations is a consequence of the above agricultural trends . although many case studies exist ( see for example Ve@@ en and S@@ effer , 1999 ) , no reliable pan@@ European trend data are currently available for plant communities and ha@@ bit@@ ats .
the best data available are for birds .
far@@ m@@ land birds are indic@@ ative of overall bio@@ diversity , since they depend on a variety of plant and animal food and di@@ verse veget@@ ation structures for fe@@ eding , nes@@ ting and
the relatively small number of priority species in northern Europe does not necessarily reflect low nature value or absence of conserv@@ ation problems , since species rich@@ ness generally decreas@@ es with la@@ titu@@ de .

in Hungary , the great bu@@ st@@ ard population dropped from 2 500 individuals in 1985 to 1 100 individuals in 1990 ( F@@ é@@ sü@@ s et al . , 1992 ) .
reasons for this are intensified agricultural use of me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws and pas@@ tures , as well as increasing cultiv@@ ation of ma@@ ize and sun@@ flowers .
in the 1990s the Hungarian great bu@@ st@@ ard population was stable ( Far@@ ag@@ ó , 2003 ) .

they are either aimed at oblig@@ atory site protection or based on voluntary measures in the wider country@@ side .

the N@@ atur@@ a 2000 network will build on the proposed sites of commun@@ al interest ( p@@ SC@@ Is 5 ) that have been listed by the M@@ ember States .
out of the 19@@ 8 ha@@ bit@@ at types listed in An@@ ne@@ x I of the ha@@ bit@@ ats direc@@ tive , 28 require extensive agricultural management and can be regarded as high nature value far@@ m@@ land .
site protection
the main policy instruments for site protection at EU level are the birds

the average share of extensive agricultural ha@@ bit@@ ats within p@@ SC@@ Is is 15 % , even exceeding 50 % in parts of Spain and the United Kingdom ( see F@@ ig@@ ure 8 ) .
this under@@ lines their conserv@@ ation value .
the second pil@@ lar of the C@@ AP allows M@@ ember States to implement measures for allevi@@ ating or improving the ecological imp@@ acts of agriculture .
there is an array of measures that can be used to support environment@@ ally friendly far@@ ming systems .
however , the main elements relevant to high nature value far@@ m@@ land conserv@@ ation are agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes and less favoured area pay@@ ment@@ s@@ 6 .
the following sections will analy@@ se the geographical targeting of these policy measures .
Agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes
non@@ e@@ theless , less than one third of the high nature value far@@ m@@ land areas is covered by p@@ SC@@ Is ( see ap@@ pen@@ di@@ x B ) .
currently , there are no good monitoring data available about trends within the N@@ atur@@ a 2000 sites .
all in all , it can be concluded that the site protection measures will at best con@@ serve a minority of high nature value far@@ m@@ land .
under the current rural development regulation , adopted in 200@@ 37 , M@@ ember States are obliged to put agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes in place .
support can be granted to farmers for environment@@ ally favourable measures , including conserv@@ ation of high nature value far@@ med environ@@ ments which are under threat .
the C@@ AP is composed of two ' pil@@ lars ' .
the regulation is flexible , allowing M@@ ember States to design ta@@ il@@ or @@@ -@@ @ made sch@@ e@@ mes for regional environmental issues .
as a consequence , agri@@ environmental sch@@ e@@ mes are highly vari@@ able and generally not targeted at distinc@@ t geographical areas on the basis of com@@ mon@@ ly agreed criteria .
figure 9 shows the coverage of agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes in the EU M@@ ember States .
the level of implementation of agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes in the different countries var@@ ies considerably .
the first pil@@ lar is a commodi@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ based regime .
originally it was a market intervention mechanism , providing price guarantees , production incentives and export subsidies for certain crops and li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck products .
as such it was a cataly@@ st of agricultural productivity .
through successive reforms , the first pil@@ lar subsidies have become more and more dec@@ ou@@ pled from production .
subsidies are now provided through direct payments on the basis of historic production levels .
since the 2003 C@@ AP reform , first pil@@ lar payments are subject to environmental conditions .
the re@@ formed first pil@@ lar regime is less damaging to the environment , especially when providing incentives for far@@ ming in margin@@ al areas ( Hel@@ leg@@ ers and Go@@ de@@ sch@@ al@@ k , 1998 ) .
in general , there is no clear relationship between the overall agri@@ environment expendi@@ ture per hectar@@ e and the share of high nature value far@@ m@@ land ( F@@ ig@@ ure 10 , see ap@@ pen@@ di@@ x B for
share of u@@ til@@ ised agricultural area under agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes ( 1998 figures )

high nature value far@@ m@@ land : character@@ isti@@ cs , trends and policy challenges value far@@ m@@ land , provided that they do not create incentives for intensi@@ fication and particularly over@@ gra@@ z@@ ing .
the rece@@ ip@@ t of less favoured area support requires compliance with good far@@ ming practice as defined by M@@ ember States .
in addition , there are ce@@ il@@ ings on sto@@ cking den@@ si@@ ties in many regions , but these are o � en set at a level that is too high from a conserv@@ ation point of view .
for example , in France ce@@ il@@ ings of 1.8 li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck units per hectar@@ e apply in mountainous less favoured areas ( Bal@@ do@@ ck and Ben@@ ne � , 2002 ) .
details ) . countries with large areas of high nature value far@@ m@@ land , such as Spain , have small budgets per hectar@@ e for agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes .
although no precise data are available on geographical spending PA � er@@ ns within countries , the targeting of agri@@ environment measures at a European level seems far from op@@ ti@@ mal from a bio@@ diversity conserv@@ ation perspective .
furthermore , recent research shows that current agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes aimed at bio@@ diversity are not necessarily effective and that their monitoring is mostly insufficient ( Kle@@ in and Su@@ ther@@ land , 2003 ) .
less favoured areas
member States have considerable discre@@ tion both in the level of expendi@@ ture they commit and in the precise design of the less favoured area support payments .
figure 11 shows the distribution of designated less favoured areas .
they cover more than half the u@@ til@@ ised agricultural area in the EU , including all the higher and more mountainous ground .
some high nature value far@@ m@@ land is within the more productive areas outside less favoured areas , such as s@@ alt@@ mar@@ sh@@ es , w@@ et gr@@ ass@@ lands and ha@@ y me@@ ad@@ o@@ ws .
however , the great majority falls within the less favoured areas ( compar@@ e with F@@ ig@@ ure 4 ) .
farmers in less favoured areas are eligible for payments per hectar@@ e in addition to conventional C@@ AP support .
these compen@@ sat@@ ory payments have a combination of social and environmental objectives and are part of the second pil@@ lar of the C@@ AP .
they will generally increase prof@@ it@@ ability of far@@ ming in margin@@ al areas under natural constra@@ ints .
as such they are potentially an effective tool for preventing aband@@ on@@ ment of high nature

share of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land area ( % )
• High nature value far@@ m@@ land has been widely recognised as a valuable asset of the European country@@ side , providing ha@@ bit@@ at for a wide range of species .
maintaining a good conserv@@ ation status is key to reaching the 2010 target of hal@@ ting the loss of bio@@ diversity .
• O@@ ut@@ side protected areas , conserv@@ ation of high nature value far@@ m@@ land depends mainly on the application of instruments within the common agricultural policy , notably less favoured area support and agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes .
these instruments , however , do not appear to be well targeted at high nature value far@@ m@@ land areas .
southern European high nature value far@@ m@@ land areas in particular get relatively li � le support .
• High nature value far@@ m@@ land makes up about 15 @@@ -@@ @ 25 % of the u@@ til@@ ised agricultural area in Europe .
it is un@@ even@@ ly distributed , with concentr@@ ations in per@@ ip@@ h@@ eral parts of Europe .
• Over@@ all , the 2010 bio@@ diversity target is unlikely to be reached without additional policy efforts with regard to the conserv@@ ation of high nature value far@@ m@@ land .
• The conserv@@ ation status of high nature value far@@ m@@ land is in@@ sufficiently known , but case studies indicate serious bio@@ diversity decline .
the main threats are intensi@@ fication and aband@@ on@@ ment .
• S@@ ite protection under the birds and ha@@ bit@@ ats direc@@ tives is an appropriate but insufficient conserv@@ ation tool .
at best about one third of the high nature value far@@ m@@ land area will benefit from this measure .

in the maximum estimate all land cover classes with potential high nature value far@@ m@@ land were included .
in the minimum estimate only those land cover classes were included that have the highest prob@@ ability of containing high nature value far@@ m@@ land .
the map in F@@ ig@@ ure 4 is based on the minimum estimate .
farm system approach
the farm system clas@@ si@@ fication buil@@ ds on production , in@@ put and management character@@ isti@@ cs and distingu@@ is@@ hes the following main types :
• high nature value cro@@ pping systems : low inten@@ s@@ ity ar@@ able systems .
might have li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck , but this is not the dominant income source ;
type 1 and T@@ y@@ pe 2 areas are identified on the basis of land cover data ( Cor@@ ine database ) and ag@@ r@@ onom@@ ic and economic farm @@@ -@@ @ level data ( F@@ A@@ D@@ N ) .
combined , these two approaches give information on distribution and far@@ ming character@@ isti@@ cs .
due to data limit@@ ations this was possible for bre@@ eding birds only ( see An@@ der@@ sen , 2003 , for details on species selection and ag@@ gre@@ gation method ) .
it is not possible at this stage to mer@@ ge fully the different results into one map , or to produce separate maps for the different high nature value far@@ m@@ land types .
• high nature value off @@@ -@@ @ farm gra@@ z@@ ing systems : systems with ca � le , she@@ ep or go@@ ats gra@@ z@@ ing outside the farm , for example on common land ;
• high nature value permanent gr@@ ass@@ land systems : ca � le , she@@ ep or go@@ at systems where the main for@@ age resource is gr@@ ass from permanent or roug@@ h gr@@ ass@@ land ;
each of these approaches has its streng@@ ths and weaknesses .
the species approach suffers from data g@@ aps and should be regarded as an additional information source rather than a tool for de@@ lin@@ e@@ ating high nature value far@@ m@@ land .
high nature value ar@@ able gra@@ z@@ ing li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck systems : ca � le , she@@ ep or go@@ at systems where the main for@@ age resource is ar@@ able crops ;
concern were identified according to their global and European status , and the pro@@ portion of their total of their world population oc@@ curr@@ ing in Europe ( T@@ uc@@ ker , 1997 , see T@@ able A@@ 3 ) .
the SP@@ EC design@@ ation has become accepted as highligh@@ ting bird species of especially high conserv@@ ation concern .
anal@@ og@@ ous to the land cover approach , the farm system clas@@ si@@ fication was differ@@ enti@@ ated in a minimum and maximum vari@@ ant .
for the calc@@ ulations in this joint report only the minimum figures were used ( see also T@@ able A@@ 2 and F@@ ig@@ ure A1 ) .
species approach
a total of 1@@ 02 species were chosen for inclusion in the analy@@ ses .
this list included all category 1 @@@ -@@ @ 3 species which were considered to be potentially associated with far@@ m@@ land throughout Europe ( see An@@ der@@ sen , 2003 , and T@@ uc@@ ker , 1997 for details ) .
a cum@@ ula@@ tive distribution map was then drawn up on the basis of the EB@@ C@@ C At@@ las of European bre@@ eding Bir@@ ds ( Hag@@ eme@@ ij@@ er and Blair , 1997 ) .

this is a concep@@ tual graph , not directly der@@ ived from emp@@ iri@@ cal data .
hence the ax@@ es do not mention concrete vari@@ ables .
however , emp@@ iri@@ cal data that support this general relationship between agricultural inten@@ s@@ ity and bio@@ diversity do exist .
( 1995 ) presented a rather similar graph of the relationship between plant diversity and productivity , based on veget@@ ation research by Pe@@ et@@ ers et al . ( 1993 ) .
a second implic@@ ation of the graph in F@@ ig@@ ure 2 is that bio@@ diversity may gain from aband@@ on@@ ment in intensive systems .
this is consistent with the success of nature development in the Netherlands on former intensive agricultural land ( L@@ N@@ V , 2000 ; R@@ I@@ V@@ M , 2001 ) .
of course , the depic@@ ted relationship is simp@@ lified and scale dependent .
instead of generally reducing in@@ puts for increasing plant diversity , one might take smal@@ l@@ scale measures in intensive far@@ ming systems , such as leaving cer@@ e@@ al head@@ lands un@@ sp@@ ray@@ ed .
this can be effective for increasing the ab@@ und@@ ance of w@@ ild@@ life , such as we@@ eds , in@@ sec@@ ts and ga@@ me@@ birds ( Bo@@ at@@ man and Wilson , 1988 ) .
the more critical species , however , will not benefit .
this is why conserv@@ ation strategies should ide@@ ally be geo@@ graph@@ ically differ@@ enti@@ ated and ge@@ ar@@ ed to local circumstances .
figure 4@@ The map in F@@ ig@@ ure 4 is based on the minimum Cor@@ ine estimate ( see ap@@ pen@@ di@@ x A for details ) .
there is a need for future re@@ visions on the basis of up@@ dated and more detailed data , and for refin@@ ements on the basis of national dat@@ as@@ ets .
due to the limit@@ ations of the Cor@@ ine land cover data , T@@ y@@ pe 2 high nature value far@@ m@@ land ten@@ ds to be under@@ represented in the minimum estimate ( for example bo@@ c@@ age lands@@ cap@@ es in France ) .
type 3 far@@ m@@ land is also only partially included .
inten@@ sively used gr@@ ass@@ land may be important as w@@ inter@@ ing grounds for water@@ fo@@ w@@ l but these areas , mainly concentrated in low@@ land western Europe , do not show up on the map in F@@ ig@@ ure 4 .
land cover data do not indicate local pressures such as over@@ gra@@ z@@ ing .
for Finland and Sweden , the distribution PA � er@@ n of potential high nature value far@@ m@@ land is also optimistic due to interpre@@ tation
figure 8@@ F@@ ig@@ ure 8 was drawn up within the I@@ ren@@ a indicator project and buil@@ ds on data from the N@@ atur@@ a 2000 database of the European Top@@ ic Centre for Nat@@ ure Protection and Bi@@ odi@@ versity , Paris ( see also T@@ able B@@ 1 ) .
figure 9@@ A@@ n up@@ date for 2001 is available , but these figures include agri@@ environment sch@@ e@@ mes under Regula@@ tion 20@@ 78 / 92 and Regula@@ tion 12@@ 57 / 99 .
the data show an over@@ la@@ p in the area covered and hence include double counting .
for this reason the 1998 figures were used .
figure 10 / 12@@ The share of high nature value far@@ m@@ land of the u@@ til@@ ised agricultural area was calculated as the mean of the estimates on the basis of the land cover ( Cor@@ ine ) and farm system ( F@@ A@@ D@@ N ) approaches .
the estimates of U@@ A@@ A are according to Eurostat 2000 figures .
the official U@@ A@@ A figure for Greece is a gross under@@ estimate of total far@@ m@@ land , since the Com@@ m@@ ons are not included in the statistics .

the ' Environment for Europe ' process now brings together 56 countries across three contin@@ ents to jointly address environmental challenges .
in support of this process , the European Environment Agency has prepared a series of assessments of the environment for the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region to provide policy @@@ -@@ @ relevant , up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date and reliable information on the inter@@ actions between the environment and society .
the ir@@ st comprehensive assessment of the state of the pan @@@ -@@ @ European environment was presented in So@@ ia in 1995 .
up@@ dated assessments were presented at the Minist@@ erial Con@@ ferences in Aar@@ h@@ us in 1998 and Kiev in 2003 .
this is the fourth report in the series .
the report has been prepared in close partnership with a range of international organisations , governmental institutions and non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations across the region .
despite no@@ te@@ wor@@ thy progress in promoting environmental policy and sustainable development across the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region , an ' implementation gap ' in the use of integrated policy approaches remains .

successful implementation depends on the setting of clear and realistic targets together with mechanisms to monitor progress .
environmental information across the region still var@@ ies in quality , with the avail@@ ability and reli@@ ability of data differing considerably .
there is substantial room for further improvement in making much @@@ -@@ @ needed data and information not only acces@@ sible , but also more compar@@ able and reliable .
the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region har@@ bour@@ s rich cultural and environmental diversity .
this is in star@@ k contrast to the relatively spar@@ se populations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia , where the average den@@ s@@ ity is well below 20 people per square kilometre .
economic recovery in recent years has resulted in an increase , in relative terms , of national income in virtually all countries of the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region .
economic growth rates have been particularly high in South Eastern Europe ( SEE ) and E@@ EC@@ C@@ A countries .

increasingly , the economies of E@@ EC@@ C@@ A countries are moving away from reli@@ ance on agricultural output towards service industries .
non@@ e@@ theless , the E@@ EC@@ C@@ A region is still relatively more dependent on mineral extr@@ action and agriculture , often resulting in major environmental pressures and high vol@@ u@@ mes of was@@ tes .
the number of independent states in the region has increased from 33 in 1990 to 53 in 2007 , during which time the EU expanded from 15 to 27 M@@ ember States .

environment and health : soil
since the Kiev Conference , progress has been made both in policy development and in the avail@@ ability of information .
however , it is still too early to record any marked improvement in the status of soil resources .
given the complex@@ ity of current risks , especially climate change , new thinking on mechanisms to improve the evidence base to support action on so@@ ils is needed .
the exchange of best practices between countries and regions with similar soil conditions could reduce re@@ mediation costs across many soil threats , and provide an important basis for co@@ operation .

source : figure 2.@@ 4.@@ 2 of The fourth assessment .
environment and health : haz@@ ard@@ ous chem@@ ic@@ als
the chemical industry has been growing worldwide .
in the European Union the production of to@@ xic chem@@ ic@@ als has increased at almost the same rate as total chemical production , and both have grown faster than GDP .
globalisation is resulting in a shift of environmental bur@@ den@@ s to developing countries and the re @@@ -@@ @ import of haz@@ ards via trans@@ bo@@ und@@ ary pollution and cont@@ am@@ inated products .
recently , sig@@ ni@@ ic@@ ant new policies and legislation addressing the management of chem@@ ic@@ als have been agreed upon , both in Europe and g@@ lob@@ ally . for the EU , this includes the legislation on Reg@@ ist@@ r@@ ati on ,
evaluation and author@@ isation of Ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als ( reach ) , which entered into force in 2007 .
at the international level , the Strategic Ap@@ pro@@ ach to International Ch@@ em@@ ical Management ( SA@@ IC@@ M ) was adopted in 2006 .
emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es have increased in recent years in most European countries and are projected to continue to do so in the future .
many European countries have adopted national programmes to reduce emissions , but some of them will still have di@@ fic@@ ul@@ ties in reaching their K@@ yo@@ to targets .
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , under the UN Framework Convention on C@@ lim@@ ate Change , and its ir@@ st commitment period represent only a ir@@ st step in addressing climate change .

some un@@ avoi@@ dable climate change imp@@ acts are projected to affect most sectors of the economy and natural resources - even with strong m@@ iti@@ gation programmes .
it is therefore also urgent to adap@@ t to those imp@@ acts in developing and implementing policies and measures in all sectors of society .
bio@@ diversity decline and loss of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services continue to be a major concern across the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region .
in addition , the number of inv@@ asive ali@@ en species in the region continues to increase .
the Kiev Resolution 's over@@ ar@@ ching target of hal@@ t@@ ing@@ bio@@ diversity loss in the region by 2010 will not be@@ achieved without considerable additional efforts and resources .
communication , education and public awareness programmes , however , are being implemented according to the Kiev Resolution .

environmental concerns are becoming increasingly integrated into the forest@@ ry and agricultural sectors .
non@@ e@@ theless , agriculture still ex@@ er@@ ts considerable pressure on bio@@ diversity .
Mar@@ ine and coastal environment
E@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ation remains a problem in all en@@ closed seas and shel@@ tered mar@@ ine waters across the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region .
reducing di@@ ff@@ use nut@@ ri@@ ent sources , particularly from agriculture , remains a major challenge and requires increased action .
Over@@ ishing is still widespread in all pan ‑ European seas .
improved policies and stricter law enforcement are needed for ish stock recovery - especially to stop illegal ishing , but also to reduce the imp@@ acts of is@@ her@@ ies on the whole mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem .

climate change is likely to affect seas and co@@ asts , including mar@@ ine organis@@ ms .
adap@@ tation policies should include measures to reduce other , non @@@ -@@ @ clim@@ atic pressures in order to increase the res@@ ili@@ ence of mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems and the coastal zone to climate change .
actions under regional sea conven@@ tions and EU policies have improved water quality in the western seas , for example with regard to some haz@@ ard@@ ous substan@@ ces .
policies ge@@ ar@@ ed towards improving the generally poor state of Europe 's mar@@ ine and coastal environment should be based on an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem approach .
sustainable consumption and production
the concept of sustainable consumption and production has become more prominent on the policy agenda since the Kiev Conference .
however , few concrete out@@ comes have emerged , and implementation strategies and tools to measure environmental imp@@ acts need to be put in place .
per capita resource use levels have remained stable in all regions over recent years , and some dec@@ ou@@ pling has been achieved between resource use and economic growth .
pat@@ ter@@ ns of consumption are changing rapidly , driven by soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic changes .
the consumption categories causing the highest life @@@ -@@ @ cycle environmental imp@@ acts are food and be@@ ver@@ ages , private transport , and housing .
in the EU , tourism and air travel are emerging as key areas of future imp@@ acts .
the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region is gener@@ ating ever more waste .
Land@@ ill , environment@@ ally the least preferred option , is still the most common method of waste management across the pan ‑ European region .
EU M@@ ember States have made some progress in limiting the share of municipal waste going to land@@ ill .
many E@@ EC@@ C@@ A and SEE countries have developed waste strategies and legislation for waste , but these still need to be implemented effectively .
source : figure 6.@@ 20 of The fourth assessment .
proper waste collection and safe lan@@ dil@@ ling remain a challenge .
in some E@@ EC@@ C@@ A countries an even bigger challenge is ensuring the environmental safety and clean @@@ -@@ @ up of haz@@ ard@@ ous waste sites inherited from the past .
modern , intensive agriculture often has a negative impact through its use and pollution of air , water and soil .
on the other hand , far@@ ming still plays a positive role in preserving Europe 's lands@@ cap@@ es and bio@@ diversity .
the area of ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated land in the southern EU ‑ 15 and SEE has increased , showing a continuing trend of agricultural intensi@@ ic@@ ation .
ir@@ ri@@ gation has of@@ te n caused dec@@ lines in water resources and quality , sal@@ in@@ isation and land de@@ grad@@ ation - especially in southern and eastern E@@ EC@@ C@@ A .
most of SEE and E@@ EC@@ C@@ A will require continued international support to achieve better environmental management of the agricultural sector .
source : figure 7.@@ 1.1 of The fourth assessment .
international tourist arri@@ vals in the pan @@@ -@@ @ European region continue to grow .
co@@ asts , islands and mountains remain particularly sensitive to tourism development .
de@@ grad@@ ation , sometimes irreversible , has already occurred in some popular mass @@@ -@@ @ tourism destinations .
the imp@@ acts of tourism are projected to grow as a result of increasing af@@ lu@@ ence and lif@@ estyle and demographic changes .
tourist behaviour remains a crucial factor for the sustainability of the sector .

energy consumption and green@@ house gas emissions from transport in SEE and W@@ CE are growing rapidly along with the general growth in transport .
co emissions per capita in W@@ CE continue to be two
2 to four times higher than in SEE and E@@ EC@@ C@@ A .
developing competitive urban transport solutions is away of igh@@ ting tra@@ fic con@@ ges@@ tion and air quality problems as well as improving transport safety .
for public transport to become competitive , cities need to be planned and developed with public transport in mind .

E@@ EA in brief environment and resources .
the E@@ EA is an important source and cust@@ o@@ dian of environment@@ related data and indicators and a key provider of environmental knowledge and information services .
the European Environment Agency ( E@@ EA ) is a European public body dedicated to providing objective , reliable and compar@@ able information on the environment .
the aim of the E@@ EA is to ensure that decision @@@ -@@ @ makers and the general public are kept informed about the state and outlook of the environment .
the E@@ EA works in partnership with government departments and agencies , international conven@@ tions and UN bodies , the scientific community , private sector and civil society .
the decision to locate the Agency in Copenhagen was taken in 1993 and the E@@ EA became operational in 1994 .
the founding regulation sets out a number of tasks ( Article 2 ) and priority areas ( Article 3 ) for the E@@ EA ; these are addressed through its multi @@@ -@@ @ annual and annual work programmes .
the E@@ EA under@@ takes a comprehensive range of integrated environmental and them@@ atic assessments .
the E@@ EA strategy 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 is the fourth Mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ annual Wor@@ k Programme of the Agency ; it was adopted by the E@@ EA Management Board through written procedure following its 5@@ 2nd meeting on 26 November 2008 .
E@@ EA Strategy 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 - Mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ annual Wor@@ k Programme
to become recognised as the world 's leading body for the provision of ti@@ mely , relevant and acces@@ sible European en@@ vi@@ ro@@ mental data , information , knowledge and assessments .
chairman of the E@@ EA Management Board
integrated environmental assessments and anticip@@ ating new thinking , especially about ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services , eco @@@ -@@ @ efficiency and emerging technologies and innov@@ ations will play a key role in shap@@ ing European environmental policies .
well designed environmental policies are necessary and positive for our society and economy .
the E@@ EA will continue to work closely with neighbouring countries , in particular the West Balkan region .
it also illu@@ strated that for successful implementation of environmental policies we need to engage at a global and regional level with all actors .
over the last few years environment policy questions have again moved up the political agenda , which is lasting proof of the E@@ EA 's work , and that its contribution is now more relevant than ever .
the E@@ EA is well placed to further develop its role as a provider of independent and assured environmental information .
in addition , and looking to the next five years , I would like to highlight some of the E@@ EA 's strategic issues .
this new Strategy will continue to support the aims of the Environment Action Program@@ mes of the EU .
thus climate change , nature and bio@@ diversity , environment and health as well as natural resources and waste will continue to be at the at the centre of the work of the E@@ EA .
the new Strategy will also take forward the Shar@@ ed Environmental Information System ( SE@@ IS ) .
chairman of the E@@ EA Scientific Committee
the 5 @@@ -@@ @ year State of Environment reports and the pan @@@ -@@ @ European assessments produced by the Agency have helped shape the priorities of the research framework programmes .
the context in which the E@@ EA works is fast evol@@ ving .
it is therefore important to gr@@ as@@ p the opportunities affor@@ ded by new developments , such as G@@ M@@ ES and other large scale ob@@ servation initiatives .
these are likely to modi@@ fy pro@@ found@@ ly the way in which data , information and indicators are provided .
the Agency covers a wide environmental agenda and keeps a close eye on emerging trends .
it also has a key role to play in ensuring the appropriate connection between discussions taking place in scientific and political aren@@ as .
the newly elected Chairman of the E@@ EA Scientific Committee is D@@ r D@@ et@@ le@@ f S@@ prin@@ z .
the Scientific Committee welcomes the new E@@ EA Mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ annual Wor@@ k Programme for the period 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 as a comprehensive and well @@@ -@@ @ balanced document .
this inter@@ disciplinary approach is placed at the heart of the programme through a number of cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting themes and integrated environmental assessments the Agency will undertake .
the E@@ EA Executive Director affected by exposure to high levels of ozone and parti@@ c@@ ulate matter is growing as urban areas expand .
access to near @@@ -@@ @ real @@@ -@@ @ time ozone data is now possible via the E@@ EA 's ozone web , and is being introduced to doctors and hospitals to provide an al@@ er@@ ting system for vulnerable individuals .
new ways of identi@@ fying emerging environmental problems
this E@@ EA Strategy outlines our plans for the next five years .
it is shap@@ ed around today 's and tomorrow 's information needs with an overall emphasis on a much wider use of the environmental information that is being collected .
we are stream@@ lining our activities , creating new ways of working , and developing new methods to bring environmental thinking into the mainstream of economic and social policy @@@ -@@ @ making .
new ways of interpre@@ ting environmental information
anticip@@ ating the types of information that policy @@@ -@@ @ makers , industry and citizens will need to make decisions in the future is extremely important .
through our newly form@@ at@@ ted publication S@@ ign@@ als , we will bring to the attention of our readers those issues that we consider likely to we@@ igh heavily on the agenda for the coming year .
typical examples where the E@@ EA worked in advance of public demand are ag@@ ro@@ fuels , energy subsidies , the valu@@ ation of ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services and elec@@ tro @@@ -@@ @ mag@@ ne@@ tic radi@@ ation .
our work is based on the precautionary principle , evaluation of the burden of evidence , decision @@@ -@@ @ making under var@@ ying degrees of uncertainty and the use of decision @@@ -@@ @ support models and scenarios .
over the next five years we will create a simple cal@@ cul@@ us to allow us to anticipate the potential environmental imp@@ acts ar@@ ising from today 's and tomorrow 's social and economic drivers .
new ways of working
at the E@@ EA , we will be building the equivalent of official statistics for ecological services and environmental assets ; to set alongside the traditional assets of our economy .
in the future we will be able to demonstrate how companies and governments can em@@ bed ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services to restructure the global economy .
new ways of using environmental information
people need up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date information on their environment . for example , the number of people
as more and more people become convinced about the importance of the environment in their lives , the demand for reliable local information has grown explos@@ iv@@ ely .
providing information through the E@@ EA 's networks has been a unique and positive experience .
using up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date technologies and software , we have been able to capit@@ alise on the scientific advances in monitoring and ob@@ servation .
more quickly than any well @@@ -@@ @ designed sam@@ pling programme .
combin@@ ing these sources of evidence within the formal world of assessment and analysis will become very important .
the E@@ EA has been extending and building its networks and sources for obser@@ ving and knowledge @@@ -@@ @ gathering through its global citizen environment observatory .
our goal
we aim to achieve this over the next five years by :
• continuing to support implementation of Europe 's environmental legislation through analy@@ ses and assessments of Europe 's environment ;
• ensuring continuous access to high quality environmental data , information and services ;
today , the majority of Europeans agree that the environment has a significant impact on their quality of life and that global trends play a significant part in this .
businesses are also seeking greater innovation and eco @@@ -@@ @ efficiency to achieve higher environmental standards and maintain their competitiveness in the economy .
• producing integrated environmental assessments and forward studies for Europe increasingly in the global context ;
• addressing critical environmental priorities as they arise on the policy agenda ;
• improving communications and dis@@ sem@@ ination to decision @@@ -@@ @ makers and citizens via multi @@@ -@@ @ media , us@@ er @@@ -@@ @ friendly , multi@@ lin@@ gual information .
many of these improvements have been delivered through implementation of the environmental acquis commun@@ aut@@ aire .
at the same time , citizens remain concerned about climate change , the quality of air they bre@@ a@@ the , how to deal with waste and the imp@@ acts of chem@@ ic@@ als .
they have many questions about what is happening to the environment and how it will affect them and future generations .
our strategy for 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013
our new strategy is built on three main activities :
• continuing to support the information needs set down in EU and international environmental legislation and especially its 6th Environment Action Programme ;
the last few years have seen a growing awareness of environmental change and the need for urgent policy action .
this in turn has led to an explosive growth of environmental initiatives and institutions .
• improving the Co@@ ordination and dis@@ sem@@ ination of environmental data and knowledge across Europe .
this strategy document describes the E@@ EA 's activities under four areas :
the E@@ EA 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013 Strategy is the fourth Mul@@ ti @@@ -@@ @ annual Wor@@ k Programme .
it buil@@ ds upon the successful delivery of our previous strategy for 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 2008 , which was based on the key priorities of the 6th Environment Action Programme and established the Agency as a key provider in Europe of environmental data , information and knowledge .
• In@@ tegrated environmental assessment
• Information services and communications .
the 2008 effectiveness evaluation of the E@@ EA stated that ' The Agency is ... the most efficient way to deliver the products and services required by the stak@@ ehol@@ ders . ...
it is difficult to see ... how the provision of im@@ partial and reliable information , could be performed through any of the possible other mechanisms available for European organisations ' .
the 2008 evaluation also gave a number of recommendations on priority setting and dis@@ sem@@ ination .
these have been acted on in defining the future priorities and shape of Agency 's resources .
our strategic objectives are to :
• play a key role in the development and implementation of European environment policies and related areas , especially the European Commission 's Environment Action Programme ;
• monitor the effectiveness of environmental policies of EU and member countries of the E@@ EA and in candidate and potential candidate countries ;
• support the monitoring of the EU S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able Development Strategy ( through assistance for the S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able Development Indic@@ ators ) focusing on core environment@@ related issues ;
• anticipate new ideas and thinking , especially about ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services , resource use and emerging technologies and innov@@ ations and behavi@@ our@@ al changes ;
• develop new web @@@ -@@ @ based services for environmental educational needs ;
• help ensure , through effective communications and information services , that environmental thinking is brought into the mainstream of decision @@@ -@@ @ making and the daily lives of European citizens .
our key actions for 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013
in 2011 we will ... • support environmental reporting within the European Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ; • complete a cost of in@@ action related valu@@ ation of damage to ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems services and human welfare .
in 2012 we will ... • produce an assessment of Europe 's ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services - Eu@@ rec@@ a 2012 ; • support the EU @@@ -@@ @ wide review of the status of water and ground@@ water environ@@ ments through wise .
in 2013 we will ... • support the review of the environmental out@@ comes of the 6th Environment Action Programme and the EU S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able Development Strategy .
our networks and governance
E@@ ion@@ et is widely acknowledged for its support of multiple forms of co@@ operation and a positive example of institutional and technical partnership .
the E@@ EA is govern@@ ed by a Management Board made up of its member countries , and representatives from the European Parliament and the European Commission .
the Bureau is made up of the Cha@@ ir and Vice chairs of the Management Board .
each member country has a management board member supported by a national fo@@ cal point and a number of national reference centres and principal contact points .
the E@@ EA has a Scientific Committee , made up of independent experts from the field of environment , including social scientists and sec@@ toral specialists .
the Committee offers advice to E@@ EA staff and gives opinions on different issues .
E@@ ion@@ et - the European environment information and obser@@ ving network , covering 39 member and co@@ operating countries - is the unique partnership between the E@@ EA and its member countries and is central to the E@@ EA 's networking activities .
in all there are nearly 400 people involved in E@@ ion@@ et .
we will undertake this area of work through the strategic area :
• E@@ EA governance and partnerships .
national fo@@ cal points
making it happen
the E@@ EA draws its staff from across the 32 member countries .
it also has a number of national experts .
we aim to maxim@@ ise the agency 's resources for our environmental work by :
• achieving our E@@ M@@ AS environmental goals every year ;
• re@@ organising to make the Agency more respon@@ sive and flexible ;
the topic centres are distributed across the E@@ EA member countries .
• avoiding du@@ p@@ lic@@ ation with other EU institutions ;
• li@@ a@@ ising with staff across the European Commission on our them@@ atic work and to ensure administrative consist@@ ency ;
• making best use of all European funded environmental actions ;
the Environmental D@@ ata Cent@@ res include climate change , water , air , bio@@ diversity , and land use ( managed by E@@ EA ) , forests and so@@ ils ( managed by J@@ RC ) and waste , natural resources and products ( managed by Eurostat ) .
• continuing to maxim@@ ise staff avail@@ ability and efficiency by focusing on health and wel@@ l@@ being .
our Mak@@ ing it happen activities will be carried through the strategic area :
• E@@ EA internal management and administration .
in the Agency we strive to give value for money across an enormous environmental agenda .
this is essential in today 's climate of increased financial pressure and the growing number of organisations working on environmental issues .

we will achieve our objective by :
cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting themes
• paying special attention to issues that are priorities for the SO@@ E@@ R 2010 , Eu@@ rec@@ a 2012 and IP@@ C@@ C 2013 ; and
demand for cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting integrated analy@@ ses is growing in recognition of rapidly changing re@@ alities .
the requirement for connected information on all these processes is growing as a result .
in a global@@ ised economy where individuals , businesses and governments can ex@@ ert a global reach , many different types of policy can affect the res@@ ili@@ ence of the natural environment and the resources it provides whether on land or at sea .
• building al@@ li@@ ances and capacities within our networks to undertake such cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting analy@@ ses and assessments within the context of SE@@ IS .
the work is divided into the ten major cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting themes that occur across the European Union 's political and environmental landscape :
many uncertain@@ ties under@@ lie these re@@ alities and how they may play out .
but it is clear that environment and economy have not been equal partners in this relationship .
General objective for 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2013
to support policy development and evaluation within the cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting themes by :
• C@@ lim@@ ate change imp@@ acts • vulner@@ ability and adap@@ tation • E@@ cos@@ y@@ stems • Environment and health • Mar@@ itime • S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able consumption and production and waste • Land use • Agriculture and forest@@ ry • Energy • Transport
climate change imp@@ acts on natural resources and human activities are expected to continue despite strong action to reduce green@@ house gas emissions .
climate change is an additional pressure on natural and human systems , which are already under increasing pressures from globalisation and rising consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns across the world .
• working with research teams across Europe to improve the regi@@ on@@ alisation of forward studies of climate change imp@@ acts ;
the conclusions were that in every aspect , the changes associated with climate change were widespread and increasing .
data from the various global obser@@ ving and in @@@ -@@ @ sit@@ u meas@@ urement programmes also show that we are experiencing conditions outside the most p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic estimates from the IP@@ C@@ C 2007 report .
• creating multi @@@ -@@ @ media , us@@ er @@@ -@@ @ friendly , multi@@ lin@@ gual products on the extent of climate change imp@@ acts .
vulner@@ ability of natural resources and human activities is increasing in Europe as a consequence of climate change .
• reporting on national climate adap@@ tation plans and provide gu@@ idance and support for information exchange on regional prevention , management and adap@@ tation strategies and best practice ;
under the UN F@@ C@@ C@@ C , a 5 @@@ -@@ @ year work programme on imp@@ acts , vulner@@ ability and adap@@ tation is being implemented .
a global post @@@ -@@ @ K@@ yo@@ to regime is being developed including adap@@ tation to climate change , with agreement planned for end of 2009 in Copenhagen .

• increasing awareness about the value and use of natural resources through analy@@ ses of market @@@ -@@ @ based mechanisms for ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems services ;
• improving knowledge about th@@ res@@ holds and res@@ ili@@ ence in Europe 's ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems and in particular in relation to climate change e@@ .@@ g@@ . car@@ bon absorption , tro@@ p@@ hic dynam@@ ics , provisi@@ oning and frag@@ ment@@ ation of the landscape ;
• up@@ dating E@@ EA indicator fra@@ me@@ works , including SE@@ BI@@ 2010 , using an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems services approach and integrate them into the E@@ EA assessments ; and
2.@@ 4 Environment and health
there will also be an emphasis on studies that highlight the need for early action and on the benefits of preven@@ tive and precautionary measures .
mid @@@ -@@ @ term evalu@@ ations of these programmes recognised the progress made but indicated strongly the need for intensive work in the future .
• providing in@@ puts for all major E@@ EA assessments , including SO@@ E@@ R 2010 and Eu@@ rec@@ a 2012 , its regional assessments , and various international reports and assessments such as the UN Environment for Europe Minist@@ erial Conference ;
they also called for information on environmental determin@@ ants with positive health imp@@ acts such as bio@@ di@@ verse environ@@ ments , non @@@ -@@ @ motor@@ ised means of transport and housing conditions .

• undertaking analy@@ ses on mar@@ ine ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems accounting in relation to maritime soci@@ o @@@ -@@ @ economic activities ;
new and more extensive monitoring and analy@@ tical methods are now needed for integrated assessments .
these will help connect source organisations and provide online and shared access to the necessary data , to support mar@@ ine sp@@ ati@@ al planning and state of the environment reporting .
• creating us@@ er @@@ -@@ @ friendly access to reports , data , indicators and other information through the E@@ EA Water D@@ ata Centre , with related analy@@ tical tools .
2.@@ 6 S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able consumption and production and waste
• strengthening efforts , in close co@@ operation with Eurostat , J@@ RC , OECD and the UN , to further develop integrated economic and environmental accounts ;
• undertaking analy@@ ses on Life Cy@@ cle Anal@@ y@@ sis , resource avail@@ ability and productivity , clean@@ er production and eco @@@ -@@ @ efficient products ;

• working with business and SM@@ E@@ s to share experiences and good practice on sustainable business strategies , corporate social responsibility , E@@ M@@ AS and the role of retailers ;
it is also reflected in the increased business focus on corporate social responsibility , efficiency in resource use and environmental management systems , and the greater focus on sustainable consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns across Europe .
• strengthening work on sustainable production and eco @@@ -@@ @ innovation , in co@@ operation with OECD ;
• producing and maintaining indicators on sustainable consumption and production , waste and resources via SE@@ IS and the Environmental D@@ ata Cent@@ res of Eurostat ;
• improving communication with policy @@@ -@@ @ makers and consumers on how to limit environmental imp@@ acts of consumption , and develop options for more sustainable products and production .
• supporting the implementation of the EU Action Plan on SC@@ P , EU them@@ atic strategies , national SC@@ P policies , the global Mar@@ rak@@ ech process on SC@@ P and the UN@@ C@@ SD review of SC@@ P through
2.7 Land use
• working with ES@@ P@@ O@@ N@@ 2013 to define and test a new set of territorial indicators to support sp@@ ati@@ al planning and understanding of different development per@@ spec@@ tives ;
• supporting the development of the G@@ M@@ ES Land services and Global obser@@ ving Sy@@ stems ; and
2.8 Agriculture and forest@@ ry
to provide integrated analy@@ ses of land use trends in agriculture and forest@@ ry through assessments of their current and future impact on water , so@@ ils , air quality , bio@@ diversity and lands@@ cap@@ es .
the use of agricultural and forest@@ ry land in Europe for producing primary material ( food , fe@@ ed , bi@@ om@@ ass for energy and material purposes ) will become more intensive in the coming decades .
this der@@ ives from new demands , advances in technology ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ atic di@@ ges@@ tion of cel@@ lul@@ os@@ ic material , engineering of food properties , cro@@ p bre@@ eding including gen@@ e@@ tically modi@@ fied organis@@ ms et@@ c . ) and changes in far@@ ming practices .
forest@@ ry and agriculture increasingly deliver into shared end uses for buildings , energy and bi@@ om@@ ater@@ i@@ als , which lead to higher demands on the available land area .
the expected imp@@ acts of climate change and land con@@ version for the urban and service sectors will increase resulting pressures on water and soil resources as well as affect bio@@ diversity , lands@@ cap@@ es and air quality .
the E@@ EA has worked on AG@@ RI -@@ environment indicators , developed the concept of high nature value far@@ m@@ land and investigated policy integration , e@@ .@@ g@@ . with regard to bio@@ energy production .
• providing regular up@@ dates on energy and environment indicators , including energy subsidies , and in@@ puts to the E@@ EA integrated assessments ; and
energy policy will continue to play a central role in combating climate change while at the same time ensuring a secure supply of energy in Europe .
further efforts are also being made in energy efficiency , reducing energy demand , advan@@ cing the establishment of a true internal energy market , stimu@@ la@@ ting energy research and technology development and enhancing international co@@ operation on energy issues .
European efforts in this area are tigh@@ tly coup@@ led to those in the rest of the world .
to assess the imp@@ acts of transport on human health and the environment with the help of transport and environment indicators , models and scenarios .
this will include , inter alia , tr@@ acking progress towards environment@@ ally related policy targets for transport and seeking to demonstrate possible new solutions for access and sustainable mo@@ bility .
transport is an integral part of most of the activities that together form the basis of a nation 's G@@ ross Do@@ me@@ stic Pro@@ duc@@ t .
the EU is therefore considering a range of policies and measures such as inclusion of aviation in
• producing indicator @@@ -@@ @ based assessments of the transport sector 's progress in integr@@ ating environmental consider@@ ations into its policies as in@@ put to E@@ EA 's regular integrated and cross @@@ -@@ @ cutting assessments ; the EU emis@@ sion trading system ; reducing C@@ O@@ 2
• analy@@ sing traffic 's contribution to air quality and no@@ ise in Europe 's cities ; emissions from cars ; and infrastructure charging sch@@ e@@ mes .
however , we should avoid transport being only associated with climate change ; the Gre@@ ening Transport package is a step in broad@@ ening out the discussion .
• building geo@@ graph@@ ically specific transport emis@@ sion invent@@ ories ;
to a large degree transport policy development is gui@@ ded by the aim of creating a more ' sustainable transport system ' , with access and mo@@ bility at its heart .
but as yet these terms are not operational and do not facilitate environmental improvements .
in response to the increasingly ambitious green@@ house gas emis@@ sion targets there is a need to develop sector specific targets .
integrated environmental assessment
to ensure that these assessments support decision @@@ -@@ @ making processes and policy development , increasing emphasis will be given to four elements :
these assessments are needed to help frame , support and evaluate the progress of a wide range of policy processes .
there is also an increased demand to include economic information , forward looking per@@ spec@@ tives and to address uncertain@@ ties .
however , this growth in the number and diversity of assessments is leading to ine@@ ffici@@ encies , over@@ la@@ ps and in@@ cons@@ isten@@ cies , which can undermine their effectiveness .
• integrated environmental policy analysis and assessments of national and regional policies and actions to secure the environment e@@ .@@ g@@ . in transport and infrastructure , agriculture ( bio@@ technologies and trans@@ gen@@ ic organis@@ ms ) energy and industry ( sustainable production and consumption and nano@@ technologies ) and in the finance ( insurance ) , and commerce ( distribution ) ;
• decision @@@ -@@ @ making under conditions of risk , uncertainty and complex@@ ity and the use of decision support tools ;
• providing more social and economic analy@@ ses to help put the inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness of the environment into the mainstream of soci@@ et@@ al thinking ; and
• intensi@@ fying the use of scenarios and other forward looking methods to support the development of sustainable fut@@ ures .
in line with its founding Regula@@ tion , the E@@ EA is required to publish every five years a report of the state and outlook of the European Environment .
the next report is due in 2010 .
the activities under this strategic area are found under five themes :
over the next five years , the E@@ EA will deliver its main five @@@ -@@ @ year reporting and assessment and with partners develop and contribute to other regional , pan @@@ -@@ @ European and global assessments .
it will also aim to provide a strong basis for the EU Environment Action Programme .
3.@@ 1 In@@ tegrated environmental assessment
the next state and outlook of the environment report is due in 2010 .
the reports contribute to strategic environment@@ related policy @@@ -@@ @ making at the European level , the evaluation of EU environmental action programmes and strategies and to future agenda setting .
• improving communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the assessment via multi @@@ -@@ @ media , us@@ er @@@ -@@ @ friendly , multi@@ lin@@ gual information ;
recognising the wide interest in the SO@@ E@@ R 2010 , differ@@ enti@@ ated products and multi@@ media will be designed to suit the different audiences , including assessments on them@@ atic issues and at country levels .
3.2 Regional and global assessment
• co@@ operating with Mediterranean Action Programme , Eurostat and other partners to organise a regular reporting process under Hor@@ iz@@ on 2020 , publishing five @@@ -@@ @ ye@@ arly and bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al reports on the Mediterranean environment ;
• planning and preparing the fifth pan @@@ -@@ @ European assessment report ;
common geographical and environmental pat@@ ter@@ ns character@@ ise specific areas in Europe , such as coastal regions or mountain ran@@ ges .
they correspon@@ d on the one hand to the reality of Europe 's landscape diversity and , on the other , to some form of targeted processes and policies or more generally territorial co@@ hesion .
the E@@ EA is involved in the production of a number of regional assessments and State of Environment reporting processes .
• participating in the UN@@ G@@ A assessment of assessments for the mar@@ ine environment , UN@@ EP @@@ -@@ @ ge@@ o , other UN@@ EP DE@@ W@@ A activities and other UN assessments via expert groups and chairmanship of pan@@ els ;
• identi@@ fying the needs for and providing specific ta@@ il@@ or @@@ -@@ @ made assessments on the state of the Ar@@ c@@ tic environment ;
• improving communication and dis@@ sem@@ ination on the importance and basis of integrated assessment via multi @@@ -@@ @ media , us@@ er @@@ -@@ @ friendly , multi@@ lin@@ gual information .
3.3 Dec@@ ision support
• promoting long @@@ -@@ @ term monitoring of surprise @@@ -@@ @ sensitive parame@@ ters so as to better anticipate per@@ tur@@ b@@ ations in biological and health systems ;
• expl@@ oring di@@ verse methods for achieving effective public participation in identi@@ fying and managing emerging ecological and health issues ;
• developing and using decision support tools in key areas , such as climate change , adap@@ tation , ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem valu@@ ation and vulner@@ ability assessments ;
there is growing scientific awareness that environmental , ecological and health issues are more complex , multi @@@ -@@ @ ca@@ usal and inter @@@ -@@ @ connected than previously understood .
• improving and simplif@@ ying the termin@@ ology used to character@@ ise cause @@@ -@@ @ effect relationships and uncertain@@ ties in ecological and biological systems , by fostering the widespread adoption of such termin@@ ology ;
• developing with partners a better understanding of the types of juris@@ pru@@ dence that will properly reflect the needs of the environment ; and
• improving awareness of these issues via workshops with a broad range of stak@@ ehol@@ ders .
central to these activities will be the maintenance of data re@@ pos@@ it@@ ories .
• developing integrated analysis of economic drivers and environmental problems and policy tools ;
• building invent@@ ories and assessments of the role of market @@@ -@@ @ based solutions and environmental tax reforms ;
there is an increasing focus on economic damage and welfare loss in the case of inadequate action or in@@ action .
at the same time policies and measures must indu@@ ce effective and least @@@ -@@ @ cost solutions .
market @@@ -@@ @ based instruments are increasingly recognised as potentially cost @@@ -@@ @ saving tools , and environmental tax reform aims to reconc@@ ile environmental , fiscal and social objectives .
• making cost of in@@ action related valu@@ ations of market and non @@@ -@@ @ market damage to ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem services and human welfare as in@@ put into European eco @@@ -@@ @ assessment programmes ;
• performing integrated analy@@ ses of environmental consequences and resources efficiency of main driving forces and of solutions with focus on market @@@ -@@ @ based approaches , such as car@@ bon markets and environmental taxation ;
• carrying out an analysis of environmental tax reform as a response to long @@@ -@@ @ term sustainable reconciliation of environmental , economic / fiscal and social objectives ; and
• further developing meth@@ od@@ olo@@ gies , including benefit transfer , for scal@@ ing up of non @@@ -@@ @ market valu@@ ation case study results , and valu@@ ation in land and ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem accounting .
• continuing to support ongoing E@@ EA assessment processes and especially the future analysis for the SO@@ E@@ R 2010 , and for the European ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem Ass@@ ess@@ ment ( Eu@@ rec@@ a 2012 ) ;
• fostering the use of scenarios and now@@ casting techniques in strategic decision @@@ -@@ @ making by developing guidelines , best @@@ -@@ @ practice and web @@@ -@@ @ based training tools ;
• initi@@ ating new forward looking / scenario assessments in specific areas , regions and topics ;
following the analysis presented in the 1999 five @@@ -@@ @ year state and outlook report , and the amended Regula@@ tion , the E@@ EA was requested to integrate a forward @@@ -@@ @ looking component into its assessments .
• further expl@@ oring the current use imp@@ acts and effectiveness of scenarios in strategic environmental decision @@@ -@@ @ making ;
• further developing information systems via SE@@ IS for forward looking information and developing better ta@@ il@@ ored tools to manage forward @@@ -@@ @ looking information ; and
consequently , the E@@ EA work was expanded beyond the SO@@ E@@ R reports , into them@@ atic areas and beyond existing legislation and the borders of the Europe .
during the last strategy period , the main bul@@ k of work cons@@ isted of the wide assessment processes involved in the 2005 five @@@ -@@ @ year state and outlook report and for the 2007 ' Environment for Europe ' Belgrade Conference .
in addition , contributions were made to the UN@@ EP Global Environmental O@@ ut@@ look process .
information services and communications
the aim is to provide products and services with a high read@@ ability , us@@ ability and message consist@@ ency for the E@@ EA 's multi@@ lin@@ gual us@@ er community .
the demand for easy to understand , up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date information has grown significantly even during the course of the 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 2008 strategy .
this demand comes from both political decision @@@ -@@ @ makers and from European citizens , who increasingly wish to see full transparency with respect to information provided by public bodies .
alongside this development , the rapid evol@@ ution in new information technologies provides us with tools to communicate more effectively .
the website will evol@@ ve from one that stores documents into an inter@@ active site and portal that supports two @@@ -@@ @ way communications and can be effective in helping to improve the quality and spread of environmental education .
work in this strategic area will be under two themes :
4.@@ 1 Shar@@ ed Environmental Information System
E@@ EA and E@@ ion@@ et will work together with the European Commission and other international stak@@ ehol@@ ders to implement the system .
SE@@ IS is a distributed , integrated , web @@@ -@@ @ enabled information system based on a network of public information providers sharing environmental data and information .
it is built on existing e @@@ -@@ @ infrastructure , systems and services in the M@@ ember States and EU institutions , especially those of the E@@ EA and E@@ ion@@ et .
• developing applications and services related to air , mar@@ ine and ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al environmental monitoring and ob@@ serv@@ ations using improved in @@@ -@@ @ sit@@ u and space @@@ -@@ @ based monitoring der@@ ived from G@@ M@@ ES and ge@@ o / G@@ E@@ OS@@ S ;
it will provide easily acces@@ sible information to both policy @@@ -@@ @ makers and citizens .
• ensuring system maintenance and management , providing high quality 24 / 7 data and information services ; and
• continu@@ ously improving our E@@ EA website , as main portal for providing ti@@ mely and relevant information on Europe 's environment .
4.@@ 2 Communications
Commission and the European Parliament , the Presidency @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ office of the Council of Ministers and the public interests in different regions of Europe ;
• expanding our out@@ reach to cover more sectors engaged in environmental policy @@@ -@@ @ making , research and education , and meeting their needs for environmental information when possible ;
• strengthening and wi@@ den@@ ing our media network and using it to multi@@ ply the effect of our messages and increase the visi@@ bility of the Agency as a key provider of environmental information ;
• building an end @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ end communications programme in the Agency , fostering strong internal communications and communications training for E@@ EA staff ;
• ta@@ il@@ oring our out@@ puts for multiple purposes and audiences , and using a variety of channels to deliver them ;
• implementing a more targeted media approach , selec@@ ting the media we wish to work with depending on the messages we want to get across and the target group we aim to reach ;
• creating special web @@@ -@@ @ based education materials ;
• monitoring the effectiveness of our activities to ensure two @@@ -@@ @ way communication and dialogue .

better management of municipal waste will reduce green@@ house gas emissions
• The amount of municipal waste is expected to grow by 25 % from 2005 to 2020 .
• In@@ cre@@ ased recovery of waste , and di@@ ver@@ ting waste away from land@@ fill play a key role in tackling the environmental imp@@ acts of increasing waste vol@@ u@@ mes .
• As recycling and inc@@ iner@@ ation with energy recovery are increasingly used , net green@@ house gas emissions from municipal waste management are expected to drop considerably by 2020 .
• limiting or avoiding growth in waste vol@@ u@@ mes would further reduce green@@ house gas emissions from the waste sector and deliver other benefits to society and the environment .
growing waste vol@@ u@@ mes of Luxembourg 30 cm th@@ ick or Malta 2.5 m th@@ ick !
on average , each European citizen generated 4@@ 60 kg municipal waste in 1995 .
this amount rose to 5@@ 20 kg per person in 2004 , and a further increase to 6@@ 80 kg per person is projected by 2020 .
in total , this correspon@@ ds to an increase of almost 50 % in 25 years .
however , as shown in F@@ ig@@ ure 1 , there are significant differences
histor@@ ically , disposal by land@@ filling has been the pre@@ dominant treatment method for municipal waste , but over the last two decades considerable reductions in land@@ filling have taken place .
in 2004 , 47 % of total EU municipal waste was land@@ filled

this is expected to decrease further to around 35 % by 2020 .
recycling and other material ‑ recovery operations are expected to increase from the current level of 36 % to around 42 % by 2020 .
finally inc@@ iner@@ ation was used for 17 % of municipal waste in 2004 and is likely to increase to about 25 % by 2020 .
this pus@@ hes direct emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es from the waste management sector up .
Land@@ filling represents 60 % of the total in 2020 , and recycling and inc@@ iner@@ ation about 20 % each .
overall , therefore , the projections show that better management of municipal waste will reduce green@@ house gas emissions in Europe , dec@@ ou@@ pling environmental pressures from economic growth as called for in the Si@@ x@@ th Environment Action Programme .
the projections used in this study assume that waste management capacity gro@@ ws to match demand . however , if investment in new and

this represents savings ( or avoided green@@ house gas emissions ) that off@@ set direct emissions .

they address priority issues of climate change , nature and bio@@ diversity , the use of natural resources and health . signals uses several approaches to tell its stories .
while each story has specific points to make , as a collection , they also illu@@ str@@ ate the many inter @@@ -@@ @ relations between seem@@ ingly un@@ connected issues .

remember to write ' S@@ ign@@ als ' in the subject field .
from researchers up to their k@@ ne@@ es in water to satellite im@@ aging from space , we work with a huge amount of environmental data .
finding , reading and understanding the range of " signals " regarding the health and diversity of our environment is at the heart of what we do .
signals , which will be published in all 26 E@@ EA languages , takes
editorial but there are environ@@ ments without societies .
he estimated that the cost of climate change imp@@ acts could be mas@@ sively reduced if emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es were cut immediately .
initiatives like S@@ tern have helped people to understand what is at stake if we continue our current consumption pat@@ ter@@ ns .
above all , we need to regain a sense of hum@@ il@@ ity about the natural world because , as indi@@ gen@@ ous peoples have long understood , we must ultimately answer to nature .
nature has rules and limits of its own .
our natural world is the bed@@ rock - not the back@@ drop - of our soci@@ et@@ y@@ .@@ With S@@ ign@@ als , we intend to contribute to this appreciation of the natural environment .
we hope to influence thinking and attitudes and effect the decisions that all of us make every day .
this will be an historic year for the environment culmin@@ ating in a major UN meeting on climate change in Copenhagen next December .
the meeting , possibly the most important environmental gathering to date , must come up with a successor to the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col .
green@@ house gas emissions are just one symp@@ tom of a much deeper issue : our in@@ ability to live sustain@@ ably .
however , the scale of these environmental problems should not paral@@ yse us into in@@ action .
it should raise our awareness and encourage us to develop new , more sustainable pat@@ ter@@ ns of living , growing , producing and consum@@ ing . ultimately , we are talking about re@@ valu@@ ing the fundamental elements of life .
our natural world often provides a stun@@ ning back@@ drop to our daily lives .
it may be a local stream , pon@@ d or stretch of beach .
on a gr@@ ander scale , we are struck by the beauty of the Al@@ ps or the Car@@ path@@ ian mountains , the ancient forests , the great rivers or the stun@@ ning co@@ asts .
there were 3 billion people on ear@@ th when I was born .
today there are 6.@@ 7 billion of us and we expect the number to rise to 9 billion by 20@@ 50 .
the world 's economy , in terms of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , has grown at an unprecedented rate : in 19@@ 50 GDP was EU@@ R 4 tril@@ lion .
this ten fold increase has several key drivers , not least the movement of raw materials and goods - which come from our environment .
in contrast to this economic growth , our environment has suffered .
Gla@@ ci@@ ers are mel@@ ting in Europe 's mountain ran@@ ges with more river flooding expected as a consequence and mis@@ ery for millions of ordinary people .
ar@@ c@@ tic summer sea ice is rec@@ eding and thin@@ ning faster than ever : in 2007 the extent of the sea ice was half that meas@@ ured in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
around the world , more than a billion , mostly poor , people rely on fisher@@ ies for their food and li@@ v@@ eli@@ ho@@ ods .
however , half of all wild fisher@@ ies have been fully explo@@ ited .
the majority of today 's commercial fisher@@ ies are likely to have collapsed by 20@@ 50 if current trends are not rever@@ sed .

it was here that the global effort to tackle climate change began in ear@@ n@@ est . the summit resulted in the United N@@ ations Framework Convention on C@@ lim@@ ate Change ( UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C ) which forms the legal basis for global efforts to address climate change .
meetings of the Convention , known as Con@@ ferences of the Par@@ ties ( c@@ ops ) , have taken place every year since 1994 .

just as athletes are regularly tested to make sure they stay within the rules , there is regular monitoring .
the latest report released in June 2008 is based on data from 2006 .
it shows that emissions from the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 were 3 % below the ' base year ' .
what do the numbers mean ?
K@@ yo@@ to - a first step in cutting emissions
data from around Europe on emissions of so @@@ -@@ @ called green@@ house gas@@ es are collected , ver@@ ified and then analy@@ sed in two key reports that fe@@ ed into the K@@ yo@@ to process .
this year , the numbers and the analysis they facilitate , have a particular significance in the context of the Co@@ p 15 meeting as they clearly show how the EU is doing with its own efforts to cut emissions of green@@ house gas@@ es .
the invent@@ ory report - counting gas@@ es
the concept of counting gas@@ es is quite ab@@ str@@ act .
as a result it is also difficult to figure out what a percentage cut or increase in emissions means .
it may help to imag@@ ine the cuts as days of the year .
the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 K@@ yo@@ to target transla@@ tes into 29 days worth of emis@@ sion@@ s.@@ For each of the 5 years between 2008 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 , EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 emissions should be on average , 29 days less than 1990 levels .
in this way , emis@@ sion reductions must occur consistently over several ye@@ ar@@ s.@@ The latest E@@ EA data show that 10 days worth of emissions were cut between 1990 and 2006 .
the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 must cut 19 more days to meet the target .
trends and projections
the K@@ yo@@ to Pro@@ to@@ col , signed in 1997 as an extension of the UNF@@ C@@ C@@ C , is a first step in the long @@@ -@@ @ term emissions reduction effort that is needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .
for example , the 15 countries who were members of the EU ( EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 ) in 1997 have a joint target to cut emissions by 8 % compared to the K@@ yo@@ to ' base year ' ( 1 ) .
they must achieve this target during the period 2008 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 ( 2 ) .@@ Countries are expected to meet their K@@ yo@@ to targets mainly by cutting emissions at home .
however a range of other options are available to help them reach their target ( see box : get us to K@@ yo@@ to on time ) . ' K@@ yo@@ to ' has been quite controversial mainly because the United States did not ratify it and because developing
immediately after the hand @@@ -@@ @ over of the ' invent@@ ory ' report , the E@@ EA 's climate change team begins its second major reporting exercise of the year culmin@@ ating in the ' Tren@@ ds and projections ' report .
the report is published in the winter just as the annual UN Co@@ p meeting is about to meet .
the first E@@ EA green@@ house gas report comes out each spring and is called the ' invent@@ ory ' report .
green@@ house gas@@ es in this context refer to a collection of the most serious climate changing gas@@ es including : car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide , me@@ than@@ e , nit@@ ro@@ us ox@@ ide as well as f@@ lu@@ or@@ inated gas@@ es .
consider the energy sector , which is responsible for more than 80 % of the total green@@ house gas@@ es emissions in the EU .
different gas@@ es have different ' base years ' under K@@ yo@@ to . for car@@ bon di@@ ox@@ ide , me@@ than@@ e and nit@@ ro@@ us ox@@ ide ( 99 % of all emissions ) 1990 is used as the ' base year ' for all EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States .
for f@@ lu@@ or@@ inated gas@@ es , countries can choose another year instead .
twelve EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember States have chosen 1995 . the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 has a joint K@@ yo@@ to target .
within this , each EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 M@@ ember State has a differ@@ enti@@ ated reduction target : some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase .
new EU M@@ ember States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta , which have no targets .
this report contains a deeper analysis of the emis@@ sion trends outlined in the first report and pin points where the emissions and emis@@ sion 's reductions came from .
most importantly , the report looks ahead and evalu@@ ates projections of future green@@ house gas emissions as far as 2012 and beyond to 2020 .
a combination of approaches will be needed to fill the remaining gap , the report says .
get us to K@@ yo@@ to on time
emissions from the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 were 3 % below ' base year ' levels in 2006 , according to the latest E@@ EA data .
countries that have signed up to K@@ yo@@ to must make substantial emissions reductions at home .
the EU ' emissions Tr@@ ading scheme ' ( EU E@@ T@@ S ) is another tool , which helps

during the K@@ yo@@ to period ( 2008 @@@ -@@ @ 2012 ) developed countries can also trade emis@@ sion allow@@ ances between themselves in order to meet their national targets .
looking ahead to 2020 , the report gives a long range estimate of the emissions situation in Europe .

the buz@@ z words , ' common but differ@@ enti@@ ated responsibility ' , first ut@@ tered at the Earth Summit in R@@ io , have pop@@ ped up ever since in climate change circles .
in simple language the ph@@ r@@ ase reflects the fact that developed nations have a greater responsibility for the green@@ house gas@@ es in our atmosphere .
these countries have been more industri@@ alised , have created more emissions and should have legal targets to cut emissions before developing nations .
it has proved very difficult to turn the concept into action acceptable to both industri@@ alised and developing countries .
next December , a major task of the Co@@ p 15 will be to finally turn the rhetoric into a global emissions reduction effort .
that means new targets for emissions reductions and most importantly the buy @@@ -@@ @ in of America and major developing nations such as India and China .
we already know the EU 's position on future emissions reduction efforts : a 20 % cut in emissions by 2020 , growing to a 30 % cut if other developed nations sign up at Copenhagen .
all EU @@@ -@@ @ 27 M@@ ember States will be included .

the old apartment does not have a water tank of its own so the Tek@@ ins ' are directly connected to the city 's water system .
a drought in Western Turkey over the past two years means that water is regularly shut off by the city for periods of up to 36 hours .
water shortages are not new - Barış re@@ members them from his ch@@ ild@@ hood .

green@@ house gas@@ es are causing our climate to change .
southern Europe is expected to become war@@ mer and dri@@ er while the North and North West will most likely become mil@@ der and w@@ et@@ ter .
overall global temperatures will continue to rise .
however , even if emissions stop today , climate change will continue for a long time due to the historical build up of green@@ house gas@@ es in the atmosphere .
imp@@ acts are already clear in the Ar@@ c@@ tic , for example .
we must begin to adap@@ t .
adap@@ tation means assessing and dealing with the vulner@@ ability of human and natural systems .
EU M@@ ember States agree that global temper@@ ature increases should be limited to 2 ° C above pre @@@ -@@ @ industrial levels in order to avoid severe changes to our climate .
m@@ iti@@ gation efforts are focused on cutting emissions of ' green@@ house ' gas@@ es .
limiting temper@@ ature increases to 2 ° C
climate change m@@ iti@@ gation and adap@@ tation are very closely linked .
the more successful m@@ iti@@ gation efforts are in cutting emissions , the less extensive our need for adap@@ tation .
as temperatures rise , southern Europe 's reserves of water will drop .
at the same time , agriculture and tourism will require more water especially in the hot@@ ter dri@@ er regi@@ on@@ s.@@ A@@ n increase in water temperatures and lower river flows in the south will also affect water quality .
reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s that were at 20 % of their capacity in March are now 44 % full .
some plants now make use of solar energy , which is a positive step .
however , de@@ sal@@ ination is still expensive .
also , the sal@@ ty br@@ ine , a by product of the process is difficult to dis@@ pose of and can harm the environment .
managing our water resources
'@@ It is often over 40 ° C here in the summer and the hum@@ idity can be very high , ' Barış says from Istanbul .
Mediterranean countries are increasingly re@@ lying on de@@ sal@@ ination to provide fresh water .
Spain currently has 700 de@@ sal@@ ination plants , which provide enough water for 8 million people every day .
de@@ sal@@ ination is expected to double over the next 50 years in Sp@@ ain@@ .@@ Water shortages are not restricted to Sou@@ thern Europe .
the United Kingdom is construc@@ ting its first de@@ sal@@ ination plant in east London .
at a cost of G@@ BP 200m , more than EU@@ R 250m , the facility could supply 140 million lit@@ res of water a day , enough to supply 400 000 homes .
this means taking action to reduce and manage demand instead of simply trying to increase the supply of water .
the Water Framework Direc@@ tive ( W@@ F@@ D ) , the defining piece of legislation on water in Europe , obli@@ ges M@@ ember States to use pri@@ cing ( charging money ) for water @@@ -@@ @ related services as an effective tool for promoting water conserv@@ ation .

more apartments , more tourists and more golf courses mean increased demand for water .
coastal areas in the North and West of Europe , where increased flooding is expected , are also being rapidly developed . the integration of adap@@ tation into key EU policies has been limited .

initial estimates put the cost in Europe at more than EU@@ R 10 billion per year .

inv@@ asive ali@@ en species also change the ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems they live in and impact on the other species in those ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems .
bio@@ diversity - the wider context ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems and existing native plant and animal species . the problem of inv@@ asive species is expected to wor@@ sen in the coming century through climate change , increasing trade and tourism .
bio@@ diversity ref@@ ers to the variety of life on ear@@ th .
it represents the plan@@ et 's natural wealth and as such provides the basis for our lives and prosperity .
it supports many basic services that we depend on such as the water we drink and the air we bre@@ a@@ the .
it helps to pol@@ lin@@ ate crops , put food on the table , regulate weather pat@@ ter@@ ns and clean up our waste .
currently , bio@@ diversity is van@@ ishing at an alarming rate mainly because of how we misuse nature to sustain production , consumption and trade in the global@@ ized economy we live in .
the other main threats to bio@@ diversity come from pollution , climate change and over @@@ -@@ @ exploitation of resources .
as the world 's population is forecast to grow from 6.@@ 7 billion people today to nine billion in 20@@ 50 , it is expected that the imp@@ acts on bio@@ diversity from the current main threats will grow and losses increase .
without bio@@ diversity we would not be able to survive . as such it can be seen as an insurance policy provided to us by the plan@@ et .
inv@@ asive ali@@ en species are considered by many conserv@@ ation@@ ists to be the second greatest threat to bio@@ diversity worldwide .
whether introduced deliberately or ac@@ cid@@ ent@@ ally , such species can cause ha@@ vo@@ c to people ,
I@@ AS and Europe - increasing imp@@ acts contact can result in strong der@@ mati@@ tis .
today , the giant ho@@ g@@ we@@ ed is most likely beyond eradi@@ cation in Europe while early actions ( up to the 19@@ 5@@ 0s ) probably would have had better prospects .
in line with this , the European Commission in the recent communication on bio@@ diversity underlined the need for an ' early warning ' mechanism for inv@@ asive ali@@ en species .
the most @@@ -@@ @ wanted list
ali@@ en species come in all shap@@ es and siz@@ es .
some are deliberately introduced and economically important , others have little impact but quite a few have been a disaster .
as a result , a first step in developing control and management measures , is to identify the most offensive species so that efforts are directed towards these .
the list currently contains 16@@ 3 species or species groups .
many also affect human health and the economy .
since 19@@ 50 , on average more than one of the listed species establis@@ hes itself each year and there is no clear sign that the situation is improving ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) .
ali@@ en species can be found in all European ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems .
control measures
the most efficient defence against inv@@ asive ali@@ en species is prevention - bas@@ ically a border patrol blocking new species .
a second step is early detection and control .
a striking example is the giant ho@@ g@@ we@@ ed , Her@@ ac@@ leum man@@ te@@ gaz@@ zi@@ an@@ um , introduced to Europe as an or@@ nam@@ ental plant in the 19th century .
the plant is now subject to considerable local control efforts as the species has established in gr@@ ass@@ lands , along rail@@ ways , road@@ sides and along river banks .

the story is set on 27 July 2008 when an air quality warning was issued in Brussels people 's health or the environment has still not been reached .

two poll@@ ut@@ ants , fine parti@@ c@@ ulate matter and ground @@@ -@@ @ level ozone , are now generally recognised as the most significant in terms of health imp@@ acts .
long @@@ -@@ @ term and peak exposure can lead to a variety of health effects , ranging from minor ir@@ r@@ itation of the res@@ pir@@ atory system to pre@@ mature death .
Par@@ tic@@ ulate matter , a term used to describe a variety of tiny parti@@ c@@ les from sources such as vehicle exha@@ ust@@ s and domestic st@@ ov@@ es , affects the lun@@ gs .
as much as 61 % of the urban population may have been ex@@ posed to levels of ozone that exceed the EU target .

the fact is that emissions of many air poll@@ ut@@ ants have fallen substan@@ tially across Europe since Anna 's ch@@ ild@@ hood .
the air she and Johan bre@@ a@@ the is much improved compared to the past , and air policy is one of the great success stories of the EU 's environmental efforts .

the efforts required to meet these targets will also cut air pollution in Europe .
for example , improvements in energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy will both lead to reduced amounts of fos@@ sil fuel comb@@ us@@ tion - a key source of air pollution .
these positive side effects are referred to as the ' co @@@ -@@ @ benefits ' of climate change policy .

reform of the Com@@ mon Agri@@ cultural Policy
a sh@@ rin@@ king resource Al@@ most 80 % of Europeans live in big cities , towns or the urban settlements between the two , far removed from the re@@ alities of agriculture .
our rural landscape nevertheless has a huge significance in terms of providing food , raw materials , fuel and rec@@ re@@ ational opportunities .
the C@@ AP in context
the C@@ AP was introduced in 19@@ 62 and consu@@ mes 40 % of the entire EU budget .
in 2007 this translated into over EU@@ R 54 billion .
agriculture contributes to 1.2 % of EU GDP and 4.@@ 7 % of all jobs in the EU ( 1 ) .
the C@@ AP currently has two ' pil@@ lars ' : production and there is a stronger focus on rural development and environmental objectives .
C@@ AP is currently undergoing a ' health check ' by the European Commission , the European Parliament and Mem@@ bers States .
in the context of the discussions on the future of the policy , the E@@ EA is also preparing an analysis of the C@@ AP focusing on ' targeting ' of the subsi@@ dy 's ' environmental ' spending .
where is the money going and what effect is it having ?
what follows is a pre@@ view of some of our findings .
• P@@ il@@ lar I provides direct aid and market interven@@ tions to secure food production and farmers ' income , and making European agriculture more competitive .
it is the dominant part of the budget , responsible for 7@@ 7.5 % of the total C@@ AP expendi@@ ture in 2006 .
• P@@ il@@ lar II recognises the central role of far@@ ming as a supplier of food and goods , as the cor@@ ner@@ stone of rural societies and as a potential environmental manager .
the measures , implemented through R@@ ural Development programmes , are aimed at restructuring the agriculture sector and encouraging environmental protection , diversi@@ fication and innovation in rural areas .
farmers manage half of the EU 's land area and have a huge impact on Europe 's soil , water and bio@@ diversity .
recent analysis shows that agriculture uses half of the water available in southern Europe .
in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 15 , far@@ ming causes almost half of the nit@@ ro@@ gen pollution in rivers , 94 % of am@@ mon@@ ia emissions and 9 % of total green@@ house gas emissions .
many of our rar@@ est species are actually dependent on the continuation of traditional far@@ ming practices .
high nature value ( H@@ N@@ V ) far@@ m@@ land is land that is particularly rich in ha@@ bit@@ ats and species of conserv@@ ation concern .
it is often associated with traditional or low inten@@ s@@ ity agriculture , which is not very econom@@ ical .
most farmers have intensified production or abandoned far@@ ming altogether - trends that threaten natural habi@@ tat@@ s.@@ A@@ n important agriculture policy challenge is to provide economic incentives to farmers for a continuation of w@@ ild@@ life friendly far@@ ming practices .
the Com@@ mon Agriculture Policy ( C@@ AP ) has undergone a series of fundamental reforms since its birth in an era of post @@@ -@@ @ war food shortages .
the subsi@@ dy has increasingly been dec@@ ou@@ pled from its original goal of increasing food
the E@@ EA has analy@@ sed the current expendi@@ ture pat@@ tern to check how the C@@ AP may contribute to maintenance of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land .
current data show the allocation of C@@ AP funding at a national level .
information within countries is much less detailed .
as a result the E@@ EA has supported case studies in the Netherlands , Estonia , France , Spain and the Czech Republic in an attempt to evaluate spending in more detail .
pil@@ lar II is dedicated to the development of rural areas and also funds environmental management sch@@ e@@ mes .
data for EU @@@ -@@ @ 25 , 2006 .
countries with a high share of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land receive comparatively little under P@@ il@@ lar I of the C@@ AP budget ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) .
this is not surprising given that this pil@@ lar was originally production @@@ -@@ @ related and is most common in areas of intensive far@@ ming .
pil@@ lar II ( rural development ) expendi@@ ture per hectar@@ e generally increases with H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land share .
however , spending on AG@@ RI @@@ -@@ @ environment sch@@ e@@ mes - the element most related to conserv@@ ation - is not strongly connected to the amount of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land in the areas studied ( F@@ ig@@ ure 2 ) .
it should also be noted that this intervention accounts for less than 5 % of total C@@ AP payments .

in 19@@ 75 there were 120 000 bre@@ eding p@@ airs in the Netherlands .
today there are about 38 000 .
numbers of bre@@ eding p@@ airs are dropping across Europe .
conclusions from this example could be applied to the entire C@@ AP budget in terms of its environmental improvement efforts : the C@@ AP is having an effect but it 's not effective enough .
however , this ' package ' of measures would be very expensive .
in these areas a combination of measures should be taken such as late and ir@@ regular mo@@ wing , low nut@@ ri@@ ent in@@ puts and maintenance of high water tables .
God@@ w@@ it chic@@ ks must eat about 20 000 in@@ sec@@ ts in the first week of their life if they are to survive .
scientists agree that earlier mo@@ wing practices by farmers are at the root of the go@@ d@@ w@@ it population decline .
the first gr@@ ass cutting in the Netherlands happens three weeks earlier then 40 years ago , probably due to improved fer@@ tilis@@ ation .
in@@ sec@@ t populations are much higher in t@@ all gr@@ ass@@ es and increase even further in gr@@ ass@@ lands that have not been heavily fer@@ til@@ ised .
in short gr@@ ass , par@@ ent birds simply can@@ not find enough in@@ sec@@ ts to fe@@ ed their chic@@ ks in those crucial first days .
pre@@ d@@ ators have also become a larger threat because chic@@ ks are easy pre@@ y in the open short cut gr@@ ass@@ lands .
in 2006 EU@@ R 1.2 billion of the C@@ AP budget was allocated for the Netherlands , some of which was used to encourage later gr@@ ass @@@ -@@ @ cutting .
Studies have shown that the survival rate of go@@ d@@ wit@@ s chic@@ ks doub@@ les on pas@@ tures benef@@ iting from the late cutting .
this in a nut@@ shel@@ l sum@@ s up the challenge facing C@@ AP where targeting of funds and design of policy at a local level is crucial .
in 2006 , EU@@ R 1.2 billion was spent under P@@ il@@ lar I in the Netherlands ; EU@@ R 8@@ 3.2 million was spent under P@@ il@@ lar II .
the single farm payments , under P@@ il@@ lar I , are still very much targeted at far@@ ms with a high productivity because current support payments are linked to the historic distribution of subsidies .

consequences for bio@@ diversity Ul@@ ti@@ mately , the effect of the C@@ AP payments on maintenance of H@@ N@@ V far@@ m@@ land is what counts in this analysis .
the available information does not support a clear answer due to a lack of sp@@ ati@@ al detail .
the E@@ EA case studies confirm that the majority of P@@ il@@ lar I subsidies are targeted to the most productive areas .
bio@@ diversity is low here and the subsi@@ dy provides little incentive to environment @@@ -@@ @ friendly production .
assessing whether the subsidies are adequate to prevent both land aband@@ on@@ ment on the one hand and intensi@@ fication on the other , however , would need further study .
the evidence regarding the implementation of AG@@ RI @@@ -@@ @ environment sch@@ e@@ mes suggests that their effectiveness could be improved .
some of the measures are promising wh@@ il@@ st others show little effect .
in addition , de@@ population of the country@@ side and changing lif@@ est@@ y@@ les may be posing over@@ ar@@ ching threats to traditional far@@ ming systems that in the long run can@@ not be solved through subsidies .
looking ahead
funding for the C@@ AP will be part of a major review of the entire EU budget in 2009 @@@ -@@ @ 2010 .
the limited information available suggests that the current distribution of C@@ AP funds is not very effective from the perspective of achieving EU environmental objectives , in particular on nature protection .
one further result of the E@@ EA analysis is that the available statistical information on C@@ AP spending pat@@ ter@@ ns is still not sufficient to properly evaluate the effects of this important policy .
enhancing P@@ il@@ lar II and targeting measures at high nature value far@@ m@@ land is a valid option , but requires careful design and evaluation to prevent un@@ intended negative imp@@ acts .
fish out of water
Mar@@ ine management in a changing climate
a fisher@@ man 's tal@@ e On the night of 6 October 1986 lob@@ ster fisher@@ men from the small town of G@@ il@@ le@@ le@@ je , north of Copenhagen , fishing the Kat@@ te@@ g@@ at Sea , found their n@@ ets cr@@ am@@ med with Norway lob@@ ster .
many of the animals were dead or dying .
about half were a st@@ range col@@ our .

Hen@@ rik S@@ par@@ hol@@ t , IC@@ ES Advis@@ ory Programme Profes@@ sional Offic@@ er
the region has become an international case study with lessons for other regions .
fishing for data
the st@@ range events were caused by ' ano@@ x@@ ia ' or lack of ox@@ y@@ gen on the sea bed that night .
these decisions often reflect priorities other than the protection of sto@@ cks .
in 2006 , approximately 45 % of the assessed fish sto@@ cks in Europe 's Se@@ as were f@@ ished outside safe biological limits .
these fishing levels were agreed at the ministerial level .
fish bre@@ a@@ the ox@@ y@@ gen dis@@ solved in water
for centuries the ab@@ und@@ ance of fish was the cor@@ ner@@ stone of the local economy .
in the 197@@ 0s about half of the fisher@@ ies income came from co@@ d .
by the end of the 1980s co@@ d fisher@@ ies had increased to 80 % of the total value .
many fisher@@ men imag@@ ined a bright future and invested in new vessels .
however , by 1990 the catch was on a steep decline .
this collapse put huge financial pressure on the local community .
co@@ d in the Bal@@ tic ( 1 000 tonnes co@@ d )
when water near the se@@ ab@@ ed becomes ano@@ xic , hydro@@ gen sul@@ p@@ hide is released from the sea floor into the water .
hydro@@ gen sul@@ p@@ hide is to@@ xic to most life forms , and it was probably a combination of hydro@@ gen sul@@ p@@ hide and lack of ox@@ y@@ gen that killed the Norway lob@@ sters in the Kat@@ te@@ g@@ at that night back in 1986 .
this redu@@ ces the sp@@ aw@@ ning success of co@@ d .
why were the early 1980s such good years for co@@ d fisher@@ ies ?
catch
in almost every year when the co@@ d stock has been assessed , the TA@@ C has been set higher than the recommended level .
the TA@@ C exceeds the recommended level by more than 100 % in some of the most recent years .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , the actual catch is com@@ mon@@ ly higher that the TA@@ C because estimated illegal fisher@@ ies are also included in the figures .
source : E@@ EA , 2008 .
the high survival rate of co@@ d eg@@ gs and lar@@ va@@ e from 197@@ 8 @@@ -@@ @ 198@@ 3 is explained by four factors .
the primary explanation is that fishing pressure was reduced in the late 197@@ 0s .
secondly , clim@@ atic conditions brought inf@@ lows of high sal@@ in@@ ity water from the North Sea .
the Bal@@ tic was actually a fres@@ h@@ water lake until sea levels rose about 8 000 years ago , allowing the North Sea to flow into the lake .
sal@@ in@@ ity in the Bal@@ tic has decreased steadily since the mid 1980s due to increased rain and reduced flows from the North Sea into the Bal@@ tic Sea .
this means that sto@@ cks of co@@ d and other mar@@ ine fish are likely to decline further unless fishing pressure is reduced .
illegal fishing adds to the problem .
it has been estimated that an additional 30 % is lan@@ ded illegally in this part of the Bal@@ tic Sea .
and then climate change !
in response to the complex and severe environmental problems in the Bal@@ tic Sea , the countries in the region have agreed a ' Bal@@ tic Sea Action Plan ' to develop national actions towards integr@@ ating agricultural , fisher@@ ies and regional policies . this plan , adopted in
climate change is affecting both the temper@@ ature and the salt balance of the Bal@@ tic .
both factors are driven by climate .
quite a small reduction in the sal@@ in@@ ity is already ti@@ pping the balance and changing the composition of the Bal@@ tic ha@@ bit@@ at .
of the three major f@@ ished species , co@@ d , her@@ ring , and spr@@ at , co@@ d is particularly sensitive to reduced sal@@ in@@ ity because sal@@ in@@ ity affects both their re@@ productive capacity and the avail@@ ability of the preferred food for co@@ d lar@@ va@@ e .

however , risks within Europe could be les@@ sen@@ ed with the right choice of crops and management .
bi@@ of@@ u@@ els made from waste , from cro@@ p or forest@@ ry resi@@ du@@ es for example , do offer environmental advantages .
in this context , the E@@ EA has been looking at how the im@@ pending bio@@ energy boom might develop , and considering whether it can provide the energy we need without damaging the environment .

the European Commission has proposed a mandatory target : 20 % of all European energy should come from rene@@ w@@ ables ( that 's all renewable sources : wind , solar , wave , et@@ c@@ . as well as bio@@ energy ) by 2020 .
at the moment , rene@@ w@@ ables account for 6.@@ 7 % of European energy consumption .
two thirds of this comes from bi@@ om@@ ass@@ .@@ The European Commission is also keen to promote bi@@ of@@ u@@ els - fuel for transport - as diversi@@ fication is particularly important in transport because of its dependence on oil .
the transport sector is also increasing green@@ house gas emissions and e@@ ating up emissions savings achieved by other sectors . the Commission has therefore proposed that bi@@ of@@ u@@ els make up 10 % of road transport fuel by 2020 , providing they can be certi@@ fied as sustainable .

however , in the context of this analysis it ref@@ ers specifically to fuels for transport .
this is important because de@@ forest@@ ation and far@@ ming practices are currently responsible for an estimated 20 % of global green@@ house gas emissions .
the EU bi@@ of@@ uel target is surrounded by more and more debate .
the European Parliament has recently called for a guarantee that 40 % of the 10 % target will come from sources that do not compete with food production .
the E@@ EA 's own Scientific Committee has warned that increasing the share of bi@@ of@@ u@@ els used in transport to 10 % by 2020 is over@@ ambitious and should be suspended .

and let 's do it in a way that considers all the environmental imp@@ acts , including effects on soil , water and bio@@ diversity as well as green@@ house gas emissions .
in this way the EU can take the lead in building a truly sustainable bio@@ energy sector .

a lot more research is needed on these production processes and their imp@@ acts and opportunities .
moreover , competition for land and water between dedicated energy crops and food crops will likely remain .
this process har@@ nesses the heat that is a by @@@ -@@ @ product of energy production .
there are costs , of course .
enhancing bio@@ energy use is around 20 % more expensive than a similar model of conventional energy by 20@@ 30 .

international ship@@ ments of waste and the environment

the truth is that waste placed in a bin in London , can quite easily end up 5 000 mil@@ es away in a recycling factory in China 's P@@ ear@@ l River del@@ ta .

EU policy , setting targets for recycling , also leads to waste ship@@ ments from M@@ ember States who can@@ not meet their targets at home .
the vol@@ u@@ mes of waste on the market keep costs low for a country like China , which needs cheap raw materials .
as long as this waste is not for disposal at its destination and does not contain haz@@ ard@@ ous materials , it is deemed to be an acceptable trade .

tr@@ acking down good data on electric and electronic waste
Europe has a body of legislation in place regarding the ship@@ ment of haz@@ ard@@ ous and problematic waste .
however , further evidence is required as to the effectiveness of the legislation in terms of easing pressure on the environment@@ .@@ Electronic waste , which is considered haz@@ ard@@ ous , is an important case .
in Africa and Asia it is often disman@@ tled with little or no personal protection equipment or pollution control measures .
waste of all descri@@ p@@ tions is on the move .
increasing amounts , especially of waste paper , plas@@ tics and met@@ als are being shi@@ pped from developed countries to countries where environmental standards are less str@@ ingent .
huge ships ste@@ am around the high seas everyday carrying goods from emerging markets in Asia to the West .
that does not mean that ship@@ ments of waste are not regulated . both the UN and the EU have strict rules on what can be shi@@ pped where .
the ban contained in this Convention has not been signed by enough countries to bring it into force g@@ lob@@ ally .
however , the EU does have restrictions in place and only allows ' haz@@ ard@@ ous waste ' be exported to ' developed countries ' where the necessary technologies exist and sufficient safety and environmental laws are in place .
a ' developed country ' , for the purpose of the restrictions , is defined as a member of the Organisation of Economic Co@@ operation and Development ( OECD ) .@@ The EU 's long term aim is that each M@@ ember State should dis@@ pose of its own waste dome@@ sti@@ cally ( the ' pro@@ xim@@ ity principle ' ) .
however , as ship@@ ments of haz@@ ard@@ ous and problematic waste for
36 / E@@ EA signals 2009 / waste ship@@ ments
driving forces behind recycling regions is expected to be significantly higher .
this suggests that the EU ban on the trade of haz@@ ard@@ ous waste with non @@@ -@@ @ OECD countries is being broken .
using European trade statistics it is possible to identify the amounts , size and value of exports of used electronic and electrical products shi@@ pped from the EU to other regions ( F@@ ig@@ ure 1 ) .
in 2005 , more than 15 000 tonnes of col@@ our television sets were exported from the EU to African countries .
in Ni@@ ger@@ ia , Ghana and Egypt alone about 1 000 TV sets arrived every day .
the average value of exported col@@ our television sets to Africa is very low : for Africa as a whole the price per unit was EU@@ R 64 and EU@@ R 28 on average for the three countries mentioned above .
in comparison , TV sets tra@@ ded within Europe have an average value of EU@@ R 350 .
the amount of waste paper exported to Asia increased by a factor of ten .
for plas@@ tics the increase has been a factor of eleven and for met@@ als a factor of five .
the shi@@ pped waste has also increased within the EU , but at much lower level .
in 2007 as much waste paper was shi@@ pped to Asia as was shi@@ pped from one EU country to another .
the quanti@@ ty of met@@ als shi@@ pped within the EU was larger than the amount shi@@ pped to Asia .
for over a decade , the cost of raw materials has been very high and this , in turn , has increased the value of secondary raw materials rec@@ la@@ imed through recycling .
for example , the amount of paper and c@@ ard@@ board ' pack@@ aging waste ' that is recy@@ c@@ led increased from about 24 to 30 million tonnes between 1997 and 2005 .
the amount of plastic pack@@ aging recy@@ c@@ led has increased from about 10 to 14 million tonnes in the same period .
is it good for the environment ? the use of recy@@ c@@ led waste materials instead of vir@@ gin materials is generally good for the environment .
for example , a kilo of paper made from recy@@ c@@ led raw materials uses half the energy of production using vir@@ gin materials .
al@@ umin@@ ium produced from recy@@ c@@ led al@@ umin@@ ium can use as little 5 % of the energy needed using vir@@ gin materials .
in general , recycling therefore contributes substan@@ tially to the reduction of energy @@@ -@@ @ related emissions of cost and

within the EU it is possible to ship all kinds of was@@ tes for disposal or recovery between M@@ ember States .

the simple act of making environmental information , gathered for research purposes , available to the passengers is a simple but important step - one that must be rep@@ lic@@ ated on a much gr@@ ander scale if we are to make full use of the data and engage and em@@ power the public environment@@ ally .
robust , far @@@ -@@ @ si@@ gh@@ ted policy also requires better , more detailed information .
two new EU initiatives , in which the E@@ EA is playing a leading role and which will be further developed throughout 2009 , are at the heart of this drive .
they are the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( G@@ M@@ ES ) and the Shar@@ ed Environmental Information System ( SE@@ IS ) .@@ G@@ M@@ ES will use satel@@ li@@ tes and sen@@ sors on the ground , flo@@ ating in the water or flying through the air to monitor our natural environment .
it is , however , difficult to tell whether the fisher@@ ies will become ri@@ cher or not .
shipping and tourism are likely to increase , although dri@@ ft ice , short sa@@ iling se@@ as@@ ons and lack of infrastructure will impe@@ de a rapid development of trans@@ contin@@ ental shipping .
