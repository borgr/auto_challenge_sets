a strong password uses a combination of upper and lowercase letters , special characters , and numbers . it doesn 't contain personal info like your address , birthday , or family names .
a strong PIN does not contain personal info , such as your date of birth or address . it should be a number only you know and can 't be easily guessed .

no more making up new passwords
no more " try again " while you 're trying to get somewhere . log in to your Firefox Account on your phone , and your passwords come with you . your LOGIN details will simply appear , just like that .
no one likes a computer hog ! Firefox is a lean , mean ( actually we 're pretty nice ) browsing machine . since we use less ram than Chrome , your other programs can keep running at top speed .
no strings attached
no thanks , I 'll just wait for the email
not interested in our newsletters , but like those special announcements ? no problem .
not only do trackers collect info , they can weigh down your browsing speeds . only Firefox Private browsing blocks ads with hidden trackers , so you can drop the baggage and browse freely .
not ready to dive in just yet ?
no problem . not sure how you want to help ? we can find the appropriate contribution activity for you .
November
now 2x faster
no , we do not buy people 's data to target advertising .
now Firefox creates and stores strong passwords for more of your online accounts - and stops more trackers than ever before .
now Firefox Monitor not only informs you if you 've been involved in known online data breaches , it also lets you take action to resolve them and get closure .
now get on the go .
now you can see how we 're protecting your privacy .

Thunderbird makes email better for you , bringing together speed , privacy and the latest technologies . focus on what matters and forget about complexity .
Thunderbird offers support for user privacy and remote image protection . to ensure a user 's privacy , Thunderbird automatically blocks remote images in email messages .
