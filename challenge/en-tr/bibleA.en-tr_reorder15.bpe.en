God said , " be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed , which is on the sur@@ face of all the ear@@ th , and every tree , which be@@ ars fruit yi@@ el@@ ding se@@ ed . it will be your food .
this is the history of the generations of the heav@@ ens and of the ear@@ th when they were created , in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h God made the ear@@ th and the heav@@ ens .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and ev@@ il , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will su@@ rely die . "
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the gar@@ den , God has said , ' You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die . ' "
they heard the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h God walk@@ ing in the gar@@ den in the co@@ ol of the day , and the man and his wife hi@@ d themselves from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the gar@@ den .
by the swe@@ at of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are d@@ ust , and to d@@ ust you shall return . "
so he dro@@ ve out the man ; and he placed Cher@@ ub@@ s at the east of the gar@@ den of E@@ den , and the fla@@ me of a s@@ word which turned every way , to guard the way to the tree of life .
from now on , when you ti@@ ll the ground , it won '@@ t yield its strength to you . you shall be a fugitive and a w@@ ander@@ er in the ear@@ th . "
I , even I , do bring the flood of waters on this ear@@ th , to destroy all f@@ les@@ h having the bre@@ ath of life from under the sky . everything that is in the ear@@ th will die .
but I will establish my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with you . you shall come into the ship , you , your sons , your wife , and your sons ' wi@@ ves with you .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the ear@@ th for for@@ ty days and for@@ ty n@@ ights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the sur@@ face of the ground . "
S@@ hem and Jap@@ het@@ h took a gar@@ ment , and laid it on both their sho@@ ul@@ ders , went in back@@ wards , and covered the nak@@ edn@@ ess of their father . their faces were back@@ wards , and they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see their father 's nak@@ edn@@ ess .
Can@@ a@@ an became the father of S@@ id@@ on ( his fir@@ st@@ born ) , H@@ eth ,
Yah@@ we@@ h said , " be@@ hold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be with@@ held from them , which they intend to do .
Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took wi@@ ves . the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai , and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an who was also the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
there was a fam@@ ine in the land . Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to live as a foreig@@ ner there , for the fam@@ ine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sar@@ ai his wife , " Se@@ e now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
there was a stri@@ fe between the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck and the her@@ d@@ s@@ men of lot 's li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite lived in the land at that time .
that they made war with Ber@@ a , king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ s@@ ha , king of G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , Sh@@ ina@@ b , king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and She@@ me@@ ber , king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a ( the same is Zo@@ ar ) .
he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and struck them , and pursu@@ ed them to H@@ ob@@ ah , which is on the left hand of Dam@@ as@@ cus .
be@@ hold , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying , " This man will not be your he@@ ir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your he@@ ir . "
Sar@@ ai , Ab@@ ram 's wife , took Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , her hand@@ ma@@ id , after Ab@@ ram had lived ten years in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and gave her to Ab@@ ram her husband to be his wife .
the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised male who is not circum@@ c@@ ised in the f@@ les@@ h of his fo@@ res@@ kin , that sou@@ l shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant . "
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of So@@ dom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
but he lin@@ gered ; and the men gra@@ bbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ' hands , Yah@@ we@@ h being mer@@ ci@@ ful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
he looked toward So@@ dom and G@@ om@@ or@@ ra@@ h , and toward all the land of the pla@@ in , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a fur@@ n@@ ace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the pla@@ in , that God remember@@ ed Ab@@ ra@@ ham , and sent lot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in which lot lived .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Ab@@ ra@@ ham built the alt@@ ar there , and laid the wood in order , bound I@@ sa@@ ac his son , and laid him on the alt@@ ar , on the wood .
that I will b@@ less you greatly , and I will multi@@ ply your se@@ ed greatly like the stars of the heav@@ ens , and like the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your se@@ ed will poss@@ ess the gate of his enem@@ ies .
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bur@@ y my dead out of my sight , hear me , and ent@@ re@@ at for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
now E@@ ph@@ ron was sitting in the middle of the children of H@@ eth . E@@ ph@@ ron the H@@ itti@@ te answ@@ ered Ab@@ ra@@ ham in the hearing of the children of H@@ eth , even of all who went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Ab@@ ra@@ ham list@@ ened to E@@ ph@@ ron . Ab@@ ra@@ ham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , four hundred sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , according to the current mer@@ chan@@ ts ' standard .
after this , Ab@@ ra@@ ham buried Sar@@ ah his wife in the cave of the field of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah before Mam@@ re ( that is , He@@ br@@ on ) , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
I will make you swe@@ ar by Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of heav@@ en and the God of the ear@@ th , that you shall not take a wife for my son of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , among whom I live .
the ser@@ vant took ten ca@@ me@@ ls , of his master 's ca@@ me@@ ls , and depar@@ ted , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he ar@@ ose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , Re@@ bek@@ ah came out , who was born to B@@ eth@@ uel the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's brother , with her pit@@ cher on her sho@@ ul@@ der .
the young la@@ dy was very beautiful to look at , a vir@@ gin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her pit@@ cher , and came up .
he said to me , ' Yah@@ we@@ h , before whom I walk , will send his an@@ gel with you , and prosp@@ er your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
the ser@@ vant brought out je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing , and gave them to Re@@ bek@@ ah . he also gave pre@@ ci@@ ous things to her brother and her mother .
but to the sons of Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , Ab@@ ra@@ ham gave gifts . he sent them away from I@@ sa@@ ac his son , while he yet lived , eas@@ tw@@ ard , to the east country .
I@@ sa@@ ac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , his sons , buried him in the cave of Mac@@ h@@ pe@@ lah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , the son of Zo@@ har the H@@ itti@@ te , which is before Mam@@ re ,
now this is the history of the generations of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , whom Hag@@ ar the Egyptian , Sar@@ ah 's hand@@ ma@@ id , b@@ ore to Ab@@ ra@@ ham .
these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , then K@@ ed@@ ar , Ad@@ be@@ el , Mi@@ b@@ sam ,
these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el : one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
I@@ sa@@ ac was for@@ ty years old when he took Re@@ bek@@ ah , the daughter of B@@ eth@@ uel the Syrian of Pad@@ dan Ara@@ m , the sister of Lab@@ an the Syrian , to be his wife .
now all the wel@@ ls which his father 's servants had du@@ g in the days of Ab@@ ra@@ ham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped , and filled with ear@@ th .
make me sav@@ ory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my sou@@ l may b@@ less you before I die . "
it happened , as soon as I@@ sa@@ ac had made an end of b@@ les@@ sing Jac@@ o@@ b , and Jac@@ o@@ b had just gone out from the presence of I@@ sa@@ ac his father , that E@@ sa@@ u his brother came in from his hun@@ ting .
by your s@@ word will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k . "
E@@ sa@@ u went to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took , besides the wi@@ ves that he had , Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ab@@ ra@@ ham 's son , the sister of N@@ eb@@ ai@@ o@@ th , to be his wife .
Jac@@ o@@ b rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pil@@ lar , and p@@ oured oil on its top .
Jac@@ o@@ b vowed a vo@@ w , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clo@@ thing to put on ,
he set the ro@@ ds which he had pe@@ eled opposite the f@@ loc@@ ks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ t@@ rough@@ s where the f@@ loc@@ ks came to drink . they conce@@ ived when they came to drink .
Jac@@ o@@ b separated the lam@@ bs , and set the faces of the f@@ loc@@ ks toward the stre@@ aked and all the black in the flock of Lab@@ an : and he put his own dro@@ ves apart , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t put them into Lab@@ an 's flock .
it happened during m@@ ating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and be@@ hold , the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap@@ ed on the flock were stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and be@@ hold , all the male go@@ ats which le@@ ap on the flock are stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ z@@ z@@ led , for I have seen all that Lab@@ an does to you .
Lab@@ an went into Jac@@ o@@ b 's tent , into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them . he went out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into R@@ ach@@ el 's tent .
now come , let us make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant , you and I ; and let it be for a witness between me and you . "
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every her@@ d by itself , and said to his servants , " Pas@@ s over before me , and put a space between her@@ d and her@@ d . "
therefore the children of Israel don '@@ t eat the sin@@ ew of the hip , which is on the hol@@ low of the th@@ igh , to this day , because he touched the hol@@ low of Jac@@ o@@ b 's th@@ igh in the sin@@ ew of the hip .
Jac@@ o@@ b lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , E@@ sa@@ u was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Le@@ ah , R@@ ach@@ el , and the two hand@@ ma@@ ids .
he bought the par@@ cel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
they killed Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , with the edge of the s@@ word , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went away .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an alt@@ ar to God , who answ@@ ered me in the day of my dist@@ ress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
so Jac@@ o@@ b came to L@@ uz ( that is , Be@@ the@@ l ) , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , he and all the people who were with him .
Jac@@ o@@ b set up a pil@@ lar in the place where he spoke with him , a pil@@ lar of stone . he p@@ oured out a drink offering on it , and p@@ oured oil on it .
these are the names of E@@ sa@@ u 's sons : Eli@@ p@@ haz , the son of A@@ da@@ h , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u ; and Re@@ uel , the son of Bas@@ em@@ ath , the wife of E@@ sa@@ u .
chief Dis@@ h@@ on , chief E@@ zer , and chief Dis@@ han : these are the chiefs who came of the H@@ ori@@ tes , according to their chiefs in the land of Se@@ ir .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from E@@ sa@@ u , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Tim@@ na , chief Al@@ v@@ ah , chief J@@ eth@@ eth ,
for be@@ hold , we were binding s@@ heav@@ es in the field , and be@@ hold , my she@@ af ar@@ ose and also stood u@@ pri@@ ght ; and be@@ hold , your s@@ heav@@ es came around , and bo@@ wed down to my she@@ af . "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the p@@ its , and we will say , ' A@@ n ev@@ il animal has dev@@ oured him . ' we will see what will become of his dre@@ ams . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stri@@ pped Joseph of his co@@ at , the co@@ at of many col@@ ors that was on him ;
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Po@@ tip@@ har , an officer of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ eli@@ tes that had brought him down there .
it happened , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cri@@ ed , that he left his gar@@ ment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your ser@@ vant did to me , " that his wr@@ ath was kin@@ d@@ led .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
the keep@@ er of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison . whatever they did there , he was responsible for it .
they both dre@@ amed a dream , each man his dream , in one night , each man according to the interpre@@ tation of his dream , the c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the Bak@@ er of the king of Egypt , who were bound in the prison .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up was in my hand ; and I took the grap@@ es , and pressed them into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up , and I gave the c@@ up into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's hand . "
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head , and restore you to your office . you will give P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's c@@ up into his hand , the way you did when you were his c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er .
within three more days , P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will lift up your head from off you , and will han@@ g you on a tree ; and the birds will eat your f@@ les@@ h from off you . "
it happened the third day , which was P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's birthday , that he made a feast for all his servants , and he lifted up the head of the chief c@@ up@@ be@@ ar@@ er and the head of the chief Bak@@ er among his servants .
be@@ hold , seven other c@@ attle came up after them out of the river , ug@@ ly and th@@ in , and stood by the other c@@ attle on the br@@ ink of the river .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ ic@@ ians and wise men . P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h told them his dre@@ ams , but there was no one who could interpre@@ t them to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h .
there was with us there a young man , a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , ser@@ vant to the captain of the guard , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dre@@ ams . to each man according to his dream he interpreted .
let P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h do this , and let him appoint over@@ se@@ ers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt 's produce in the seven plen@@ te@@ ous years .
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up gra@@ in under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of fam@@ ine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not per@@ ish through the fam@@ ine . "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h took off his sig@@ net ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ray@@ ed him in rob@@ es of fine lin@@ en , and put a gold chain about his nec@@ k ,
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt . Joseph went out from the presence of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with gra@@ in , and to restore each man 's money into his s@@ ack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
it happened as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that be@@ hold , each man 's bun@@ dle of money was in his s@@ ack . when they and their father saw their bun@@ d@@ les of money , they were afraid .
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans don '@@ t eat bread with the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws , for that is an ab@@ omin@@ ation to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
be@@ hold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' m@@ ou@@ ths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we ste@@ al silver or gold out of your lor@@ d 's house ?
we said , ' We can '@@ t go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
then Joseph co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cri@@ ed , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
hur@@ ry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lor@@ d of all Egypt . come down to me . D@@ on '@@ t wait .
the report of it was heard in P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house , saying , " Joseph 's brothers have come . " it pleased P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h well , and his servants .
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the f@@ at of the land . '
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two so@@ ul@@ s . all the so@@ ul@@ s of the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , who came into Egypt , were sev@@ enty .
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ra@@ mes@@ es , as P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h had comman@@ ded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the fam@@ ine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Can@@ a@@ an fa@@ in@@ ted by reason of the fam@@ ine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the gra@@ in which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house .
as for the people , he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it .
now your two sons , who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt , are mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even as Re@@ ub@@ en and Simeon , will be mine .
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yo@@ urs . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inher@@ it@@ ance .
Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stret@@ ched out his right hand , and laid it on E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , gui@@ ding his hands know@@ ingly , for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
my sou@@ l , don '@@ t come into their council . my gl@@ ory , don '@@ t be united to their assembly ; for in their an@@ ger they killed men . in their self @@@ -@@ @ will they ham@@ str@@ ung c@@ attle .
the scep@@ ter will not de@@ part from Ju@@ da@@ h , nor the ru@@ ler 's staff from between his feet , until he comes to whom it belongs . to him will the obe@@ di@@ ence of the peoples be .
but his bo@@ w remained strong . the arms of his hands were made strong , by the hands of the m@@ igh@@ ty One of Jac@@ o@@ b , ( from there is the she@@ ph@@ er@@ d , the stone of Israel ) ,
the king of Egypt spoke to the H@@ eb@@ re@@ w M@@ id@@ wi@@ ves , of whom the name of the one was Shi@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , and the name of the other Pu@@ ah ,
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ y@@ ru@@ s bas@@ ket for him , and co@@ ated it with tar and with pit@@ ch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hi@@ d him in the s@@ and .
now when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h heard this thing , he sought to kill Mos@@ es . but Mos@@ es fled from the face of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and lived in the land of Mi@@ dian , and he sat down by a well .
it happened in the course of those many days , that the king of Egypt died , and the children of Israel si@@ gh@@ ed because of the bon@@ da@@ ge , and they cri@@ ed , and their cry came up to God because of the bon@@ da@@ ge .
moreover he said , " I am the God of your father , the God of Ab@@ ra@@ ham , the God of I@@ sa@@ ac , and the God of Jac@@ o@@ b . " Mos@@ es hi@@ d his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
now , be@@ hold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the op@@ pression with which the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans op@@ press them .
he said , " P@@ ut your hand inside your clo@@ ak again . " he put his hand inside his clo@@ ak again , and when he took it out of his clo@@ ak , be@@ hold , it had turned again as his other f@@ les@@ h .
the t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spoke to the people , saying , " This is what P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h says : ' I will not give you stra@@ w .
the officers of the children of Israel , whom P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's t@@ ask@@ mas@@ ters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Wh@@ y ha@@ ven '@@ t you fulfilled your qu@@ ota both yes@@ ter@@ day and today , in making bri@@ ck as before ? "
I have also established my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their travels , in which they lived as ali@@ ens .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the bur@@ den@@ s of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Mos@@ es and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these are the names of the sons of L@@ evi according to their generations : Ger@@ sh@@ on , and Ko@@ hat@@ h , and Mer@@ ari ; and the years of the life of L@@ evi were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
the sons of Ko@@ hat@@ h : Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el ; and the years of the life of Ko@@ hat@@ h were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ ch@@ eb@@ ed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she b@@ ore him Aaron and Mos@@ es : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
Ele@@ azar Aaron 's son took one of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Pu@@ ti@@ el as his wife ; and she b@@ ore him Ph@@ ine@@ has . these are the heads of the fa@@ thers ' houses of the L@@ evi@@ tes according to their families .
these are those who spoke to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Mos@@ es and Aaron .
you shall speak all that I command you ; and Aaron your brother shall speak to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
but P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judg@@ ments .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became f@@ oul , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Mos@@ es , " T@@ ell Aaron , ' St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand with your ro@@ d over the rivers , over the stre@@ ams , and over the po@@ ols , and cause fro@@ gs to come up on the land of Egypt . ' "
be@@ hold , the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h is on your li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck which are in the field , on the hor@@ ses , on the don@@ ke@@ ys , on the ca@@ me@@ ls , on the her@@ ds , and on the f@@ loc@@ ks with a very gri@@ ev@@ ous p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce .
Yah@@ we@@ h will make a distinc@@ tion between the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Israel and the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of Egypt ; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel . " ' "
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h sent , and , be@@ hold , there was not so much as one of the li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck of the Isra@@ eli@@ tes dead . but the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h was st@@ ub@@ born , and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t let the people go .
the ha@@ il struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the ha@@ il struck every her@@ b of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
the loc@@ ust@@ s went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very gri@@ ev@@ ous . before them there were no such loc@@ ust@@ s as they , neither after them shall be such .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h who s@@ its on his th@@ r@@ one , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female ser@@ vant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two do@@ or@@ posts and on the lin@@ tel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
this is how you shall eat it : with your bel@@ t on your wa@@ ist , your sho@@ es on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in has@@ te : it is Yah@@ we@@ h 's P@@ ass@@ over .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ le@@ av@@ ened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordin@@ ance fore@@ ver .
it shall happen when you have come to the land which Yah@@ we@@ h will give you , according as he has promised , that you shall keep this service .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the children of Israel did according to the word of Mos@@ es ; and they asked of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans je@@ wel@@ s of silver , and je@@ wel@@ s of gold , and clo@@ thing .
they bak@@ ed un@@ le@@ av@@ ened cak@@ es of the d@@ ough which they brought out of Egypt ; for it was@@ n '@@ t le@@ av@@ ened , because they were th@@ rust out of Egypt , and co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t wait , neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
it happened at the end of four hundred thirty years , even the same day it happened , that all the armies of Yah@@ we@@ h went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed to Yah@@ we@@ h for bringing them out from the land of Egypt . this is that night of Yah@@ we@@ h , to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations .
that you shall set apart to Yah@@ we@@ h all that opens the w@@ om@@ b , and every fir@@ st@@ born which you have that comes from an animal . the mal@@ es shall be Yah@@ we@@ h 's .
but God led the people around by the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt .
Yah@@ we@@ h har@@ dened the heart of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and he pursu@@ ed after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
when P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h drew near , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and be@@ hold , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans were mar@@ ching after them ; and they were very afraid . the children of Israel cri@@ ed out to Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel went into the mid@@ st of the sea on the d@@ ry ground , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
Mos@@ es stret@@ ched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans fled against it . Yah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the mid@@ st of the sea .
but the children of Israel walked on d@@ ry land in the mid@@ st of the sea , and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand , and on their left .
then Mos@@ es and the children of Israel san@@ g this song to Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " I will sing to Yah@@ we@@ h , for he has tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed gl@@ ori@@ ously . the hor@@ se and his Ri@@ der he has thrown into the sea .
" you , in your lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness , have led the people that you have re@@ deemed . you have gui@@ ded them in your strength to your hol@@ y habi@@ tation .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h appeared in the cl@@ oud .
when the dew that lay had gone , be@@ hold , on the sur@@ face of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness was a small round thing , small as the F@@ ro@@ st on the ground .
when they meas@@ ured it with an O@@ mer , he who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little had no lack . they gathered every man according to his e@@ ating .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen to Mos@@ es , but some of them left of it until the morning , and it b@@ red wor@@ ms , and became f@@ oul : and Mos@@ es was angry with them .
the children of Israel ate the man@@ na for@@ ty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the man@@ na until they came to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel trav@@ eled from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of sin , by their jour@@ neys , according to Yah@@ we@@ h 's comman@@ d@@ ment , and en@@ camp@@ ed in Rep@@ hi@@ dim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
Mos@@ es went out to meet his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and bo@@ wed and k@@ is@@ sed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Mos@@ es told his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law all that Yah@@ we@@ h had done to P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h and to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for Israel 's sake , all the hard@@ ships that had come on them on the way , and how Yah@@ we@@ h delivered them .
J@@ eth@@ ro , Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , took a bur@@ n@@ t offering and sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for God . Aaron came with all of the el@@ ders of Israel , to eat bread with Mos@@ es ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law before God .
you shall te@@ ach them the stat@@ utes and the laws , and shall show them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
if you will do this thing , and God comman@@ ds you so , then you will be able to en@@ dur@@ e , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i .
when they had depar@@ ted from Rep@@ hi@@ dim , and had come to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of S@@ ina@@ i , they en@@ camp@@ ed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; and there Israel en@@ camp@@ ed before the mountain .
Mos@@ es went up to God , and Yah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jac@@ o@@ b , and tell the children of Israel :
" you shall not make for yo@@ ur@@ selves an i@@ dol , nor any image of anything that is in the heav@@ ens above , or that is in the ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath , or that is in the water under the ear@@ th :
all the people perceived the th@@ under@@ ings , the ligh@@ t@@ nings , the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they tre@@ m@@ b@@ led , and stayed at a distance .
if he rises again and walk@@ s around with his staff , then he who struck him shall be cleared : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall provide for his he@@ aling until he is thor@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly he@@ aled .
or if it is known that the bul@@ l was in the ha@@ bit of gor@@ ing in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall su@@ rely pay bul@@ l for bul@@ l , and the dead animal shall be his own .
if the th@@ i@@ ef is@@ n '@@ t found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he has@@ n '@@ t put his hand to his neigh@@ bor 's goods .
for that is his only covering , it is his gar@@ ment for his s@@ kin . what would he sle@@ ep in ? it will happen , when he cri@@ es to me , that I will hear , for I am gr@@ ac@@ ious .
" you shall not delay to offer from your har@@ v@@ est and from the out@@ flow of your pres@@ ses . " you shall give the fir@@ st@@ born of your sons to me .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don '@@ t inv@@ oke the name of other go@@ ds , neither let them be heard out of your m@@ outh .
I will send my terror before you , and will conf@@ use all the people to whom you come , and I will make all your enem@@ ies turn their backs to you .
Mos@@ es came and told the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all the ord@@ inan@@ ces ; and all the people answ@@ ered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken will we do . "
according to all that I show you , the pat@@ tern of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the pat@@ tern of all of its furniture , even so you shall make it .

Aaron said to them , " T@@ ake off the golden r@@ ings , which are in the e@@ ars of your wi@@ ves , of your sons , and of your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bring them to me . "
Mos@@ es turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tab@@ lets of the testimony in his hand ; tab@@ lets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . be@@ hold , my an@@ gel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
it happened that when Mos@@ es went out to the tent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Mos@@ es , until he had gone into the tent .
all the people saw the pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud stand at the door of the tent , and all the people rose up and wor@@ shi@@ ped , everyone at their tent door .
it will happen , while my gl@@ ory passes by , that I will put you in a cle@@ ft of the rock , and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ;
he ch@@ is@@ eled two tab@@ lets of stone like the first ; and Mos@@ es rose up early in the morning , and went up to Mount S@@ ina@@ i , as Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded him , and took in his hand two stone tab@@ lets .
be careful , lest you make a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the mid@@ st of you :
and you take of their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters to your sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters play the pro@@ stitute after their go@@ ds , and make your sons play the pro@@ stitute after their go@@ ds .
for I will drive out nations before you and en@@ large your borders ; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , three times in the year .
" you shall bring the first of the first fru@@ its of your ground to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God . " you shall not bo@@ il a young go@@ at in its mother 's milk . "
when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es , be@@ hold , the s@@ kin of his face sh@@ one ; and they were afraid to come near him .
but when Mos@@ es went in before Yah@@ we@@ h to speak with him , he took the ve@@ il off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was comman@@ ded .
the children of Israel saw Mos@@ es ' face , that the s@@ kin of Mos@@ es ' face sh@@ one : and Mos@@ es put the ve@@ il on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .

the children of Israel brought a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Yah@@ we@@ h ; every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work , which Yah@@ we@@ h had comman@@ ded to be made by Mos@@ es .
Mos@@ es called B@@ ez@@ al@@ el and O@@ hol@@ i@@ a@@ b , and every wise @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ ted man , in whose heart Yah@@ we@@ h had put wis@@ dom , even everyone whose heart s@@ tir@@ red him up to come to the work to do it :

he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops in the one cur@@ tain , and he made fif@@ ty lo@@ ops in the edge of the cur@@ tain that was in the second cou@@ pling . the lo@@ ops were opposite one to another .

there were six branches going out of its sides : three branches of the lam@@ p@@ stand out of its one side , and three branches of the lam@@ p@@ stand out of its other side :

it happened in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tab@@ ern@@ acle was raised up .
he raised up the court around the tab@@ ern@@ acle and the alt@@ ar , and set up the screen of the gate of the court . so Mos@@ es finished the work .

if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the ev@@ il from Israel .
but if the man find the la@@ dy who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the la@@ dy you shall do nothing ; there is in the la@@ dy no sin wor@@ thy of death : for as when a man rises against his neigh@@ bor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the la@@ dy 's father fif@@ ty sh@@ ek@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has hum@@ b@@ led her ; he may not put her away all his days .
because they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t meet you with bread and with water in the way , when you came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against you Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or from P@@ eth@@ or of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to cur@@ se you .
if there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night , then shall he go outside of the camp . he shall not come within the camp :
and you shall have a p@@ add@@ le among your weapons ; and it shall be , when you sit down abroad , you shall di@@ g there@@ with , and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you :
you shall not bring the h@@ ire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a do@@ g , into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ omin@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h your God .
when you come into your neigh@@ bor 's v@@ ine@@ yard , then you may eat of grap@@ es your fill at your own pleas@@ ure ; but you shall not put any in your ves@@ sel .

you have declared Yah@@ we@@ h this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his stat@@ utes , and his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , and listen to his voice :

your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky , and to the animals of the ear@@ th ; and there shall be none to fri@@ gh@@ ten them away .
Yah@@ we@@ h will strike you with the bo@@ il of Egypt , and with the t@@ um@@ ors , and with the s@@ cur@@ v@@ y , and with the it@@ ch , of which you can not be he@@ aled .

the foreig@@ ner who is in the mid@@ st of you shall mount up above you higher and higher ; and you shall come down lower and lower .
the man who is tender among you , and very de@@ licate , his eye shall be ev@@ il toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the re@@ mn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;

then men shall say , " Bec@@ ause they for@@ so@@ ok the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and shall return to Yah@@ we@@ h your God , and shall obe@@ y his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l ;
that then Yah@@ we@@ h your God will turn your cap@@ tivity , and have comp@@ as@@ sion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Yah@@ we@@ h your God has sc@@ at@@ tered you .
if your out@@ casts are in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the heav@@ ens , from there will Yah@@ we@@ h your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
Yah@@ we@@ h your God will circum@@ c@@ ise your heart , and the heart of your se@@ ed , to love Yah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your sou@@ l , that you may live .
I den@@ oun@@ ce to you this day , that you shall su@@ rely per@@ ish ; you shall not prol@@ ong your days in the land , where you pass over the Jordan to go in to poss@@ ess it .
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Yah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Mos@@ es wrote this law , and delivered it to the pri@@ ests the sons of L@@ evi , who b@@ ore the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , and to all the el@@ ders of Israel .
and that their children , who have not known , may hear , and learn to fear Yah@@ we@@ h your God , as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to poss@@ ess it . "
when the Most High gave to the nations their inher@@ it@@ ance , when he separated the children of men , he set the bo@@ unds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel .
he made him ride on the high places of the ear@@ th . he ate the increase of the field . he caused him to su@@ ck hon@@ ey out of the rock , oil out of the f@@ lin@@ ty rock ;
I will make my ar@@ ro@@ ws dr@@ un@@ k with blood . my s@@ word shall dev@@ our f@@ les@@ h with the blood of the sla@@ in and the cap@@ tives , from the head of the leaders of the enemy . "
and die on the mountain where you go up , and be gathered to your people , as Aaron your brother died on Mount H@@ or , and was gathered to his people :
because you t@@ res@@ passed against me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel at the waters of Mer@@ i@@ bah of K@@ ade@@ sh , in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in ; because you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t sanc@@ ti@@ fy me in the mid@@ st of the children of Israel .
they shall call the peoples to the mountain . there they will offer sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es of righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , for they shall draw out the ab@@ und@@ ance of the seas , the hidden treasures of the s@@ and . "
from the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and this Lebanon , even to the great river , the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all the land of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
it happened about the time of the sh@@ utting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out . where the men went , I don '@@ t know . pursue them quickly ; for you will over@@ take them . "
as soon as we had heard it , our hear@@ ts mel@@ ted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God in heav@@ en above , and on ear@@ th ben@@ e@@ ath .
then she let them down by a cor@@ d through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
it happened , when all the people had completely passed over , that the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h passed over , with the pri@@ ests , in the presence of the people .
this is the reason Jos@@ hua circum@@ c@@ ised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were mal@@ es , even all the men of war , died in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
it was so , that when Jos@@ hua had spoken to the people , the seven pri@@ ests bearing the seven tr@@ ump@@ ets of r@@ ams ' hor@@ ns before Yah@@ we@@ h advanced , and ble@@ w the tr@@ ump@@ ets ; and the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h followed them .
but as for you , only keep yo@@ ur@@ selves from the devoted thing , lest when you have devoted it , you take of the devoted thing ; so would you make the camp of Israel accur@@ sed , and trouble it .
they bur@@ n@@ t the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of br@@ ass and of iron into the treas@@ ury of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
the men of A@@ I struck about thirty @@@ -@@ @ six men of them , and they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even to She@@ bar@@ im , and struck them at the des@@ cent . the hear@@ ts of the people mel@@ ted , and became like water .
he brought near his household man by man , and A@@ ch@@ an , the son of Car@@ mi , the son of Z@@ ab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tri@@ be of Ju@@ da@@ h , was selected .
they took them from the middle of the tent , and brought them to Jos@@ hua and to all the children of Israel . they laid them down before Yah@@ we@@ h .
so Jos@@ hua ar@@ ose , and all the people of war , to go up to A@@ I . Jos@@ hua chose thirty thousand men , the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , and sent them out by night .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
it shall be , when you have seized on the city , that you shall set the city on fire . you shall do this according to the word of Yah@@ we@@ h . be@@ hold , I have comman@@ ded you . "
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their amb@@ ush on the west of the city ; and Jos@@ hua went that night into the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley .
the amb@@ ush ar@@ ose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stret@@ ched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
for Jos@@ hua di@@ d@@ n '@@ t draw back his hand , with which he stret@@ ched out the j@@ av@@ elin , until he had ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ I .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , be@@ hold , it is d@@ ry , and has become m@@ ol@@ dy .
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with them , that they heard that they were their neigh@@ b@@ ors , and that they lived among them .
it happened , when Jos@@ hua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great sla@@ ughter until they were consu@@ med , and the re@@ mn@@ ant which remained of them had entered into the for@@ ti@@ fied cities ,
they did so , and brought those five kings out of the cave to him : the king of Jer@@ usalem , the king of He@@ br@@ on , the king of Jar@@ mut@@ h , the king of L@@ ach@@ ish , and the king of Eg@@ lon .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the s@@ word . he ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed all the so@@ ul@@ s who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
it happened , when J@@ ab@@ in king of Haz@@ or heard of it , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ a@@ b king of Mad@@ on , to the king of Sh@@ im@@ ron , to the king of A@@ ch@@ shap@@ h ,
and to the kings who were on the north , in the hill country , in the Ara@@ bah south of Ch@@ in@@ ner@@ o@@ th , in the low@@ land , and in the he@@ ights of D@@ or on the west ,
to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and the Am@@ or@@ ite , and the H@@ itti@@ te , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite in the hill country , and the H@@ iv@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah .
Jos@@ hua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the s@@ word , and ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed them ; as Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded .
for it was of Yah@@ we@@ h to har@@ den their hear@@ ts , to come against Israel in battle , that he might ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy them , that they might have no fav@@ or , but that he might destroy them , as Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded Mos@@ es .
from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in of M@@ ede@@ ba to Di@@ bon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites : but G@@ es@@ hur and Ma@@ ac@@ ath d@@ well in the mid@@ st of Israel to this day .
their border was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the edge of the val@@ ley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the middle of the val@@ ley , and all the pla@@ in by M@@ ede@@ ba ;
Mos@@ es gave an inher@@ it@@ ance to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h . it was for the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h according to their families .
the lot for the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h according to their families was to the border of E@@ dom , even to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward , at the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the south .
and it went out sou@@ th@@ ward of the as@@ cent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and went up by the south of K@@ ade@@ sh Bar@@ nea , and passed along by H@@ ez@@ ron , went up to Ad@@ dar , and turned about to Kar@@ ka ;
the border went up to Beth Ho@@ g@@ lah , and passed along by the north of Beth Ara@@ bah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ ep@@ h@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath J@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount J@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
and the border went out to the side of E@@ kr@@ on nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border extended to Shi@@ k@@ ker@@ on , and passed along to Mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out at J@@ ab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
to Cal@@ e@@ b the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h he gave a portion among the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , according to the comman@@ d@@ ment of Yah@@ we@@ h to Jos@@ hua , even Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba , named after the father of An@@ ak ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) .
from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah the border went along w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard to the Bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inher@@ it@@ ance of the tri@@ be of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families ;
together with the cities which were set apart for the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in the mid@@ st of the inher@@ it@@ ance of the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , all the cities with their villages .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced la@@ bor , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ut@@ ter@@ ly drive them out .
they shall divide it into seven por@@ tions . Ju@@ da@@ h shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the lot of the tri@@ be of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Joseph .
it extended nor@@ th@@ ward , went out at En She@@ mes@@ h , and went out to Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the as@@ cent of Ad@@ um@@ m@@ im . it went down to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
it turned toward the sun@@ rise to Beth D@@ agon , and reached to Ze@@ bul@@ un , and to the val@@ ley of I@@ ph@@ ta@@ h El nor@@ th@@ ward to Beth E@@ mek and Ne@@ i@@ el . it went out to Cab@@ ul on the left hand ,
Yah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jos@@ hua , saying ,
the children of Mer@@ ari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tri@@ be of Re@@ ub@@ en , out of the tri@@ be of G@@ ad , and out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un .
they gave out of the tri@@ be of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and out of the tri@@ be of the children of Simeon , these cities which are mentioned by name :
and they were for the children of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites , who were of the children of L@@ evi ; for the@@ ir@@ s was the first lot .
the families of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , the L@@ evi@@ tes , even the rest of the children of Ko@@ hat@@ h , had the cities of their lot out of the tri@@ be of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the L@@ evi@@ tes , out of the tri@@ be of Ze@@ bul@@ un , Jok@@ ne@@ am with its subur@@ bs , Kar@@ ta@@ h with its subur@@ bs ,
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole Con@@ gre@@ gation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , to go up against them to war .
the children of Israel sent to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , and to the children of G@@ ad , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tri@@ be of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ azar the pri@@ est ,
and with him ten pr@@ inces , one pr@@ ince of a fa@@ thers ' house for each of the tri@@ bes of Israel ; and they were everyone of them head of their fa@@ thers ' houses among the thousands of Israel .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their go@@ ds , nor cause to swe@@ ar by them , neither serve them , nor bo@@ w down yo@@ ur@@ selves to them ;
I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dro@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the Am@@ ori@@ tes ; not with your s@@ word , nor with your bo@@ w .
he showed them the entrance into the city ; and they struck the city with the edge of the s@@ word ; but they let the man go and all his family .
the Am@@ ori@@ tes forced the children of Dan into the hill country ; for they would not allow them to come down to the val@@ ley ;
but the Am@@ ori@@ tes would d@@ well in Mount Her@@ es , in A@@ ij@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prev@@ ailed , so that they became subject to forced la@@ bor .
it happened , when the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
the children of Israel again did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Yah@@ we@@ h strengthened Eg@@ lon the king of Mo@@ a@@ b against Israel , because they had done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
they w@@ aited until they were as@@ ha@@ med ; and be@@ hold , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t open the doors of the up@@ per room : therefore they took the key , and opened them , and be@@ hold , their lor@@ d was fallen down dead on the ear@@ th .
it happened , when he had come , that he ble@@ w a tr@@ ump@@ et in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country , and he before them .
they struck of Mo@@ a@@ b at that time about ten thousand men , every lu@@ st@@ y man , and every man of val@@ or ; and there escaped not a man .
Sis@@ era gathered together all his char@@ i@@ ots , even nine hundred char@@ i@@ ots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Har@@ os@@ het@@ h of the Gen@@ ti@@ les , to the river K@@ ish@@ on .
she put her hand to the tent pe@@ g , and her right hand to the work@@ men 's ham@@ mer . with the ham@@ mer she struck Sis@@ era . she struck through his head . yes , she pi@@ er@@ ced and struck through his temp@@ les .
" so let all your enem@@ ies per@@ ish , Yah@@ we@@ h , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest for@@ ty years .
the hand of Mi@@ dian prev@@ ailed against Israel ; and because of Mi@@ dian the children of Israel made them the den@@ s which are in the mountains , and the c@@ aves , and the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds .
so it was , when Israel had so@@ wn , that the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites came up , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the children of the east ; they came up against them ;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and out of the hand of all who op@@ pressed you , and dro@@ ve them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the o@@ ak which was in O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ r@@ ite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ e@@ press , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and build an alt@@ ar to Yah@@ we@@ h your God on the top of this stron@@ gh@@ old , in an or@@ derly way , and take the second bul@@ l , and offer a bur@@ n@@ t offering with the wood of the Ash@@ er@@ ah which you shall cut down . "
the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the val@@ ley like loc@@ ust@@ s for multi@@ tude ; and their ca@@ me@@ ls were without number , as the s@@ and which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore for multi@@ tude .
it happened , as soon as G@@ ide@@ on was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and played the pro@@ stitute after the Ba@@ als , and made Ba@@ al Ber@@ ith their go@@ d .
the children of Israel di@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enem@@ ies on every side ;
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set an amb@@ ush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they ro@@ bbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch .
G@@ a@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
A@@ bi@@ me@@ le@@ ch , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
but there was a strong to@@ wer within the city , and there fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut themselves in , and went up to the ro@@ of of the to@@ wer .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h was kin@@ d@@ led against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the children of Am@@ mon .
the people , the pr@@ inces of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , said one to another , " What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Am@@ mon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad . "
then J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered v@@ ain fel@@ lows to J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and they went out with him .
it was so , that when the children of Am@@ mon made war against Israel , the el@@ ders of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad went to get J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah out of the land of To@@ b ;
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ ep@@ h@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may de@@ part and go down on the mountains , and be@@ wa@@ il my vir@@ gin@@ ity , I and my compan@@ ions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she was a vir@@ gin . it was a cust@@ om in Israel ,
when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing gra@@ in of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and bur@@ n@@ t up both the shocks and the standing gra@@ in , and also the olive gro@@ ves .
when the people saw him , they praised their go@@ d ; for they said , " Our go@@ d has delivered our enemy and the destro@@ yer of our country , who has sla@@ in many of us , into our hand . "
the man depar@@ ted out of the city , out of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , to live where he could find a place , and he came to the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he trav@@ eled .
the six hundred men gir@@ t with their weapons of war , who were of the children of Dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
so they sat down , ate , and d@@ rank , both of them together : and the young la@@ dy 's father said to the man , " P@@ le@@ ase be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
when they were by Je@@ bus , the day was far spent ; and the ser@@ vant said to his master , " P@@ le@@ ase come and let us turn aside into this city of the Je@@ bu@@ sites , and lo@@ dge in it . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lo@@ dge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lo@@ dge .
be@@ hold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Benj@@ am@@ ites .
he lifted up his eyes , and saw the w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city ; and the old man said , " W@@ here are you going ? where did you come from ? "
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the people , the men of Israel , encouraged themselves , and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they tr@@ usted the amb@@ ush@@ ers whom they had set against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
but when the cl@@ oud began to arise up out of the city in a pil@@ lar of smoke , the Benj@@ am@@ ites looked behind them ; and be@@ hold , the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; but the battle followed hard after them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its mid@@ st .
they found among the inhabitants of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ g@@ ins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wi@@ ves , according to their number , of those who dan@@ ced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inher@@ it@@ ance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel depar@@ ted there at that time , every man to his tri@@ be and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inher@@ it@@ ance .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
then she fell on her face , and bo@@ wed her@@ self to the ground , and said to him , " Wh@@ y have I found fav@@ or in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreig@@ ner ? "
now , my daughter , don '@@ t be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a wor@@ thy woman .
when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ ls , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of me@@ al , and a bot@@ tle of wine , and brought him to Yah@@ we@@ h 's house in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h . the child was young .
now E@@ li was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of Meet@@ ing .
be@@ hold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
I will raise me up a fa@@ ith@@ ful pri@@ est , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my ano@@ in@@ ted fore@@ ver .
it happened at that time , when E@@ li was laid down in his place ( now his eyes had begun to grow dim , so that he could not see ) ,
about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her , " D@@ on '@@ t be afraid ; for you have given birth to a son . " but she di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer , neither did she regard it .
when they of Ash@@ do@@ d ar@@ ose early on the next day , be@@ hold , D@@ agon was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h . they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
they of Beth She@@ mes@@ h were re@@ ap@@ ing their wheat har@@ v@@ est in the val@@ ley ; and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the Ar@@ k , and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed to see it .
the c@@ art came into the field of Jos@@ hua of Beth She@@ mes@@ h , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they split the wood of the c@@ art , and offered up the co@@ ws for a bur@@ n@@ t offering to Yah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " D@@ on '@@ t ce@@ ase to cry to Yah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
Yah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and served other go@@ ds , so do they also to you .
he had a son , whose name was Sa@@ ul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his sho@@ ul@@ ders and up@@ ward he was higher than any of the people .
when they had come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Sa@@ ul said to his ser@@ vant who was with him , " C@@ ome , and let us return , lest my father stop car@@ ing about the don@@ ke@@ ys , and be anx@@ ious for us . "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the k@@ ing@@ dom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Yah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a stra@@ it ( for the people were dist@@ ressed ) , then the people hi@@ d themselves in c@@ aves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in ro@@ cks , and in cover@@ ts , and in p@@ its .
it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the bur@@ n@@ t offering , be@@ hold , Samuel came ; and Sa@@ ul went out to meet him , that he might gre@@ et him .
but now your k@@ ing@@ dom shall not continue . Yah@@ we@@ h has sought for himself a man after his own heart , and Yah@@ we@@ h has appointed him to be pr@@ ince over his people , because you have not kept that which Yah@@ we@@ h comman@@ ded you . "
the sp@@ o@@ ilers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to O@@ ph@@ ra@@ h , to the land of Sh@@ ual ;
that first sla@@ ughter , which Jon@@ athan and his arm@@ or be@@ ar@@ er made , was about twenty men , within as it were half a fur@@ row 's length in an ac@@ re of land .
Sa@@ ul and all the people who were with him were gathered together , and came to the battle : and be@@ hold , every man 's s@@ word was against his fellow : a very great conf@@ usion .
now the H@@ eb@@ re@@ ws who were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Isra@@ eli@@ tes who were with Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan .
likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , when they heard that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
now the sons of Sa@@ ul were Jon@@ athan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ is@@ hua ; and the names of his two da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ a@@ b , and the name of the younger Mic@@ hal :
and the name of Sa@@ ul 's wife was Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the daughter of Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az . the name of the captain of his army was Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , Sa@@ ul 's un@@ cle .
he had a hel@@ met of br@@ ass on his head , and he was cla@@ d with a co@@ at of mail ; and the weight of the co@@ at was five thousand sh@@ ek@@ els of br@@ ass .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of B@@ eth@@ le@@ hem Ju@@ da@@ h , whose name was J@@ es@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Sa@@ ul , stric@@ ken among men .
the three el@@ dest sons of J@@ es@@ se had gone after Sa@@ ul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eli@@ a@@ b the fir@@ st@@ born , and next to him A@@ bin@@ ad@@ a@@ b , and the third Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h .
as he talked with them , be@@ hold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , Gol@@ i@@ ath by name , out of the ranks of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and s@@ lun@@ g it , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his fore@@ head ; and the stone san@@ k into his fore@@ head , and he fell on his face to the ear@@ th .
so David prev@@ ailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no s@@ word in the hand of David .
it happened , when he had made an end of speaking to Sa@@ ul , that the sou@@ l of Jon@@ athan was k@@ n@@ it with the sou@@ l of David , and Jon@@ athan lov@@ ed him as his own sou@@ l .
Jon@@ athan stri@@ pped himself of the ro@@ be that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clo@@ thing , even to his s@@ word , and to his bo@@ w , and to his s@@ ash .
Sa@@ ul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spe@@ ar ; but he slipped away out of Sa@@ ul 's presence , and he st@@ uck the spe@@ ar into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jon@@ athan stood up , and Ab@@ ner sat by Sa@@ ul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
so Jon@@ athan ar@@ ose from the table in fierce an@@ ger , and ate no food the second day of the month ; for he was gri@@ ev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him sh@@ ame .
now a certain man of the servants of Sa@@ ul was there that day , detained before Yah@@ we@@ h ; and his name was Do@@ e@@ g the E@@ dom@@ ite , the best of the her@@ d@@ s@@ men who belonged to Sa@@ ul .
then the Z@@ ip@@ hi@@ tes came up to Sa@@ ul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , " Do@@ es@@ n '@@ t David hide himself with us in the stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of the de@@ sert ?
Sa@@ ul and his men went to seek him . when David was told , he went down to the rock , and stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on . when Sa@@ ul heard that , he pursu@@ ed David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Ma@@ on .
it happened , when Sa@@ ul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , " be@@ hold , David is in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of En Ge@@ di . "
so David checked his men with these words , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t allow them to rise against Sa@@ ul . Sa@@ ul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Sa@@ ul , that Sa@@ ul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Sa@@ ul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
swe@@ ar now therefore to me by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you will not cut off my se@@ ed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose pos@@ sessions were in Car@@ mel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand she@@ ep , and a thousand go@@ ats : and he was S@@ hearing his she@@ ep in Car@@ mel .
ple@@ ase for@@ give the t@@ res@@ pass of your hand@@ ma@@ id . for Yah@@ we@@ h will certainly make my lor@@ d a sure house , because my lor@@ d fights the batt@@ les of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and ev@@ il shall not be found in you all your days .
it shall come to pass , when Yah@@ we@@ h has done to my lor@@ d according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you , and shall have appointed you pr@@ ince over Israel ,
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " G@@ o up in peace to your house . be@@ hold , I have list@@ ened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
then Sa@@ ul ar@@ ose , and went down to the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Z@@ ip@@ h .
Sa@@ ul en@@ camp@@ ed in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before the de@@ sert , by the way . but David stayed in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and he saw that Sa@@ ul came after him into the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
now therefore , don '@@ t let my blood fall to the ear@@ th away from the presence of Yah@@ we@@ h ; for the king of Israel has come out to seek a fle@@ a , as when one hun@@ ts a par@@ tri@@ dge in the mountains . "
David lived with A@@ ch@@ ish at G@@ ath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wi@@ ves , Ah@@ in@@ o@@ am the J@@ ez@@ re@@ eli@@ tes@@ s , and A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the Car@@ me@@ li@@ tes@@ s , Nab@@ al 's wife .
David struck the land , and sav@@ ed neither man nor woman alive , and took away the she@@ ep , and the c@@ attle , and the don@@ ke@@ ys , and the ca@@ me@@ ls , and the clo@@ thing ; and he returned , and came to A@@ ch@@ ish .
now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamen@@ ted him , and buried him in Ram@@ ah , even in his own city . Sa@@ ul had put away those who had familiar spir@@ its , and the w@@ iz@@ ards , out of the land .
Yah@@ we@@ h has done to you as he spoke by me . Yah@@ we@@ h has torn the k@@ ing@@ dom out of your hand , and given it to your neigh@@ bor , even to David .
is not this David , of whom they san@@ g one to another in dan@@ ces , saying , ' Sa@@ ul has sla@@ in his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lor@@ d who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , de@@ part . "
it happened , when David and his men had come to Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had made a raid on the South , and on Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and had struck Z@@ ik@@ la@@ g , and burned it with fire ,
when David and his men came to the city , be@@ hold , it was burned with fire ; and their wi@@ ves , and their sons , and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , were taken cap@@ tive .
then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and we@@ pt , until they had no more power to we@@ ep .
David struck them from the tw@@ il@@ ight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who ro@@ de on ca@@ me@@ ls and fled .
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount G@@ il@@ bo@@ a , be@@ hold , Sa@@ ul was le@@ an@@ ing on his spe@@ ar ; and be@@ hold , the char@@ i@@ ots and the hor@@ se@@ men followed hard after him .
they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fas@@ ted until evening , for Sa@@ ul , and for Jon@@ athan his son , and for the people of Yah@@ we@@ h , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the s@@ word .
( and he comman@@ ded them to te@@ ach the children of Ju@@ da@@ h the song of the bo@@ w : be@@ hold , it is written in the book of Jas@@ har ) :
the men of Ju@@ da@@ h came , and there they ano@@ in@@ ted David king over the house of Ju@@ da@@ h . they told David , saying , " The men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad were those who buried Sa@@ ul . "
David sent mes@@ sen@@ gers to the men of J@@ ab@@ es@@ h G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , and said to them , " b@@ les@@ sed are you by Yah@@ we@@ h , that you have shown this kin@@ d@@ ness to your lor@@ d , even to Sa@@ ul , and have buried him .
and his second , Ch@@ il@@ e@@ a@@ b , of A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the wife of Nab@@ al the Car@@ mel@@ ite ; and the third , Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Tal@@ ma@@ i king of G@@ es@@ hur ;
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the e@@ ars of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the e@@ ars of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
your hands were not bound , nor your feet put into f@@ et@@ ters . as a man falls before the children of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , so you fell . " all the people we@@ pt again over him .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall stir yo@@ ur@@ self up ; for then Yah@@ we@@ h has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
so David would not move the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h to be with him in the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
they brought in the Ar@@ k of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the mid@@ st of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings and peace offer@@ ings before Yah@@ we@@ h .
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sle@@ ep with your fa@@ thers , I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall proceed out of your bo@@ wel@@ s , and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
now when Jo@@ a@@ b saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syri@@ ans :
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syri@@ ans had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ a@@ b returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened at evening , that David ar@@ ose from off his bed , and walked on the ro@@ of of the king 's house : and from the ro@@ of he saw a woman ba@@ thing ; and the woman was very beautiful to look on .
it shall be that , if the king 's wr@@ ath arise , and he asks you , ' Wh@@ y did you go so near to the city to fight ? D@@ id@@ n '@@ t you know that they would sho@@ ot from the wall ?
she had a gar@@ ment of various col@@ ors on her ; for with such rob@@ es were the king 's da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who were vir@@ g@@ ins d@@ ressed . then his ser@@ vant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had comman@@ ded . then all the king 's sons ar@@ ose , and every man got up on his mul@@ e , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sla@@ in all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and be@@ hold , many people were coming by way of the hil@@ l@@ side behind him .
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that be@@ hold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt . the king also and all his servants we@@ pt bit@@ ter@@ ly .
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his fo@@ ot even to the cro@@ wn of his head there was no ble@@ mis@@ h in him .
it happened that when David had come to the top , where God was wor@@ shi@@ ped , be@@ hold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his co@@ at torn , and ear@@ th on his head .
D@@ on '@@ t you have Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests there with you ? therefore it shall be , that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king 's house , you shall tell it to Zad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the pri@@ ests .
be@@ hold , they have there with them their two sons , Ah@@ im@@ a@@ az , Zad@@ ok 's son , and Jon@@ athan , A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men were on his right hand and on his left .
even he who is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will ut@@ ter@@ ly mel@@ t ; for all Israel knows that your father is a m@@ igh@@ ty man , and those who are with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ro@@ pes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there is@@ n '@@ t one small stone found there . "
Ab@@ sal@@ om set A@@ masa over the army instead of Jo@@ a@@ b . now A@@ masa was the son of a man , whose name was I@@ th@@ ra the Isra@@ elite , who went in to A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , Jo@@ a@@ b 's mother .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the ro@@ of of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , be@@ hold , a man running alone .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Z@@ ib@@ a the ser@@ vant of the house of Sa@@ ul , and his fif@@ teen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
for your ser@@ vant knows that I have sin@@ ned . therefore be@@ hold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lor@@ d the king . "
there went out after him Jo@@ a@@ b 's men , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the P@@ ele@@ th@@ ites , and all the m@@ igh@@ ty men ; and they went out of Jer@@ usalem , to pursue after She@@ ba the son of B@@ ic@@ hri .
but the king spar@@ ed M@@ ep@@ hi@@ bos@@ het@@ h , the son of Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul , because of Yah@@ we@@ h 's oath that was between them , between David and Jon@@ athan the son of Sa@@ ul .
they buried the b@@ ones of Sa@@ ul and Jon@@ athan his son in the country of Benjamin in Z@@ ela , in the tomb of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king comman@@ ded . after that God was ent@@ re@@ ated for the land .
David spoke to Yah@@ we@@ h the words of this song in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h delivered him out of the hand of all his enem@@ ies , and out of the hand of Sa@@ ul :
you also have delivered me from the stri@@ v@@ ings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enem@@ ies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun rises , a morning without cl@@ ou@@ ds , when the tender gr@@ ass spr@@ ings out of the ear@@ th , through clear sh@@ ining after rain . '
after him was Sh@@ am@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of len@@ ti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the har@@ v@@ est time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ a@@ b , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ara@@ un@@ ah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
but Zad@@ ok the pri@@ est , and Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t , and Shi@@ me@@ i , and Re@@ i , and the m@@ igh@@ ty men who belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ on@@ ij@@ ah .
they told the king , saying , " be@@ hold , Na@@ than the pro@@ phe@@ t ! " when he had come in before the king , he bo@@ wed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , know for certain that you shall su@@ rely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
so the king comman@@ ded Ben@@ ai@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; and he went out , and fell on him , so that he died . the k@@ ing@@ dom was established in the hand of Solomon .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
when I rose in the morning to nur@@ se my child , be@@ hold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , be@@ hold , it was not my son , whom I b@@ ore . "
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri , in the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad , the country of S@@ ih@@ on king of the Am@@ ori@@ tes and of O@@ g king of B@@ ash@@ an ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
for he had domin@@ ion over all on this side the River , from Ti@@ ph@@ sa@@ h even to Gaza , over all the kings on this side the River : and he had peace on all sides around him .
besides Solomon 's chief officers who were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , who b@@ ore rule over the people who la@@ bo@@ red in the work .
against the wall of the house he built stories all around , against the walls of the house all around , both of the temp@@ le and of the or@@ acle ; and he made side rooms all around .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quar@@ ry ; and there was neither ham@@ mer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house : and they went up by win@@ ding st@@ airs into the middle story , and out of the middle into the third .
the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole alt@@ ar that belonged to the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
five cu@@ bi@@ ts was the one wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and five cu@@ bi@@ ts the other wing of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b : from the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the one wing to the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the other were ten cu@@ bi@@ ts .
his house where he was to d@@ well , the other court within the por@@ ch , was of the like work . he made also a house for P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this por@@ ch .
there were capitals above also on the two pil@@ lars , close by the bel@@ ly which was bes@@ ide the network : and the po@@ me@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred , in ro@@ ws around on the other capital .
he set up the pil@@ lars at the por@@ ch of the temp@@ le : and he set up the right pil@@ lar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pil@@ lar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
the four whe@@ els were under@@ ne@@ ath the pan@@ els ; and the ax@@ les of the whe@@ els were in the base : and the he@@ ight of a whe@@ el was a cu@@ bit and half a cu@@ bit .
the work of the whe@@ els was like the work of a char@@ i@@ ot whe@@ el : their ax@@ les , and their ri@@ ms , and their spok@@ es , and their nav@@ es , were all m@@ ol@@ ten .
the two pil@@ lars , and the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ; and the two networks to cover the two bo@@ w@@ ls of the capitals that were on the top of the pil@@ lars ;
and the po@@ ts , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ins : even all these vessels , which H@@ i@@ ram made for king Solomon , in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , were of bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , who were assemb@@ led to him , were with him before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
he said , " b@@ les@@ sed is Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who spoke with his m@@ outh to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
there I have set a place for the Ar@@ k , in which is the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fa@@ thers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
yet have respect for the pray@@ er of your ser@@ vant , and for his supp@@ lic@@ ation , Yah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the pray@@ er which your ser@@ vant pr@@ ays before you this day ;
listen to the supp@@ lic@@ ation of your ser@@ vant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pra@@ y toward this place . yes , hear in heav@@ en , your d@@ wel@@ ling place ; and when you hear , for@@ give .
" moreover concerning the foreig@@ ner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
( for they shall hear of your great name , and of your m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and of your out@@ stret@@ ched arm ) ; when he shall come and pra@@ y toward this house ;
it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing all this pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation to Yah@@ we@@ h , he ar@@ ose from before the alt@@ ar of Yah@@ we@@ h , from k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing on his k@@ ne@@ es with his hands spread forth toward heav@@ en .
that he may inc@@ line our hear@@ ts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his comman@@ d@@ ments , and his stat@@ utes , and his ord@@ inan@@ ces , which he comman@@ ded our fa@@ thers .
it happened , when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house , and all Solomon 's desire which he was pleased to do ,
then I will establish the th@@ r@@ one of your k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel fore@@ ver , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the th@@ r@@ one of Israel . '
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be ast@@ on@@ ished , and shall his@@ s ; and they shall say , ' Wh@@ y has Yah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Yah@@ we@@ h and the king 's house
( now H@@ i@@ ram the king of T@@ y@@ re had fur@@ n@@ ished Solomon with c@@ ed@@ ar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave H@@ i@@ ram twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ il@@ ee .
P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and bur@@ n@@ t it with fire , and sla@@ in the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
as for all the people who were left of the Am@@ ori@@ tes , the H@@ itti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
besides that which the tr@@ aders brought , and the traffic of the mer@@ chan@@ ts , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the govern@@ ors of the country .
all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of p@@ ure gold : none were of silver ; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
however I will not tear away all the k@@ ing@@ dom ; but I will give one tri@@ be to your son , for David my ser@@ vant 's sake , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake which I have chosen . "
it happened at that time , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am went out of Jer@@ usalem , that the pro@@ phe@@ t A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cla@@ d himself with a new gar@@ ment ; and they two were alone in the field .
now the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wis@@ dom , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
it happened , when Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am lived in Egypt ,
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced la@@ bor ; and all Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his char@@ i@@ ot , to flee to Jer@@ usalem .
it happened , after he had e@@ aten bread , and after he had dr@@ un@@ k , that he s@@ add@@ led the don@@ key for the pro@@ phe@@ t whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the don@@ key stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
be@@ hold , men passed by , and saw the body cast in the way , and the lion standing by the body ; and they came and told it in the city where the old pro@@ phe@@ t lived .
the pro@@ phe@@ t took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the don@@ key , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old pro@@ phe@@ t to mour@@ n , and to bur@@ y him .
he who dies of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the do@@ gs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . " '
the rest of the acts of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am , how he war@@ red , and how he re@@ ig@@ ned , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel .
Ju@@ da@@ h did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , and they provoked him to je@@ al@@ ous@@ y with their sin@@ s which they committed , above all that their fa@@ thers had done .
and he took away the treasures of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all : and he took away all the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
now the rest of the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ?
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside from anything that he comman@@ ded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of U@@ ri@@ ah the H@@ itti@@ te .
the rest of the acts of A@@ bi@@ j@@ am , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h ? there was war between A@@ bi@@ j@@ am and Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am .
he brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
for the sin@@ s of Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provoc@@ ation with which he provoked Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to an@@ ger .
now the rest of the acts of Nad@@ a@@ b , and all that he did , ar@@ en '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les of the kings of Israel ?

twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h his God , like David his father .
but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , yes , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations , whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel .
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
the bronze alt@@ ar , which was before Yah@@ we@@ h , he brought from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the house , from between his alt@@ ar and the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and put it on the north side of his alt@@ ar .
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a took Samar@@ ia , and carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and placed them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Yah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , and had fear@@ ed other go@@ ds ,
the children of Israel did secre@@ tly things that were not right against Yah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the to@@ wer of the watch@@ men to the for@@ ti@@ fied city ;
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , they would not listen , but har@@ dened their nec@@ k , like the nec@@ k of their fa@@ thers , who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe in Yah@@ we@@ h their God .
he tr@@ usted in Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that S@@ hal@@ man@@ eser king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a came up against Samar@@ ia , and bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed it .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and put them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of G@@ oz@@ an , and in the cities of the Me@@ des ,
at that time , H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le , and from the pil@@ lars which H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
now therefore , ple@@ ase give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
neither let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , who was over the household , came with She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of A@@ sap@@ h the rec@@ order , to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah with their clo@@ th@@ es torn , and told him the words of R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h .
it happened , when king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clo@@ th@@ es , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and went into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
be@@ hold , I will put a spirit in him , and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the s@@ word in his own land . " ' "
'@@ Th@@ us you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , " D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , Jer@@ usalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
have the go@@ ds of the nations delivered them , which my fa@@ thers have destroyed , G@@ oz@@ an , and Har@@ an , and Re@@ z@@ eph , and the children of E@@ den that were in Tel@@ assa@@ r ?
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
ha@@ ven '@@ t you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yo@@ urs to lay waste for@@ ti@@ fied cities into ru@@ in@@ ous he@@ aps .
" therefore thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , ' He shall not come to this city , nor sho@@ ot an ar@@ row there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a mo@@ und against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened that night , that the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out , and struck one hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
it happened , before I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah had gone out into the middle part of the city , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying ,
'@@ O@@ f your sons who shall issue from you , whom you shall father , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on . ' "
because they have done that which is ev@@ il in my sight , and have provoked me to an@@ ger , since the day their fa@@ thers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
Am@@ on was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned two years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ le@@ me@@ th the daughter of Har@@ uz of J@@ ot@@ bah .
but the people of the land killed all those who had consp@@ ired against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jos@@ i@@ ah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in all the way of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eigh@@ teen@@ th year of king Jos@@ i@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of Mes@@ h@@ ul@@ lam , the s@@ cri@@ be , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
" go up to H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah the high pri@@ est , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , which the ke@@ epers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Ju@@ da@@ h has read .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing , Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn from the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of his great wr@@ ath , with which his an@@ ger was kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , because of all the provoc@@ ation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .

the king of Egypt di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come again out of his land any more ; for the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on had taken , from the Bro@@ ok of Egypt to the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive the resi@@ due of the people who were left in the city , and those who fell away , who fell to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and the resi@@ due of the multi@@ tude .
the captain of the guard took away the fire p@@ ans , the bas@@ ins , that which was of gold , in gold , and that which was of silver , in silver .
and for his allow@@ ance , there was a contin@@ ual allow@@ ance given him of the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .
Jok@@ tan became the father of Al@@ mo@@ dad , and She@@ le@@ p@@ h , and H@@ azar@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Jer@@ ah ,

some of them also were appointed over the furniture , and over all the vessels of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , and over the fine fl@@ our , and the wine , and the oil , and the fran@@ k@@ incen@@ se , and the sp@@ ices .
Mat@@ ti@@ th@@ i@@ ah , one of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who was the fir@@ st@@ born of S@@ hal@@ lum the Kor@@ ah@@ ite , had the office of trust over the things that were bak@@ ed in p@@ ans .
these are the singers , heads of fa@@ thers ' households of the L@@ evi@@ tes , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
when all the men of Israel who were in the val@@ ley saw that they fled , and that Sa@@ ul and his sons were dead , they for@@ so@@ ok their cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were en@@ camp@@ ed in the val@@ ley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
these are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had over@@ flow@@ ed all its banks ; and they put to flight all them of the val@@ ley@@ s , both toward the east , and toward the west .
so David di@@ d@@ n '@@ t move the Ar@@ k to him into the city of David , but carried it aside into the house of Ob@@ ed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ itti@@ te .
it shall be , when you hear the sound of mar@@ ching in the tops of the mul@@ ber@@ ry trees , that then you shall go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
so the L@@ evi@@ tes appointed H@@ eman the son of Jo@@ el ; and of his brothers , A@@ sap@@ h the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah ; and of the sons of Mer@@ ari their brothers , E@@ than the son of Kus@@ ha@@ i@@ ah ;

so he left there , before the Ar@@ k of the C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of Yah@@ we@@ h , A@@ sap@@ h and his brothers , to minister before the Ar@@ k continu@@ ally , as every day 's work required ;
to offer bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings to Yah@@ we@@ h on the alt@@ ar of bur@@ n@@ t offering continu@@ ally morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he comman@@ ded to Israel ;
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel , to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another .
I have been with you wher@@ ever you have gone , and have cut off all your enem@@ ies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the ear@@ th .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fa@@ thers , that I will set up your se@@ ed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his k@@ ing@@ dom .
Jo@@ a@@ b gave up the sum of the num@@ ber@@ ing of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew s@@ word : and in Ju@@ da@@ h were four hundred sev@@ enty thousand men who drew s@@ word .
as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and bo@@ wed himself to David with his face to the ground .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instruc@@ ted in singing to Yah@@ we@@ h , even all who were s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful , was two hundred eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ eight .

over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the tow@@ ers , was Jon@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :

both ri@@ ches and hon@@ or come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every pr@@ ince in all Israel , the heads of the fa@@ thers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tent of Meet@@ ing of God , which Mos@@ es the ser@@ vant of Yah@@ we@@ h had made in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness .
moreover the bronze alt@@ ar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , was there before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Yah@@ we@@ h : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking coun@@ sel there .
then Solomon began to build the house of Yah@@ we@@ h at Jer@@ usalem on Mount Mor@@ i@@ ah , where Yah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the th@@ res@@ hing floor of Or@@ nan the J@@ eb@@ us@@ ite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cu@@ bi@@ ts after the first measure was six@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
he over@@ laid also the house , the be@@ ams , the th@@ res@@ holds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and en@@ gra@@ ved ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m on the walls .
the w@@ ings of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m were twenty cu@@ bi@@ ts long : the wing of the one was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cu@@ bi@@ ts , reaching to the wing of the other ch@@ er@@ u@@ b .
he set up the pil@@ lars before the temp@@ le , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand J@@ ach@@ in , and the name of that on the left Bo@@ az .
and they brought up the Ar@@ k , and the tent of Meet@@ ing , and all the hol@@ y vessels that were in the tent ; these the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes brought up .
King Solomon and all the Con@@ gre@@ gation of Israel , that were assemb@@ led to him , were before the Ar@@ k , sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing she@@ ep and c@@ attle , that could not be counted nor num@@ ber@@ ed for multi@@ tude .
the po@@ les were so long that the ends of the po@@ les were seen from the Ar@@ k before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
who have kept with your ser@@ vant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your m@@ outh , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
whatever pray@@ er and supp@@ lic@@ ation be made by any man , or by all your people Israel , who shall know every man his own pla@@ gue and his own sor@@ row , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enem@@ ies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pra@@ y to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
" now , my God , let , I be@@ g you , your eyes be open , and let your e@@ ars be atten@@ tive , to the pray@@ er that is made in this place .
now when Solomon had made an end of pray@@ ing , the fire came down from heav@@ en , and consu@@ med the bur@@ n@@ t offering and the sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; and the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have comman@@ ded you , and will keep my stat@@ utes and my ord@@ inan@@ ces ;
as for all the people who were left of the H@@ itti@@ tes , and the Am@@ ori@@ tes , and the Per@@ iz@@ zi@@ tes , and the H@@ i@@ vi@@ tes , and the Je@@ bu@@ sites , who were not of Israel ;
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and rul@@ ers of his char@@ i@@ ots and of his hor@@ se@@ men .
however I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t believe their words , until I came , and my eyes had seen it ; and be@@ hold , the half of the gre@@ at@@ ness of your wis@@ dom was not told me : you exceed the f@@ ame that I heard .
but he for@@ so@@ ok the coun@@ sel of the old men which they had given him , and took coun@@ sel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What coun@@ sel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Mak@@ e the yok@@ e that your father put on us ligh@@ ter ? ' "
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jer@@ usalem , he assemb@@ led the house of Ju@@ da@@ h and Benjamin , one hundred eigh@@ ty thousand chosen men , who were war@@ ri@@ ors , to fight against Israel , to bring the k@@ ing@@ dom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
for the L@@ evi@@ tes left their subur@@ bs and their possession , and came to Ju@@ da@@ h and Jer@@ usalem : for Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and his sons cast them off , that they should not exec@@ ute the pri@@ est 's office to Yah@@ we@@ h ;
it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was established , and he was strong , that he for@@ so@@ ok the law of Yah@@ we@@ h , and all Israel with him .
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of br@@ ass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
ought you not to know that Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , gave the k@@ ing@@ dom over Israel to David fore@@ ver , even to him and to his sons by a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of salt ?
yet Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am the son of N@@ eb@@ at , the ser@@ vant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and rebel@@ led against his lor@@ d .
then the men of Ju@@ da@@ h gave a sh@@ out : and as the men of Ju@@ da@@ h sh@@ ou@@ ted , it happened , that God struck Jer@@ o@@ bo@@ am and all Israel before A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah and Ju@@ da@@ h .
in those times there was no peace to him who went out , nor to him who came in ; but great troub@@ les were on all the inhabitants of the lands .
all Ju@@ da@@ h re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed at the oath ; for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and Yah@@ we@@ h gave them rest all around .
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ ninth year of his reign A@@ SA was dis@@ eased in his feet ; his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek Yah@@ we@@ h , but to the physi@@ cians .
they ta@@ ught in Ju@@ da@@ h , having the book of the law of Yah@@ we@@ h with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and ta@@ ught among the people .
this was the num@@ ber@@ ing of them according to their fa@@ thers ' houses : of Ju@@ da@@ h , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the char@@ i@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
the battle increased that day . however the king of Israel pro@@ pped himself up in his char@@ i@@ ot against the Syri@@ ans until the evening ; and about the time of the going down of the sun , he died .
it happened after this , that the children of Mo@@ a@@ b , and the children of Am@@ mon , and with them some of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , came against J@@ eh@@ os@@ ha@@ ph@@ at to battle .
then the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h came on Ja@@ haz@@ i@@ el the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of Ben@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Je@@ i@@ el , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the Lev@@ ite , of the sons of A@@ sap@@ h , in the mid@@ st of the assembly ;
tomorrow go down against them . be@@ hold , they are coming up by the as@@ cent of Z@@ iz . you shall find them at the end of the val@@ ley , before the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness of Jer@@ uel .
the L@@ evi@@ tes , of the children of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites and of the children of the Kor@@ a@@ hi@@ tes , stood up to praise Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with an exceeding l@@ oud voice .
now when J@@ eh@@ or@@ am was risen up over the k@@ ing@@ dom of his father , and had strengthened himself , he killed all his brothers with the s@@ word , and various also of the pr@@ inces of Israel .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ ha@@ b ; for he had the daughter of A@@ ha@@ b as wife : and he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h .
it happened , when J@@ eh@@ u was exec@@ ut@@ ing judgment on the house of A@@ ha@@ b , that he found the pr@@ inces of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the sons of the brothers of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , minist@@ ering to A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , and killed them .
they went about in Ju@@ da@@ h , and gathered the L@@ evi@@ tes out of all the cities of Ju@@ da@@ h , and the heads of fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , and they came to Jer@@ usalem .
a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation . all the people shall be in the courts of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but let no one come into the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , except the pri@@ ests , and those who minister of the L@@ evi@@ tes . they shall come in , for they are hol@@ y , but all the people shall follow Yah@@ we@@ h 's instruc@@ tions .
the L@@ evi@@ tes shall sur@@ round the king , every man with his weapons in his hand . who@@ ever comes into the house , let him be sla@@ in . be with the king when he comes in , and when he goes out . "
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the pri@@ est delivered to the cap@@ tains of hundreds the spe@@ ars , and bu@@ ck@@ lers , and shi@@ elds , that had been king David 's , which were in God 's house .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the alt@@ ar and the house , around the king .
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the hor@@ se gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
now it happened , when the k@@ ing@@ dom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
then A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah separated them , the army that had come to him out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to go home again : therefore their an@@ ger was greatly kin@@ d@@ led against Ju@@ da@@ h , and they returned home in fierce an@@ ger .
the children of Ju@@ da@@ h carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
now from the time that A@@ maz@@ i@@ ah turned away from following Yah@@ we@@ h , they made a con@@ spir@@ acy against him in Jer@@ usalem . he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish ; but they sent after him to L@@ ach@@ ish , and killed him there .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Yah@@ we@@ h , God made him to prosp@@ er .
he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and broke down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of J@@ ab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d ; and he built cities in the country of Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the whole number of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , even the m@@ igh@@ ty men of val@@ or , was two thousand and six hundred .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ th@@ am , and all his wars , and his ways , be@@ hold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Ju@@ da@@ h .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned six@@ teen years in Jer@@ usalem : and he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , like David his father ;
moreover he bur@@ n@@ t incen@@ se in the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , and bur@@ n@@ t his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations whom Yah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for A@@ haz took away a portion out of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and out of the house of the king and of the pr@@ inces , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a : but it di@@ d@@ n '@@ t help him .
A@@ haz sle@@ pt with his fa@@ thers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jer@@ usalem ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t bring him into the tom@@ bs of the kings of Israel : and H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ ig@@ ned in his place .
H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah began to reign when he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old ; and he re@@ ig@@ ned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jer@@ usalem : and his mother 's name was A@@ bi@@ j@@ ah , the daughter of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah .
for our fa@@ thers have t@@ res@@ passed , and done that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ sak@@ en him , and have turned away their faces from the habi@@ tation of Yah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
moreover H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah the king and the pr@@ inces comman@@ ded the L@@ evi@@ tes to sing pra@@ ises to Yah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of A@@ sap@@ h the se@@ er . they san@@ g pra@@ ises with gla@@ d@@ ness , and they bo@@ wed their heads and wor@@ shi@@ ped .
they ar@@ ose and took away the al@@ tar@@ s that were in Jer@@ usalem , and all the al@@ tar@@ s for incen@@ se took they away , and cast them into the Bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
for H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h gave to the assembly for offer@@ ings one thousand bul@@ ls and seven thousand she@@ ep ; and the pr@@ inces gave to the assembly a thousand bul@@ ls and ten thousand she@@ ep : and a great number of pri@@ ests sanc@@ ti@@ fied themselves .
all the assembly of Ju@@ da@@ h , with the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Ju@@ da@@ h , re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfor@@ tably to them , saying ,
D@@ on '@@ t you know what I and my fa@@ thers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the go@@ ds of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the go@@ ds of those nations which my fa@@ thers ut@@ ter@@ ly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cri@@ ed with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jer@@ usalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ gh@@ ten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah hum@@ b@@ led himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , so that the wr@@ ath of Yah@@ we@@ h di@@ d@@ n '@@ t come on them in the days of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah .
now the rest of the acts of H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah , and his good de@@ eds , be@@ hold , they are written in the vision of I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t the son of A@@ mo@@ z , in the book of the kings of Ju@@ da@@ h and Israel .
he did that which was ev@@ il in the sight of Yah@@ we@@ h , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father ; and Am@@ on sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ed to all the en@@ gra@@ ved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
they delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who had the over@@ sight of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ; and the work@@ men who la@@ bo@@ red in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h gave it to mend and repair the house ;
" thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , ' be@@ hold , I will bring ev@@ il on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but to the king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who sent you to inqu@@ ire of Yah@@ we@@ h , thus you shall tell him , ' Th@@ us says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : " as tou@@ ching the words which you have heard ,
prepare yo@@ ur@@ selves after your fa@@ thers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
stand in the hol@@ y place according to the divisions of the fa@@ thers ' houses of your brothers the children of the people , and let there be for each a portion of a fa@@ thers ' house of the L@@ evi@@ tes .
they ro@@ asted the P@@ ass@@ over with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the hol@@ y offer@@ ings bo@@ iled they in po@@ ts , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
moreover all the chiefs of the pri@@ ests , and the people , t@@ res@@ passed very greatly after all the ab@@ omin@@ ations of the nations ; and they pollu@@ ted the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which he had made hol@@ y in Jer@@ usalem .
Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fa@@ thers , sent to them by his mes@@ sen@@ gers , rising up early and sending , because he had comp@@ as@@ sion on his people , and on his d@@ wel@@ ling place :
the children of the por@@ ters : the children of S@@ hal@@ lum , the children of A@@ ter , the children of Tal@@ mon , the children of Ak@@ ku@@ b , the children of H@@ ati@@ ta , the children of Sho@@ ba@@ i , in all one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ nine .
of the children of the pri@@ ests : the children of Hab@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
some of the heads of fa@@ thers ' households , when they came to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h which is in Jer@@ usalem , offered will@@ ingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the alt@@ ar on its base ; and they offered bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings on it to Yah@@ we@@ h , even bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings morning and evening .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tri@@ bute , cust@@ om , or toll , and in the end it will be hur@@ t@@ ful to the kings .
I decre@@ ed , and search has been made , and it is found that this city of old time has made insur@@ rec@@ tion against kings , and that rebel@@ lion and se@@ di@@ tion have been made there@@ in .
then when the cop@@ y of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Sh@@ im@@ s@@ hai the s@@ cri@@ be , and their compan@@ ions , they went in has@@ te to Jer@@ usalem to the Jews , and made them to ce@@ ase by force and power .
but the eye of their God was on the el@@ ders of the Jews , and they did not make them ce@@ ase , until the matter should come to Dar@@ i@@ us , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
then the same Sh@@ es@@ h@@ baz@@ z@@ ar came , and laid the foundations of God 's house which is in Jer@@ usalem : and since that time even until now has it been in building , and yet it is not completed .
they set the pri@@ ests in their divisions , and the L@@ evi@@ tes in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jer@@ usalem ; as it is written in the book of Mos@@ es .
the children of Israel who had come again out of the cap@@ tivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the fil@@ th@@ iness of the nations of the land , to seek Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ate ,
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the pri@@ ests , and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the singers , and the por@@ ters , and the N@@ eth@@ in@@ im , to Jer@@ usalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jer@@ usalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , in my real@@ m , who are min@@ ded of their own free will to go to Jer@@ usalem , go with you .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
whatever is comman@@ ded by the God of heav@@ en , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heav@@ en ; for why should there be wr@@ ath against the real@@ m of the king and his sons ?
now these are the heads of their fa@@ thers ' households , and this is the gen@@ e@@ alo@@ gy of those who went up with me from Bab@@ yl@@ on , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ x@@ es the king :
watch , and keep them , until you we@@ igh them before the chiefs of the pri@@ ests and the L@@ evi@@ tes , and the pr@@ inces of the fa@@ thers ' households of Israel , at Jer@@ usalem , in the rooms of the house of Yah@@ we@@ h . "
when I heard this thing , I t@@ ore my gar@@ ment and my ro@@ be , and p@@ lu@@ cked off the ha@@ ir of my head and of my be@@ ard , and sat down con@@ founded .
and I said , " My God , I am as@@ ha@@ med and b@@ lus@@ h to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities have increased over our head , and our guil@@ tin@@ ess has grown up to the heav@@ ens .
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days ; and I fas@@ ted and pray@@ ed before the God of heav@@ en ,
when San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and To@@ bi@@ ah the ser@@ vant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it gri@@ ev@@ ed them exce@@ ed@@ ingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
Mal@@ chi@@ j@@ ah the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , the ru@@ ler of the district of Beth Hac@@ ch@@ er@@ em rep@@ aired the D@@ ung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
it happened , when our enem@@ ies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their coun@@ sel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
they all built the wall and those who b@@ ore bur@@ den@@ s loaded themselves ; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work , and with the other held his weapon ;
of the pri@@ ests : the children of H@@ ob@@ ai@@ ah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Bar@@ zil@@ la@@ i the G@@ il@@ e@@ adi@@ te , and was called after their name .
moreover , in a pil@@ lar of cl@@ oud you led them by day ; and in a pil@@ lar of fire by night , to give them light in the way in which they should go .
you also multi@@ p@@ lied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fa@@ thers , that they should go in to poss@@ ess it .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spiri@@ t through your pro@@ ph@@ ets . yet would they not give e@@ ar . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
neither have our kings , our pr@@ inces , our pri@@ ests , nor our fa@@ thers , kept your law , nor list@@ ened to your comman@@ d@@ ments and your testimon@@ ies with which you testified against them .
for they have not served you in their k@@ ing@@ dom , and in your great Go@@ od@@ ness that you gave them , and in the large and rich land which you gave before them , neither did they turn from their w@@ ic@@ ked works .
" be@@ hold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fa@@ thers to eat its fruit and its good , be@@ hold , we are servants in it .
and to bring the first fru@@ its of our ground , and the first fru@@ its of all fruit of all kinds of trees , year by year , to the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ;
and Ma@@ ase@@ i@@ ah the son of Bar@@ u@@ ch , the son of Col@@ ho@@ z@@ e@@ h , the son of Haz@@ ai@@ ah , the son of A@@ dai@@ ah , the son of Jo@@ i@@ ar@@ i@@ b , the son of Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah , the son of the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite .
the sons of L@@ evi , heads of fa@@ thers ' households , were written in the book of the chron@@ ic@@ les , even until the days of Johan@@ an the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
and certain of the pri@@ ests ' sons with tr@@ ump@@ ets : Z@@ ec@@ har@@ i@@ ah the son of Jon@@ athan , the son of Sh@@ em@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Mat@@ tan@@ i@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ai@@ ah , the son of Z@@ acc@@ ur , the son of A@@ sap@@ h ;
by the spring gate , and stra@@ ight before them , they went up by the st@@ airs of the city of David , at the as@@ cent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eas@@ tw@@ ard .
on that day they read in the book of Mos@@ es in the audience of the people ; and there@@ in was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ abi@@ te should not enter into the assembly of God fore@@ ver ,
I perceived that the por@@ tions of the L@@ evi@@ tes had not been given them ; so that the L@@ evi@@ tes and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
there lived men of T@@ y@@ re also there@@ in , who brought in fish , and all kinds of war@@ es , and sold on the Sab@@ b@@ ath to the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and in Jer@@ usalem .
one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high pri@@ est , was son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to San@@ bal@@ lat the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
now it happened in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us who re@@ ig@@ ned from India even to Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , over one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven provinces ) ,
that in those days , when the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the th@@ r@@ one of his k@@ ing@@ dom , which was in Sh@@ us@@ han the palace ,
in accordance with the law , the drinking was not comp@@ ul@@ sory ; for so the king had instruc@@ ted all the officials of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleas@@ ure .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ es@@ h , who were do@@ or@@ ke@@ epers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
then Es@@ ther called for H@@ ath@@ ach , one of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , whom he had appointed to attend her , and comman@@ ded him to go to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then Ham@@ an went out that day jo@@ y@@ ful and glad of heart , but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t stand up nor move for him , he was filled with wr@@ ath against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
Ham@@ an re@@ counted to them the gl@@ ory of his ri@@ ches , the multi@@ tude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the pr@@ inces and servants of the king .
on that night , the king co@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t sle@@ ep . he comman@@ ded the book of records of the chron@@ ic@@ les to be brought , and they were read to the king .
then Es@@ ther the qu@@ een answ@@ ered , " If I have found fav@@ or in your sight , O king , and if it ple@@ ase the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
a cop@@ y of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ en@@ ge themselves on their enem@@ ies .
they killed Par@@ sh@@ an@@ da@@ th@@ a , Dal@@ ph@@ on , A@@ sp@@ ath@@ a ,
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three s@@ ist@@ ers to eat and to drink with them .
Yah@@ we@@ h said to S@@ atan , " W@@ here have you come from ? " then S@@ atan answ@@ ered Yah@@ we@@ h , and said , " From going back and forth in the ear@@ th , and from walk@@ ing up and down in it . "
as for that night , let th@@ ick d@@ ark@@ ness se@@ ize on it . let it not re@@ jo@@ ice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
let the stars of its tw@@ il@@ ight be dark . let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the ey@@ eli@@ ds of the morning ,
" my sou@@ l is we@@ ary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bit@@ ter@@ ness of my sou@@ l .
" ' why , then , have you brought me forth out of the w@@ om@@ b ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me .
in the thought of him who is at ease there is con@@ temp@@ t for mis@@ fortun@@ e . it is ready for them whose fo@@ ot sli@@ ps .
you also put my feet in the sto@@ cks , and mark all my p@@ aths . you set a bound to the so@@ les of my feet ,
I was at ease , and he broke me apart . yes , he has taken me by the nec@@ k , and d@@ ashed me to pieces . he has also set me up for his target .

when my spirit was overwhel@@ med within me , you knew my path . in the way in which I walk , they have hidden a sn@@ are for me .
for the enemy pursu@@ es my sou@@ l . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
I also will la@@ ug@@ h at your disaster . I will mo@@ ck when cal@@ am@@ ity over@@ takes you ;
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sle@@ ep will be swe@@ et .
for it is better that it be said to you , " C@@ ome up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the pr@@ ince , whom your eyes have seen .
D@@ on '@@ t for@@ sake your friend and your father 's friend . D@@ on '@@ t go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neigh@@ bor who is near than a distant brother .
the way of an e@@ ag@@ le in the air ; the way of a ser@@ p@@ ent on a rock ; the way of a ship in the mid@@ st of the sea ; and the way of a man with a ma@@ iden .
there is no memory of the former ; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come , among those that shall come after .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wis@@ dom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be aff@@ lic@@ ted with .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but wo@@ e to him who is alone when he falls , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have another to lift him up .
D@@ on '@@ t be ras@@ h with your m@@ outh , and don '@@ t let your heart be has@@ ty to ut@@ ter anything before God ; for God is in heav@@ en , and you on ear@@ th . therefore let your words be few .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
in the day of prosperity be jo@@ y@@ ful , and in the day of ad@@ versity consider ; yes , God has made the one side by side with the other , to the end that man should not find out anything after him .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don '@@ t withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wis@@ dom and the scheme of things , and to know that w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is st@@ up@@ idity , and that fo@@ ol@@ ishness is mad@@ ness .
which my sou@@ l still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
when I applied my heart to know wis@@ dom , and to see the business that is done on the ear@@ th ( for also there is that neither day nor night sees sle@@ ep with his eyes ) ,
D@@ on '@@ t cur@@ se the king , no , not in your th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and don '@@ t cur@@ se the rich in your bed@@ room : for a bird of the sky may carry your voice , and that which has w@@ ings may tell the matter .
if the cl@@ ou@@ ds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the ear@@ th ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
in the day when the ke@@ epers of the house shall tre@@ m@@ ble , and the strong men shall bo@@ w themselves , and the gr@@ in@@ ders ce@@ ase because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are dar@@ ken@@ ed ,
D@@ on '@@ t st@@ are at me because I am dark , because the sun has scor@@ ched me . my mother 's sons were angry with me . they made me keep@@ er of the v@@ ine@@ yards . I ha@@ ven '@@ t kept my own v@@ ine@@ yard .
my do@@ ve in the cle@@ fts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountain@@ side , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is swe@@ et , and your face is lov@@ ely .
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the s@@ quar@@ es I will seek him whom my sou@@ l lov@@ es . I sought him , but I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t find him .
go forth , you da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and see king Solomon , with the cro@@ wn with which his mother has crow@@ ned him , in the day of his w@@ ed@@ dings , in the day of the gla@@ d@@ ness of his heart . L@@ over
O@@ h that you were like my brother , who nur@@ sed from the bre@@ asts of my mother ! if I found you outside , I would k@@ is@@ s you ; yes , and no one would desp@@ ise me .
from the sole of the fo@@ ot even to the head there is no so@@ und@@ ness in it : wounds , wel@@ ts , and open so@@ res . they ha@@ ven '@@ t been closed , neither ban@@ da@@ ged , neither so@@ o@@ th@@ ed with oil .
it shall happen in the latter days , that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be raised above the hil@@ ls ; and all nations shall flow to it .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of hor@@ ses , neither is there any end of their char@@ i@@ ots .
for there will be a day of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies for all that is proud and ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
the people will be op@@ pressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neigh@@ bor . the child will be@@ have himself pro@@ u@@ dly against the old man , and the base against the hon@@ or@@ able .
when the Lord shall have was@@ hed away the Fil@@ th of the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of Z@@ ion , and shall have p@@ urged the blood of Jer@@ usalem from its mid@@ st , by the spirit of justice , and by the spirit of burning .
what could have been done more to my v@@ ine@@ yard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grap@@ es , did it yield wild grap@@ es ?
now I will tell you what I will do to my v@@ ine@@ yard . I will take away its h@@ edge , and it will be e@@ aten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tr@@ amp@@ led down .
Wo@@ e to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to d@@ well alone in the mid@@ st of the land !
who say , " Let him make speed , let him has@@ ten his work , that we may see it ; and let the coun@@ sel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
none shall be we@@ ary nor st@@ um@@ ble among them ; none shall s@@ lum@@ ber nor sle@@ ep ; neither shall the bel@@ t of their wa@@ ist be un@@ tied , nor the lat@@ ch@@ et of their sho@@ es be broken :
" let 's go up against Ju@@ da@@ h , and tear it apart , and let 's divide it among ourselves , and set up a king in its mid@@ st , even the son of T@@ ab@@ e@@ el . "
it will happen in that day that Yah@@ we@@ h will wh@@ ist@@ le for the fly that is in the ut@@ ter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the be@@ e that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a .
in that day the Lord will s@@ have with a ra@@ zor that is hired in the parts beyond the River , even with the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , the head and the ha@@ ir of the feet ; and it shall also consum@@ e the be@@ ard .
all the hil@@ ls that were cultiv@@ ated with the ho@@ e , you shall not come there for fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of she@@ ep . "
now therefore , be@@ hold , the Lord brings upon them the m@@ igh@@ ty flood waters of the River : the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a and all his gl@@ ory . it will come up over all its channels , and go over all its banks .
they will pass through it , very dist@@ ressed and hun@@ gry ; and it will happen that when they are hun@@ gry , they will worry , and cur@@ se by their king and by their God . they will turn their faces up@@ ward ,
for all the arm@@ or of the armed man in the no@@ is@@ y battle , and the gar@@ ments rol@@ led in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
what will you do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the de@@ so@@ lation which will come from af@@ ar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
it will happen in that day , that his burden will de@@ part from off your sho@@ ul@@ der , and his yok@@ e from off your nec@@ k , and the yok@@ e shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
be@@ hold , God is my sal@@ vation . I will trust , and will not be afraid ; for Y@@ ah , Yah@@ we@@ h , is my strength and song ; and he has become my sal@@ vation . "
for the stars of the sky and its con@@ ste@@ l@@ lations will not give their light . the sun will be dar@@ ken@@ ed in its going forth , and the moon will not cause its light to sh@@ ine .
it will happen that like a hun@@ ted gaz@@ elle , and like she@@ ep that no one ga@@ thers , they will each turn to their own people , and will each flee to their own land .
their bo@@ ws will d@@ ash the young men in pieces ; and they shall have no p@@ ity on the fruit of the w@@ om@@ b . their eyes will not spar@@ e children .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Ara@@ bi@@ an will not pit@@ ch a tent there , neither will she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds make their f@@ loc@@ ks lie down there .
for Yah@@ we@@ h will have comp@@ as@@ sion on Jac@@ o@@ b , and will yet choose Israel , and set them in their own land . the foreig@@ ner will join himself with them , and they will unite with the house of Jac@@ o@@ b .
it will happen in the day that Yah@@ we@@ h will give you rest from your sor@@ row , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an in my land , and tre@@ ad him under fo@@ ot on my mountains . then his yok@@ e will leave them , and his burden leave their sho@@ ul@@ ders .
my heart cri@@ es out for Mo@@ a@@ b ! her no@@ bles flee to Zo@@ ar , to Eg@@ la@@ th S@@ hel@@ ish@@ iy@@ ah ; for they go up by the as@@ cent of Lu@@ hit@@ h with we@@ eping ; for in the way of Hor@@ on@@ aim , they raise up a cry of destruction .
a th@@ r@@ one will be established in lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , jud@@ ging , seeking justice , and swift to do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
they will not look to the al@@ tar@@ s , the work of their hands ; neither shall they respect that which their fin@@ gers have made , either the Ash@@ er@@ im , or the incen@@ se al@@ tar@@ s .
in the day of your plan@@ ting , you h@@ edge it in . in the morning , you make your se@@ ed b@@ los@@ so@@ m , but the har@@ v@@ est fle@@ es away in the day of gri@@ ef and of desper@@ ate sor@@ row .
at evening , be@@ hold , terror ! before the morning , they are no more . this is the portion of those who pl@@ under us , and the lot of those who ro@@ b us .
for before the har@@ v@@ est , when the b@@ los@@ so@@ m is over , and the f@@ lower becomes a ri@@ pen@@ ing gra@@ pe , he will cut off the sp@@ ri@@ gs with pr@@ un@@ ing ho@@ oks , and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches .
Yah@@ we@@ h has mixed a spirit of per@@ ver@@ sen@@ ess in the mid@@ st of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go as@@ tra@@ y in all of its works , like a dr@@ un@@ ken man stag@@ gers in his v@@ om@@ it .
the land of Ju@@ da@@ h will become a terror to Egypt . everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid , because of the plans of Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , which he determin@@ es against it .
and I will clo@@ the him with your ro@@ be , and strengthen him with your bel@@ t . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jer@@ usalem , and to the house of Ju@@ da@@ h .
I will lay the key of the house of David on his sho@@ ul@@ der . he will open , and no one will shut . he will shut , and no one will open .
they will han@@ g on him all the gl@@ ory of his father 's house , the off@@ spring and the issue , every small ves@@ sel , from the c@@ ups even to all the pit@@ chers .
it will happen after the end of sev@@ enty years that Yah@@ we@@ h will visit T@@ y@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th .
the ear@@ th will stag@@ ger like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and will s@@ way back and forth like a ham@@ mo@@ ck . its dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the p@@ it , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
as the heat in a d@@ ry place will you bring down the no@@ ise of st@@ ran@@ gers ; as the heat by the sha@@ de of a cl@@ oud , the song of the dre@@ aded ones will be brought low .
he will spread out his hands in its mid@@ st , like one who sw@@ ims sp@@ reads out hands to sw@@ im , but his pride will be hum@@ b@@ led together with the craft of his hands .
for he has brought down those who d@@ well on high , the lo@@ f@@ ty city . he lays it low . he lays it low even to the ground . he brings it even to the d@@ ust .
with my sou@@ l have I desi@@ red you in the night . yes , with my spirit within me will I seek you ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly ; for when your judg@@ ments are in the ear@@ th , the inhabitants of the world learn righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
when he has lev@@ eled its sur@@ face , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he plant the d@@ ill , and sc@@ at@@ ter the cum@@ in se@@ ed , and put in the wheat in ro@@ ws , the bar@@ ley in the appointed place , and the sp@@ el@@ t in its place ?
for the d@@ ill are not th@@ res@@ hed with a sharp instrument , neither is a c@@ art whe@@ el turned over the cum@@ in ; but the d@@ ill is beaten out with a stick , and the cum@@ in with a ro@@ d .
but the multi@@ tude of your fo@@ es will be like fine d@@ ust , and the multi@@ tude of the ru@@ th@@ less ones like c@@ haf@@ f that blo@@ ws away . yes , it will be in an in@@ stan@@ t , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
Is@@ n '@@ t it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruit@@ ful field , and the fruit@@ ful field will be regarded as a forest ?
in that day , the de@@ af will hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the b@@ lin@@ d will see out of ob@@ sc@@ urity and out of d@@ ark@@ ness .
and when you turn to the right hand , and when you turn to the left , your e@@ ars will hear a voice behind you , saying , " This is the way . walk in it . "
you shall def@@ ile the over@@ lay@@ ing of your en@@ gra@@ ved images of silver , and the pla@@ ting of your m@@ ol@@ ten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an un@@ clean thing . you shall tell it , " G@@ o away ! "
his bre@@ ath is as an over@@ flow@@ ing stream that reaches even to the nec@@ k , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of destruction ; and a bri@@ dle that leads to ru@@ in will be in the j@@ a@@ ws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a hol@@ y feast is kept ; and gla@@ d@@ ness of heart , as when one goes with a fl@@ ute to come to Yah@@ we@@ h 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
every stro@@ ke of the ro@@ d of punishment , which Yah@@ we@@ h will lay on him , will be with the sound of tam@@ bour@@ ines and har@@ ps . he will fight with them in batt@@ les , br@@ and@@ ishing weapons .
yet he also is wise , and will bring disaster , and will not call back his words , but will arise against the house of the ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , and against the help of those who work in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity .
you will no longer see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that you can '@@ t compre@@ hend , with a st@@ range language that you can '@@ t understand .
their sla@@ in will also be cast out , and the st@@ en@@ ch of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will mel@@ t in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dis@@ solved . the sky will be rol@@ led up like a s@@ cr@@ oll , and all its armies will fade away , as a le@@ af f@@ ades from off a v@@ ine or a fi@@ g tree .
the wild animals of the de@@ sert will meet with the w@@ ol@@ ves , and the wild go@@ at will cry to his fellow . yes , the night cre@@ ature shall settle there , and shall find her@@ self a place of rest .
it will b@@ los@@ so@@ m ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly , and re@@ jo@@ ice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's gl@@ ory Lebanon will be given to it , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of Car@@ mel and Shar@@ on . they will see Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory , the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of our God .
now therefore , ple@@ ase make a pledge to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a , and I will give you two thousand hor@@ ses , if you are able on your part to set ri@@ ders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for char@@ i@@ ots and for hor@@ se@@ men ?
then R@@ ab@@ shak@@ e@@ h stood , and called out with a l@@ oud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " He@@ ar the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a !
D@@ on '@@ t let H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah make you trust in Yah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Yah@@ we@@ h will su@@ rely deliver us . this city won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . " '
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the s@@ cri@@ be , and the el@@ ders of the pri@@ ests , covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
so the servants of king H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah came to I@@ sa@@ i@@ ah .
" thus you shall speak to H@@ ez@@ ek@@ i@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h , saying , ' D@@ on '@@ t let your God in whom you trust dec@@ e@@ ive you , saying , " Jer@@ usalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a . "
and have cast their go@@ ds into the fire ; for they were no go@@ ds , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
by the way that he came , by the same he shall return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the an@@ gel of Yah@@ we@@ h went out and struck one hundred and eigh@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand men in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans . when men ar@@ ose early in the morning , be@@ hold , these were all dead bodies .
be@@ hold , for peace I had great an@@ gu@@ ish , but you have in love for my sou@@ l delivered it from the p@@ it of corruption ; for you have cast all my sin@@ s behind your back .
'@@ Beh@@ old , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fa@@ thers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Bab@@ yl@@ on . nothing will be left , ' says Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will come as a m@@ igh@@ ty one , and his arm will rule for him . be@@ hold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ compen@@ se before him .
he will fe@@ ed his flock like a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d . he will gather the lam@@ bs in his arm , and carry them in his bos@@ om . he will g@@ ently lead those who have their young .
it is he who s@@ its above the circ@@ le of the ear@@ th , and its inhabitants are like gr@@ ass@@ hop@@ pers ; who stret@@ ches out the heav@@ ens like a cur@@ tain , and sp@@ reads them out like a tent to d@@ well in ;
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the ear@@ th , and called from its cor@@ ners , and said to you , ' You are my ser@@ vant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
you will seek them , and won '@@ t find them , even those who conten@@ d with you . those who war against you will be as nothing , as a non @@@ -@@ @ ex@@ istent thing .
I will open rivers on the b@@ are he@@ ights , and spr@@ ings in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley@@ s . I will make the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a pool of water , and the d@@ ry land spr@@ ings of water .
Yah@@ we@@ h will go out like a m@@ igh@@ ty man . he will stir up z@@ e@@ al like a man of war . he will raise a war cry . yes , he will sh@@ out al@@ oud . he will triumph over his enem@@ ies .
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not over@@ flow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and fla@@ me will not scor@@ ch you .
the animals of the field shall hon@@ or me , the j@@ ac@@ kal@@ s and the os@@ tri@@ ches ; because I give water in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness and rivers in the de@@ sert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have bought me no swe@@ et can@@ e with money , nor have you filled me with the f@@ at of your sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es ; but you have burdened me with your sin@@ s . you have we@@ ar@@ ied me with your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities .
be@@ hold , all his fel@@ lows will be disappointed ; and the work@@ men are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to sh@@ ame together .
" I will go before you , and make the roug@@ h places smooth . I will break the doors of br@@ ass in pieces , and cut apart the bars of iron .
I will give you the treasures of d@@ ark@@ ness , and hidden ri@@ ches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Yah@@ we@@ h , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none besides me . I am Yah@@ we@@ h , and there is no one else .
" assem@@ ble yo@@ ur@@ selves and come . draw near together , you who have escaped from the nations . those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their en@@ gra@@ ved image , and pra@@ y to a go@@ d that can '@@ t save .
calling a ra@@ ven@@ ous bird from the east , the man of my coun@@ sel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have pur@@ posed , I will also do it .
you said , ' I shall be a mist@@ ress fore@@ ver ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have la@@ bo@@ red : those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall w@@ ander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my m@@ outh , and I showed them : su@@ d@@ den@@ ly I did them , and they happened .
yes , my hand has laid the foundation of the ear@@ th , and my right hand has spread out the heav@@ ens : when I call to them , they stand up together .
they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t thir@@ st when he led them through the de@@ ser@@ ts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters gus@@ hed out .
who is among you who fears Yah@@ we@@ h , who obe@@ ys the voice of his ser@@ vant ? he who walk@@ s in d@@ ark@@ ness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , you who seek Yah@@ we@@ h : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the p@@ it you were du@@ g from .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
for you shall not go out in has@@ te , neither shall you go by flight : for Yah@@ we@@ h will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your re@@ ar guard .
so shall he sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le many nations ; kings shall shut their m@@ ou@@ ths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
for he grew up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of d@@ ry ground . he has no good looks or maj@@ es@@ ty . when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
for you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left ; and your se@@ ed shall poss@@ ess the nations , and make the de@@ so@@ late cities to be inhabited .
for the mountains may de@@ part , and the hil@@ ls be removed ; but my lov@@ ing kin@@ d@@ ness shall not de@@ part from you , neither shall my C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant of peace be removed , " says Yah@@ we@@ h who has mer@@ cy on you .
in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness you shall be established : you shall be far from op@@ pression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
let the w@@ ic@@ ked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous man his th@@ ou@@ ghts ; and let him return to Yah@@ we@@ h , and he will have mer@@ cy on him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly par@@ don .
for as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t return there , but waters the ear@@ th , and makes it bring forth and bu@@ d , and gives se@@ ed to the so@@ wer and bread to the e@@ ater ;
yes , the do@@ gs are gre@@ edy , they can never have enough ; and these are she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds who can '@@ t understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
be@@ hold , you fast for stri@@ fe and contention , and to strike with the f@@ ist of w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess : you don '@@ t fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high .
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your he@@ aling shall spring forth spe@@ edil@@ y ; and your righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness shall go before you ; the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h shall be your re@@ ar guard .
their we@@ bs shall not become gar@@ ments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the b@@ lin@@ d ; yes , we gro@@ pe as those who have no eyes : we st@@ um@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the tw@@ il@@ ight ; among those who are lu@@ st@@ y we are as dead men .
he put on righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness as a bre@@ ast@@ pla@@ te , and a hel@@ met of sal@@ vation on his head ; and he put on gar@@ ments of ven@@ ge@@ ance for clo@@ thing , and was cla@@ d with z@@ e@@ al as a man@@ tle .
then you shall see and be radi@@ ant , and your heart shall th@@ r@@ ill and be en@@ lar@@ ged ; because the ab@@ und@@ ance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness shall the moon give light to you : but Yah@@ we@@ h will be to you an ever@@ lasting light , and your God your gl@@ ory .
but you shall be named the pri@@ ests of Yah@@ we@@ h ; men will call you the ministers of our God : you will eat the wealth of the nations , and you will bo@@ ast in their gl@@ ory .
for as the ear@@ th brings forth its bu@@ d , and as the gar@@ den causes the things that are so@@ wn in it to spring forth ; so the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h will cause righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jer@@ usalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness go forth as bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness , and her sal@@ vation as a lam@@ p that bur@@ ns .
you meet him who re@@ jo@@ ices and works righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness , those who remember you in your ways . be@@ hold , you were angry , and we sin@@ ned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be sav@@ ed ?
for we have all become as one who is un@@ clean , and all our righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is as a pollu@@ ted gar@@ ment : and we all fade as a le@@ af ; and our in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , like the wind , take us away .
" I am inqu@@ ired of by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t ask ; I am found by those who di@@ d@@ n '@@ t seek me : I said , Se@@ e me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
I will re@@ jo@@ ice in Jer@@ usalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of we@@ eping and the voice of cr@@ ying .
I will ut@@ ter my judg@@ ments against them tou@@ ching all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , in that they have for@@ sak@@ en me , and have burned incen@@ se to other go@@ ds , and wor@@ shi@@ ped the works of their own hands .
" ha@@ ven '@@ t you proc@@ ured this to yo@@ ur@@ self , in that you have for@@ sak@@ en Yah@@ we@@ h your God , when he led you by the way ?
" but where are your go@@ ds that you have made for yo@@ ur@@ selves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h .
also the blood of the so@@ ul@@ s of the innocent poor is found in your sk@@ ir@@ ts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
" yet you said , ' I am innocent . su@@ rely his an@@ ger has turned away from me . ' " be@@ hold , I will judge you , because you say , ' I have not sin@@ ned . '
in those days the house of Ju@@ da@@ h shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inher@@ it@@ ance to your fa@@ thers .
then will I cause you to d@@ well in this place , in the land that I gave to your fa@@ thers , from of old even fore@@ ver@@ more .
but go now to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ o@@ h , where I caused my name to d@@ well at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Yah@@ we@@ h , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t hear ; and I called you , but you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer :
for I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak to your fa@@ thers , nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , concerning bur@@ n@@ t offer@@ ings or sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es :
I list@@ ened and heard , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t speak ar@@ ight : no man re@@ pen@@ ts him of his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess , saying , What have I done ? everyone turns to his course , as a hor@@ se that rus@@ hes head@@ long in the battle .
O@@ h that I had in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness a lo@@ d@@ ging place of w@@ ay@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of t@@ reac@@ her@@ ous men .
and let them make has@@ te , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with te@@ ars , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our pal@@ aces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
for the customs of the peoples are van@@ ity ; for one cuts a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the work@@ man with the ax@@ e .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my cur@@ tains .
for according to the number of your cities are your go@@ ds , Ju@@ da@@ h ; and according to the number of the streets of Jer@@ usalem have you set up al@@ tar@@ s to the sha@@ me@@ ful thing , even al@@ tar@@ s to bur@@ n incen@@ se to Ba@@ al .
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with you ; even they have cri@@ ed al@@ oud after you : D@@ on '@@ t believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
D@@ est@@ ro@@ yers have come on all the b@@ are he@@ ights in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness ; for the s@@ word of Yah@@ we@@ h dev@@ ours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no f@@ les@@ h has peace .
it shall happen , after that I have p@@ lu@@ cked them up , I will return and have comp@@ as@@ sion on them ; and I will bring them again , every man to his heritage , and every man to his land .
then I went to the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates , and du@@ g , and took the bel@@ t from the place where I had hidden it ; and be@@ hold , the bel@@ t was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
the cities of the South are shut up , and there is none to open them : Ju@@ da@@ h is carried away cap@@ tive , all of it ; it is wh@@ ol@@ ly carried away cap@@ tive .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yo@@ ur@@ self ta@@ ught to be friends to you ? shall not sor@@ ro@@ ws take hold of you , as of a woman in trav@@ ail ?
I have win@@ no@@ wed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
their wi@@ dows are increased to me above the s@@ and of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destro@@ yer at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused an@@ gu@@ ish and terr@@ ors to fall on her su@@ d@@ den@@ ly .
for thus says Yah@@ we@@ h concerning the sons and concerning the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters who are born in this place , and concerning their mothers who b@@ ore them , and concerning their fa@@ thers who became their father in this land :
and you have done ev@@ il more than your fa@@ thers ; for , be@@ hold , you walk every one after the st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness of his ev@@ il heart , so that you don '@@ t listen to me :
the sin of Ju@@ da@@ h is written with a p@@ en of iron , and with the point of a di@@ am@@ ond : it is en@@ gra@@ ved on the tab@@ let of their heart , and on the hor@@ ns of your al@@ tar@@ s ;
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the de@@ sert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall in@@ ha@@ bit the par@@ ched places in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a salt land and not inhabited .
when the ves@@ sel that he made of the cla@@ y was marred in the hand of the P@@ ot@@ ter , he made it again another ves@@ sel , as seemed good to the P@@ ot@@ ter to make it .
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their ev@@ il , I will rep@@ ent of the ev@@ il that I thought to do to them .
if they do that which is ev@@ il in my sight , that they not obe@@ y my voice , then I will rep@@ ent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
and go forth to the val@@ ley of the son of Hin@@ no@@ m , which is by the entry of the gate Har@@ s@@ ith , and procla@@ im there the words that I shall tell you ;
then P@@ ash@@ hur struck Jerem@@ i@@ ah the pro@@ phe@@ t , and put him in the sto@@ cks that were in the up@@ per gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h .
be@@ hold , I am against you , O inhabi@@ tant of the val@@ ley , and of the rock of the pla@@ in , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; you that say , Wh@@ o shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habi@@ tations ?
say , He@@ ar the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , who s@@ its on the th@@ r@@ one of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the th@@ r@@ one of David , ri@@ ding in char@@ i@@ ots and on hor@@ ses , he , and his servants , and his people .
is this man Con@@ i@@ ah a desp@@ ised broken ves@@ sel ? is he a ves@@ sel in which none deli@@ ghts ? why are they cast out , he and his se@@ ed , and are cast into the land which they don '@@ t know ?
I will gather the re@@ mn@@ ant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruit@@ ful and multi@@ ply .
concerning the pro@@ ph@@ ets . my heart within me is broken , all my b@@ ones shake ; I am like a dr@@ un@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Yah@@ we@@ h , and because of his hol@@ y words .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the inten@@ ts of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will ut@@ ter@@ ly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fa@@ thers , away from my presence :
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : like these good fig@@ s , so will I regard the cap@@ tives of Ju@@ da@@ h , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for good .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah concerning all the people of Ju@@ da@@ h , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h ( the same was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) ,
Yah@@ we@@ h has sent to you all his servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not list@@ ened , nor inc@@ lined your e@@ ar to hear )
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the U@@ z , and all the kings of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ k@@ el@@ on , and Gaza , and E@@ kr@@ on , and the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms of the world , which are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th : and the king of Sh@@ es@@ h@@ ach shall drink after them .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may rep@@ ent me of the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them because of the ev@@ il of their do@@ ings .
to listen to the words of my servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , whom I send to you , even rising up early and sending them , but you have not list@@ ened ;
and they f@@ et@@ ched forth U@@ ri@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , who killed him with the s@@ word , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h , came this word to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
I have made the ear@@ th , the men and the animals that are on the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , by my great power and by my out@@ stret@@ ched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , my ser@@ vant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
then the pro@@ phe@@ t Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to the pro@@ phe@@ t Han@@ an@@ i@@ ah in the presence of the pri@@ ests , and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h ,
by the hand of E@@ las@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ar@@ i@@ ah the son of H@@ ilk@@ i@@ ah , ( whom Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah king of Ju@@ da@@ h sent to Bab@@ yl@@ on to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ) , saying ,
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , the God of Israel , to all the cap@@ tivity , whom I have caused to be carried away cap@@ tive from Jer@@ usalem to Bab@@ yl@@ on :
out of them shall proceed Than@@ k@@ s@@ giving and the voice of those who make mer@@ ry : and I will multi@@ ply them , and they shall not be few ; I will also g@@ lor@@ ify them , and they shall not be small .
be@@ hold , the storm of Yah@@ we@@ h , his wr@@ ath , has gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall bur@@ st on the head of the w@@ ic@@ ked .
su@@ rely after that I was turned , I re@@ pen@@ ted ; and after that I was instruc@@ ted , I struck on my th@@ igh : I was as@@ ha@@ med , yes , even con@@ founded , because I b@@ ore the re@@ pro@@ ach of my youth .
be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will so@@ w the house of Israel and the house of Ju@@ da@@ h with the se@@ ed of man , and with the se@@ ed of animal .
and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs , and with won@@ ders , and with a strong hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with great terror ;
for this city has been to me a provoc@@ ation of my an@@ ger and of my wr@@ ath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
moreover the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
I will cleans@@ e them from all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will par@@ don all their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
the word that came to Jerem@@ i@@ ah from Yah@@ we@@ h , after that the king Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah had made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with all the people who were at Jer@@ usalem , to procla@@ im liber@@ ty to them ;
that every man should let his male ser@@ vant , and every man his female ser@@ vant , who is a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w or a H@@ eb@@ re@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bon@@ d@@ servants of them , of a J@@ ew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ ma@@ ids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ ma@@ ids .
thus says Yah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : I made a C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant with your fa@@ thers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bon@@ da@@ ge , saying ,
we have obe@@ yed the voice of Jon@@ ad@@ a@@ b the son of Rec@@ ha@@ b , our father , in all that he comman@@ ded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wi@@ ves , our sons , or our da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ;
it may be that the house of Ju@@ da@@ h will hear all the ev@@ il which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his ev@@ il way ; that I may for@@ give their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah called Bar@@ u@@ ch the son of Ner@@ i@@ ah ; and Bar@@ u@@ ch wrote from the m@@ outh of Jerem@@ i@@ ah all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a s@@ cr@@ oll of a book .
they went in to the king into the court ; but they had laid up the s@@ cr@@ oll in the room of E@@ lis@@ h@@ ama the s@@ cri@@ be ; and they told all the words in the e@@ ars of the king .
for though you had struck the whole army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans who fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yes would they rise up every man in his tent , and bur@@ n this city with fire .
the pr@@ inces were angry with Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jon@@ athan the s@@ cri@@ be ; for they had made that the prison .
so they drew up Jerem@@ i@@ ah with the cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on : and Jerem@@ i@@ ah remained in the court of the guard .
then came all the pr@@ inces to Jerem@@ i@@ ah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had comman@@ ded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
then Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive into Bab@@ yl@@ on the resi@@ due of the people who remained in the city , the de@@ ser@@ ters also who fell away to him , and the resi@@ due of the people who remained .
but Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h , and gave them v@@ ine@@ yards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jerem@@ i@@ ah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Yah@@ we@@ h ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will su@@ rely save you , and you shall not fall by the s@@ word , but your life shall be for a pre@@ y to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also killed all the Jews who were with him , with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were found there , the men of war .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ p@@ ah to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , C@@ ome to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
it was so , when they came into the mid@@ st of the city , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah killed them , and cast them into the mid@@ st of the p@@ it , he , and the men who were with him .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the ev@@ il that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ an@@ i@@ ah had done ,
now it happened that , when all the people who were with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el saw Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , then they were glad .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
D@@ on '@@ t be afraid of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , of whom you are afraid ; don '@@ t be afraid of him , says Yah@@ we@@ h : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the tr@@ ump@@ et , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we d@@ well :
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obe@@ yed the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
it happened that , when Jerem@@ i@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Yah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
so Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h , to d@@ well in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kar@@ e@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the re@@ mn@@ ant of Ju@@ da@@ h , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y the voice of Yah@@ we@@ h : and they came to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
take great stones in your hand , and hide them in mort@@ ar in the bri@@ ck work , which is at the entry of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h 's house in Tah@@ pan@@ hes , in the sight of the men of Ju@@ da@@ h ;
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity , and such as are for the s@@ word to the s@@ word .
they are not hum@@ b@@ led even to this day , neither have they fear@@ ed , nor walked in my law , nor in my stat@@ utes , that I set before you and before your fa@@ thers .
for I will punish those who d@@ well in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jer@@ usalem , by the s@@ word , by the fam@@ ine , and by the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ;
then Jerem@@ i@@ ah said to all the people , to the men , and to the women , even to all the people who had given him an answer , saying ,
be@@ hold , I watch over them for ev@@ il , and not for good ; and all the men of Ju@@ da@@ h who are in the land of Egypt shall be consu@@ med by the s@@ word and by the fam@@ ine , until they are all gone .
of Egypt : concerning the army of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h Nec@@ o@@ h king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ up@@ h@@ rates in Car@@ chem@@ ish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar king of Bab@@ yl@@ on struck in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jos@@ i@@ ah , king of Ju@@ da@@ h .
why have I seen it ? they are dis@@ may@@ ed and are turned back@@ ward ; and their m@@ igh@@ ty ones are beaten down , and have fled Ap@@ ace , and don '@@ t look back : terror is on every side , says Yah@@ we@@ h .
the nations have heard of your sh@@ ame , and the ear@@ th is full of your cry ; for the m@@ igh@@ ty man has stumb@@ led against the m@@ igh@@ ty , they are fallen both of them together .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , says Yah@@ we@@ h , that I will send to him those who p@@ our off , and they shall p@@ our him off ; and they shall empty his vessels , and break their bott@@ les in pieces .
but I have made E@@ sa@@ u b@@ are , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his se@@ ed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neigh@@ b@@ ors ; and he is no more .
be@@ hold , he shall come up and fly as the e@@ ag@@ le , and spread out his w@@ ings against Boz@@ ra@@ h : and the heart of the m@@ igh@@ ty men of E@@ dom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pan@@ gs .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land de@@ so@@ late , and none shall d@@ well there@@ in : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
your mother shall be ut@@ ter@@ ly disappointed ; she who b@@ ore you shall be con@@ founded : be@@ hold , she shall be the least of the nations , a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert .
cut off the so@@ wer from Bab@@ yl@@ on , and him who hand@@ les the si@@ ck@@ le in the time of har@@ v@@ est : for fear of the op@@ pressing s@@ word they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Bab@@ yl@@ on , and you w@@ eren '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Yah@@ we@@ h .
Yah@@ we@@ h has opened his arm@@ ory , and has brought forth the weapons of his in@@ dign@@ ation ; for the Lord , Yah@@ we@@ h of Ar@@ m@@ ies , has a work to do in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
against him who ben@@ ds let the ar@@ cher b@@ end his bo@@ w , and against him who lif@@ ts himself up in his co@@ at of mail : and don '@@ t spar@@ e her young men ; ut@@ ter@@ ly destroy all her army .
flee out of the mid@@ st of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Yah@@ we@@ h 's ven@@ ge@@ ance ; he will ren@@ der to her a re@@ compen@@ se .
her cities are become a de@@ so@@ lation , a d@@ ry land , and a de@@ sert , a land in which no man d@@ wel@@ ls , neither does any son of man pass there@@ by .
therefore be@@ hold , the days come , that I will exec@@ ute judgment on the en@@ gra@@ ved images of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; and her whole land shall be con@@ founded ; and all her sla@@ in shall fall in the mid@@ st of her .
for through the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h it happened in Jer@@ usalem and Ju@@ da@@ h , until he had cast them out from his presence . Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah rebel@@ led against the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on .
in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the fam@@ ine was severe in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
he put out the eyes of Z@@ ede@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on bound him in f@@ et@@ ters , and carried him to Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
and he burned the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jer@@ usalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pil@@ lars of br@@ ass that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their br@@ ass to Bab@@ yl@@ on .
in the three and tw@@ enti@@ eth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ zar@@ adan the captain of the guard carried away cap@@ tive of the Jews seven hundred for@@ ty @@@ -@@ @ five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
she we@@ ep@@ s bit@@ ter@@ ly in the night , and her te@@ ars are on her che@@ eks ; among all her lov@@ ers she has none to comfor@@ t her : all her friends have dealt t@@ reac@@ her@@ ously with her ; they are become her enem@@ ies .
the ad@@ versary has spread out his hand on all her pleas@@ ant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanc@@ tu@@ ary , concerning whom you comman@@ ded that they should not enter into your assembly .
how has the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cl@@ oud in his an@@ ger ! he has cast down from heav@@ en to the ear@@ th the beauty of Israel , An@@ d has@@ n '@@ t remember@@ ed his foot@@ st@@ ool in the day of his an@@ ger .
the Lord has become as an enemy , he has sw@@ allowed up Israel ; He has sw@@ allowed up all her pal@@ aces , he has destroyed his stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds ; He has multi@@ p@@ lied in the daughter of Ju@@ da@@ h mourning and lament@@ ation .
the el@@ ders of the daughter of Z@@ ion sit on the ground , they keep sil@@ ence ; They have cast up d@@ ust on their heads ; they have clo@@ th@@ ed themselves with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th : the vir@@ g@@ ins of Jer@@ usalem han@@ g down their heads to the ground .
look , Yah@@ we@@ h , and see to whom you have done thus ! shall the women eat their fruit , the children that are d@@ and@@ led in the hands ? shall the pri@@ est and the pro@@ phe@@ t be killed in the sanc@@ tu@@ ary of the Lord ?
the ton@@ gue of the nur@@ sing child cl@@ ings to the ro@@ of of his m@@ outh for thir@@ st : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of So@@ dom , That was over@@ thrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
those who are killed with the s@@ word are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these p@@ ine away , stric@@ ken through , for want of the fru@@ its of the field .
the an@@ ger of Yah@@ we@@ h has sc@@ at@@ tered them ; he will no more regard them : they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t respect the persons of the pri@@ ests , they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t fav@@ or the el@@ ders .
re@@ jo@@ ice and be glad , daughter of E@@ dom , that d@@ well in the land of U@@ z : the c@@ up shall pass through to you also ; you shall be dr@@ un@@ ken , and shall make yo@@ ur@@ self nak@@ ed .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river C@@ he@@ bar , that the heav@@ ens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
out of its mid@@ st came the lik@@ eness of four living cre@@ atures . this was their appearance : they had the lik@@ eness of a man .
their feet were stra@@ ight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's fo@@ ot ; and they spar@@ k@@ led like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass .
wher@@ ever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the whe@@ els were lifted up bes@@ ide them ; for the spirit of the living cre@@ ature was in the whe@@ els .
above the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one , as the appearance of a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone ; and on the lik@@ eness of the th@@ r@@ one was a lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man on it above .
not to many peoples of a st@@ range speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . su@@ rely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
I heard the no@@ ise of the w@@ ings of the living cre@@ atures as they touched one another , and the no@@ ise of the whe@@ els bes@@ ide them , even the no@@ ise of a great rus@@ hing .
so the Spiri@@ t lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bit@@ ter@@ ness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was strong on me .
but you , son of man , be@@ hold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bin@@ d you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
and I will make your ton@@ gue stick to the ro@@ of of your m@@ outh , that you shall be m@@ ute , and shall not be to them a re@@ pro@@ ver ; for they are a rebel@@ li@@ ous house .
and lay siege against it , and build for@@ ts against it , and cast up a mo@@ und against it ; set camps also against it , and plant bat@@ tering r@@ ams against it all around .
for I have appointed the years of their in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity to be to you a number of days , even three hundred n@@ in@@ ety days : so you shall bear the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel .
be@@ hold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
I will do in you that which I have not done , and where@@ un@@ to I will not do any more the like , because of all your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
therefore the fa@@ thers shall eat the sons in the mid@@ st of you , and the sons shall eat their fa@@ thers ; and I will exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you ; and the whole re@@ mn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ at@@ ter to all the winds .
he who is far off shall die of the p@@ esti@@ len@@ ce ; and he who is near shall fall by the s@@ word ; and he who remains and is bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed shall die by the fam@@ ine : thus will I accomp@@ lish my wr@@ ath on them .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ es@@ ty ; but they made the images of their ab@@ omin@@ ations and their de@@ te@@ stable things there@@ in : therefore have I made it to them as an un@@ clean thing .
therefore I will bring the worst of the nations , and they shall poss@@ ess their houses : I will also make the pride of the strong to ce@@ ase ; and their hol@@ y places shall be prof@@ an@@ ed .
then I looked , and see , in the exp@@ ans@@ e that was over the head of the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m there appeared above them as it were a sap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a th@@ r@@ one .
the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h moun@@ ted up from the ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cl@@ oud , and the court was full of the bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness of Yah@@ we@@ h 's gl@@ ory .
I looked , and be@@ hold , four whe@@ els bes@@ ide the ch@@ er@@ u@@ bi@@ m , one whe@@ el bes@@ ide one ch@@ er@@ u@@ b , and another whe@@ el bes@@ ide another ch@@ er@@ u@@ b ; and the appearance of the whe@@ els was like a ber@@ y@@ l stone .
as for the lik@@ eness of their faces , they were the faces which I saw by the river C@@ he@@ bar , their appe@@ aran@@ ces and themselves ; they went every one stra@@ ight forward .
and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h : for you have not walked in my stat@@ utes , neither have you executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , but have done after the ord@@ inan@@ ces of the nations that are around you .
you have not gone up into the g@@ aps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Yah@@ we@@ h .
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
because with lies you have gri@@ ev@@ ed the heart of the righ@@ te@@ ous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the w@@ ic@@ ked , that he should not return from his w@@ ic@@ ked way , and be sav@@ ed alive :
as for your birth , in the day you were born your nav@@ el was not cut , neither were you was@@ hed in water to cleans@@ e you ; you w@@ eren '@@ t sal@@ ted at all , nor sw@@ add@@ led at all .
you also took your beautiful je@@ wel@@ s of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yo@@ ur@@ self images of men , and played the pro@@ stitute with them ;
that you have sla@@ in my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through [ the fire ] to them ?
you have also committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , your neigh@@ b@@ ors , great of f@@ les@@ h ; and have multi@@ p@@ lied your prostitution , to prov@@ oke me to an@@ ger .
they shall bur@@ n your houses with fire , and exec@@ ute judg@@ ments on you in the sight of many women ; and I will cause you to ce@@ ase from playing the pro@@ stitute , and you shall also give no h@@ ire any more .
your el@@ der sister is Samar@@ ia , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your left hand , she and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters ; and your younger sister , who d@@ wel@@ ls at your right hand , is So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters .
yet have you not walked in their ways , nor done after their ab@@ omin@@ ations ; but , as [ if that were ] a very little [ thing ] , you were more corrupt than they in all your ways .
I will turn again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of Samar@@ ia and her da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and the cap@@ tivity of your cap@@ tives in their mid@@ st ;
that you may bear your own sh@@ ame , and may be as@@ ha@@ med because of all that you have done , in that you are a comfor@@ t to them .
that you may remember , and be con@@ founded , and never open your m@@ outh any more , because of your sh@@ ame , when I have for@@ given you all that you have done , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
and has not e@@ aten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the id@@ ols of the house of Israel , neither has def@@ iled his neigh@@ bor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
and has not wron@@ ged any , but has restored to the deb@@ tor his pledge , has taken nothing by rob@@ bery , has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
neither has wron@@ ged any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by rob@@ bery , but has given his bread to the hun@@ gry , and has covered the nak@@ ed with a gar@@ ment ;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ord@@ inan@@ ces , has walked in my stat@@ utes ; he shall not die for the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall su@@ rely live .
but if the w@@ ic@@ ked turn from all his sin@@ s that he has committed , and keep all my stat@@ utes , and do that which is law@@ ful and right , he shall su@@ rely live , he shall not die .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their p@@ it .
they put him in a c@@ age with ho@@ oks , and brought him to the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on ; they brought him into stron@@ gh@@ ol@@ ds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
in that day I s@@ wor@@ e to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
moreover also I s@@ wor@@ e to them in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flow@@ ing with milk and hon@@ ey , which is the gl@@ ory of all lands ;
I said to their children in the w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , D@@ on '@@ t walk in the stat@@ utes of your fa@@ thers , neither observe their ord@@ inan@@ ces , nor def@@ ile yo@@ ur@@ selves with their id@@ ols .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
and I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries in which you are sc@@ at@@ tered , with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and with an out@@ stret@@ ched arm , and with wr@@ ath p@@ oured out ;
it is given to be fur@@ b@@ ished , that it may be handled : the s@@ word , it is shar@@ pen@@ ed , yes , it is fur@@ b@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the kil@@ ler .
I will p@@ our out my in@@ dign@@ ation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wr@@ ath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , s@@ kil@@ l@@ ful to destroy .
in you have they set light by father and mother ; in the mid@@ st of you have they dealt by op@@ pression with the foreig@@ ner ; in you have they wron@@ ged the fa@@ ther@@ less and the wi@@ dow .
one has committed ab@@ omin@@ ation with his neigh@@ bor 's wife ; and another has le@@ w@@ dly def@@ iled his daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; and another in you has hum@@ b@@ led his sister , his father 's daughter .
be@@ hold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dis@@ honest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the mid@@ st of you .
and they played the pro@@ stitute in Egypt ; they played the pro@@ stitute in their youth ; there were their bre@@ asts pressed , and there was handled the bos@@ om of their vir@@ gin@@ ity .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ gin@@ ity ; and they p@@ oured out their prostitution on her .
for thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : be@@ hold , I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you h@@ ate , into the hand of them from whom your sou@@ l is ali@@ en@@ ated ;
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gn@@ a@@ w the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your bre@@ asts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dis@@ pat@@ ch them with their s@@ words ; they shall kill their sons and their da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters , and bur@@ n up their houses with fire .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
then set it empty on its co@@ als , that it may be hot , and its br@@ ass may bur@@ n , and that its fil@@ th@@ iness may be m@@ ol@@ ten in it , that its rust may be consu@@ med .
she has we@@ ar@@ ied [ her@@ self ] with to@@ il ; yet her great rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go forth out of her ; her rust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t [ go forth ] by fire .
in your fil@@ th@@ iness is le@@ w@@ d@@ ness : because I have cleans@@ ed you and you w@@ eren '@@ t cleans@@ ed , you shall not be cleans@@ ed from your fil@@ th@@ iness any more , until I have caused my wr@@ ath toward you to rest .
therefore , be@@ hold , I will open the side of Mo@@ a@@ b from the cities , from his cities which are on his fron@@ ti@@ ers , the gl@@ ory of the country , Beth J@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al Me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
she shall be a place for the spreading of n@@ ets in the mid@@ st of the sea ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h ; and she shall become a sp@@ oil to the nations .
with the ho@@ of@@ s of his hor@@ ses shall he tre@@ ad down all your streets ; he shall kill your people with the s@@ word ; and the pil@@ lars of your strength shall go down to the ground .
Arabia , and all the pr@@ inces of K@@ ed@@ ar , they were the mer@@ chan@@ ts of your hand ; in lam@@ bs , and r@@ ams , and go@@ ats , in these were they your mer@@ chan@@ ts .
all who handled the o@@ ar , the mar@@ in@@ ers , [ and ] all the pil@@ ots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand on the land ,
and shall cause their voice to be heard over you , and shall cry bit@@ ter@@ ly , and shall cast up d@@ ust on their heads , they shall w@@ allow themselves in the ashes :
therefore , be@@ hold , I will bring st@@ ran@@ gers on you , the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wis@@ dom , and they shall def@@ ile your bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ness .
they shall bring you down to the p@@ it ; and you shall die the death of those who are sla@@ in , in the heart of the seas .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and t@@ ore all their sho@@ ul@@ ders ; and when they le@@ an@@ ed on you , you broke , and paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed all of their th@@ igh@@ s . "
and I will bring back the cap@@ tivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of P@@ ath@@ ros , into the land of their birth ; and they shall be there a base k@@ ing@@ dom .
it shall be the base of the k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms ; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations : and I will dimin@@ ish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
it came to pass in the seven and tw@@ enti@@ eth year , in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
in that day will I cause a Hor@@ n to bu@@ d forth to the house of Israel , and I will give you the opening of the m@@ outh in their mid@@ st ; and they shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
in that day shall mes@@ sen@@ gers go forth from before me in ships to make the car@@ ele@@ ss Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians afraid ; and there shall be an@@ gu@@ ish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , be@@ hold , it comes .
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Bab@@ yl@@ on , and put my s@@ word in his hand : but I will break the arms of P@@ har@@ a@@ o@@ h , and he shall gro@@ an before him with the gro@@ an@@ ings of a deadly wounded man .
therefore its stat@@ ure was ex@@ al@@ ted above all the trees of the field ; and its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were multi@@ p@@ lied , and its branches became long by reason of many waters , when it shot [ them ] forth .
all the birds of the sky made their nes@@ ts in its b@@ ou@@ gh@@ s ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
I will even deliver him into the hand of the m@@ igh@@ ty one of the nations ; he shall su@@ rely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess .
they also went down into She@@ ol with him to those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word ; yes , those who were his arm , [ that ] lived under his shadow in the mid@@ st of the nations .
it happened in the twel@@ f@@ th year , in the twel@@ f@@ th month , in the first [ day ] of the month , that the word of Yah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
when I shall ex@@ tin@@ gu@@ ish you , I will cover the heav@@ ens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cl@@ oud , and the moon shall not give its light .
by the s@@ words of the m@@ igh@@ ty will I cause your multi@@ tude to fall ; the ter@@ ri@@ ble of the nations are they all : and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt , and all its multi@@ tude shall be destroyed .
when I shall make the land of Egypt de@@ so@@ late and waste , a land de@@ stitute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who d@@ well there@@ in , then shall they know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , wa@@ il for the multi@@ tude of Egypt , and cast them down , even her , and the da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters of the famous nations , to the lower parts of the ear@@ th , with those who go down into the p@@ it .
whose graves are set in the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the p@@ it , and her company is around her grave ; all of them sla@@ in , fallen by the s@@ word , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings and all her pr@@ inces , who in their might are laid with those who are sla@@ in by the s@@ word : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with those who go down to the p@@ it .
nevertheless , if you warn the w@@ ic@@ ked of his way to turn from it , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his way ; he shall die in his in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , but you have delivered your sou@@ l .
I will make the land a de@@ so@@ lation and an ast@@ on@@ is@@ hment ; and the pride of her power shall ce@@ ase ; and the mountains of Israel shall be de@@ so@@ late , so that none shall pass through .
they were sc@@ at@@ tered , because there was no she@@ ph@@ er@@ d ; and they became food to all the animals of the field , and were sc@@ at@@ tered .
as for my she@@ ep , they eat that which you have tro@@ dden with your feet , and they drink that which you have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
I will make them and the places around my hill a b@@ les@@ sing ; and I will cause the sho@@ wer to come down in its season ; there shall be sho@@ wers of b@@ les@@ sing .
they shall no more be a pre@@ y to the nations , neither shall the animals of the ear@@ th dev@@ our them ; but they shall d@@ well sec@@ u@@ rely , and none shall make them afraid .
I will raise up to them a plan@@ tation for ren@@ own , and they shall be no more consu@@ med with fam@@ ine in the land , neither bear the sh@@ ame of the nations any more .
because you have had a perpet@@ ual en@@ mity , and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the s@@ word in the time of their cal@@ am@@ ity , in the time of the in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity of the end ;
neither will I let you hear any more the sh@@ ame of the nations , neither shall you bear the re@@ pro@@ ach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to st@@ um@@ ble any more , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h .
I will sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your fil@@ th@@ iness , and from all your id@@ ols , will I cleans@@ e you .
I will also give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the st@@ ony heart out of your f@@ les@@ h , and I will give you a heart of f@@ les@@ h .
then you shall remember your ev@@ il ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yo@@ ur@@ selves in your own sight for your in@@ i@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ omin@@ ations .
the hand of Yah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me out in the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and set me down in the mid@@ st of the val@@ ley ; and it was full of b@@ ones .
you shall know that I am Yah@@ we@@ h , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
it shall happen in that day , when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , that my wr@@ ath shall come up into my nos@@ tr@@ ils .
and I will turn you around , and will lead you on , and will cause you to come up from the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the north ; and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel ;
those who pass through the land shall pass through ; and when any sees a man 's bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , until the under@@ tak@@ ers have buried it in the val@@ ley of Ham@@ on Go@@ g .
he brought me there ; and , be@@ hold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of br@@ ass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring Re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he meas@@ ured the threshold of the gate , one Re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold , one Re@@ ed broad .
and a border before the lo@@ dges , one cu@@ bit [ on this side ] , and a border , one cu@@ bit on that side ; and the lo@@ dges , six cu@@ bi@@ ts on this side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts on that side .
[ from ] the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the gate at the entrance to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner por@@ ch of the gate were fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts .
then he meas@@ ured the b@@ read@@ th from the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the lower gate to the fo@@ ref@@ ront of the in@@ ner court outside , one hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts , [ both ] on the east and on the north .
the lo@@ dges of it were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its ar@@ ches were after the measure of the first gate : its length was fif@@ ty cu@@ bi@@ ts , and the b@@ read@@ th twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cu@@ bi@@ ts .
the ar@@ ches of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the ou@@ ter court ; and pal@@ m trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the as@@ cent to it had eight steps .
he brought me to the temp@@ le , and meas@@ ured the posts , six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the one side , and six cu@@ bi@@ ts broad on the other side , which was the b@@ read@@ th of the tent .
the doors of the side rooms were toward [ the place ] that was left , one door toward the north , and another door toward the south : and the b@@ read@@ th of the place that was left was five cu@@ bi@@ ts all around .
as for the temp@@ le , the door posts were s@@ quar@@ ed ; and as for the face of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , the appearance [ of it ] was as the appearance [ of the temp@@ le ] .
the doors had two leaves [ ap@@ i@@ ece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were closed windows and pal@@ m trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the th@@ res@@ holds .
then he brought me forth into the ou@@ ter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place , and which was over against the building toward the north .
now when he had made an end of measuring the in@@ ner house , he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and meas@@ ured it all around .
be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the ear@@ th sh@@ ined with his gl@@ ory .
you shall give to the pri@@ ests the L@@ evi@@ tes who are of the se@@ ed of Zad@@ ok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , a young bul@@ l for a sin offering .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and be@@ hold , the gl@@ ory of Yah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Yah@@ we@@ h : and I fell on my face .
thus says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bul@@ l without ble@@ mis@@ h ; and you shall cleans@@ e the sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
so you shall do on the seventh [ day ] of the month for everyone who err@@ s , and for him who is simple : so you shall make At@@ on@@ ement for the house .
when the pr@@ ince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and he shall go forth by its way .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the hol@@ y rooms for the pri@@ ests , which looked toward the north : and be@@ hold , there was a place on the hin@@ der part w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard .
now when I had returned , be@@ hold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
by the border of G@@ ad , at the south side sou@@ th@@ ward , the border shall be even from Tam@@ ar to the waters of Mer@@ ib@@ ath K@@ ade@@ sh , to the Bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea .
at the east side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , and three gates : even the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one ; the gate of Ze@@ bul@@ un , one .
at the west side four thousand and five hundred [ re@@ eds ] , with their three gates : the gate of G@@ ad , one ; the gate of As@@ her , one ; the gate of Nap@@ h@@ tal@@ i , one .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties , and of the wine which he d@@ rank , and that they should be no@@ ur@@ ished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the you@@ ths who eat of the king 's da@@ in@@ ties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
then the king comman@@ ded to call the mag@@ ic@@ ians , and the en@@ chan@@ ters , and the sor@@ cer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , to tell the king his dre@@ ams . so they came in and stood before the king .
but there is a God in heav@@ en who reve@@ als secre@@ ts , and he has made known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its bre@@ ast and its arms of silver , its bel@@ ly and its th@@ igh@@ s of br@@ ass ,
and wher@@ ever the children of men d@@ well , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
then these men were bound in their p@@ ants , their tun@@ ics , and their man@@ t@@ les , and their [ other ] gar@@ ments , and were cast into the mid@@ st of the burning fi@@ ery fur@@ n@@ ace .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Bab@@ yl@@ on before me , that they might make known to me the interpre@@ tation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ ic@@ ians , the en@@ chan@@ ters , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the so@@ o@@ th@@ say@@ ers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpre@@ tation .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and be@@ hold , a tree in the mid@@ st of the ear@@ th ; and its he@@ ight was great .
while the word was in the king 's m@@ outh , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ nez@@ z@@ ar , to you it is spoken : the k@@ ing@@ dom has depar@@ ted from you :
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temp@@ le of God 's house which was at Jer@@ usalem ; and the king and his lor@@ ds , his wi@@ ves and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , d@@ rank from them .
in the same hour came forth the fin@@ gers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the lam@@ p@@ stand on the plas@@ ter of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his th@@ ou@@ ghts troubled him ; and the join@@ ts of his th@@ igh@@ s were lo@@ os@@ ened , and his k@@ ne@@ es struck one against another .
then comman@@ ded Bel@@ s@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , and they clo@@ th@@ ed Daniel with pur@@ ple , and put a chain of gold about his nec@@ k , and made proc@@ lamation concerning him , that he should be the third ru@@ ler in the k@@ ing@@ dom .
then the king , when he heard these words , was very disp@@ le@@ ased , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him ; and he la@@ bo@@ red until the going down of the sun to rescue him .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fas@@ ting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sle@@ ep fled from him .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the Hor@@ n spoke ; I saw even until the animal was sla@@ in , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
I saw in the night visions , and be@@ hold , there came with the cl@@ ou@@ ds of the sky one like a son of man , and he came even to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
as for the ten hor@@ ns , out of this k@@ ing@@ dom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be di@@ verse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
as I was considering , be@@ hold , a male go@@ at came from the west over the sur@@ face of the whole ear@@ th , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t touch the ground : and the go@@ at had a no@@ table Hor@@ n between his eyes .
he came to the ram that had the two hor@@ ns , which I saw standing before the river , and ran on him in the fur@@ y of his power .
yes , it mag@@ ni@@ fied itself , even to the pr@@ ince of the army ; and it took away from him the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and the place of his sanc@@ tu@@ ary was cast down .
the army was given over [ to it ] together with the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] through dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence ; and it cast down truth to the ground , and it did [ its pleas@@ ure ] and prosp@@ ered .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and be@@ hold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
his power shall be m@@ igh@@ ty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy won@@ der@@ fully , and shall prosp@@ er and do [ his pleas@@ ure ] ; and he shall destroy the m@@ igh@@ ty ones and the hol@@ y people .
neither have we list@@ ened to your servants the pro@@ ph@@ ets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our pr@@ inces , and our fa@@ thers , and to all the people of the land .
therefore has Yah@@ we@@ h watched over the ev@@ il , and brought it on us ; for Yah@@ we@@ h our God is righ@@ te@@ ous in all his works which he does , and we have not obe@@ yed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a m@@ igh@@ ty hand , and have gotten yo@@ ur@@ self ren@@ own , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ic@@ k@@ edly .
yes , while I was speaking in pray@@ er , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swi@@ f@@ tly , touched me about the time of the evening offering .
I , Daniel , alone saw the vision ; for the men who were with me di@@ d@@ n '@@ t see the vision ; but a great qu@@ ak@@ ing fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
so I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; for my co@@ me@@ lin@@ ess was turned in me into corruption , and I re@@ tained no strength .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sle@@ ep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the pr@@ ince of the k@@ ing@@ dom of Per@@ sia with@@ stood me twenty @@@ -@@ @ one days ; but , be@@ hold , Michael , one of the chief pr@@ inces , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Per@@ sia .
for how can the ser@@ vant of this my lor@@ d talk with this my lor@@ d ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there bre@@ ath left in me .
the king of the south shall be strong , and [ one ] of his pr@@ inces ; and he shall be strong above him , and have domin@@ ion ; his domin@@ ion shall be a great domin@@ ion .
after this shall he turn his face to the islands , and shall take many : but a pr@@ ince shall cause the re@@ pro@@ ach offered by him to ce@@ ase ; yes , moreover , he shall cause his re@@ pro@@ ach to turn on him .
in his place shall stand up a con@@ temp@@ ti@@ ble person , to whom they had not given the hon@@ or of the k@@ ing@@ dom : but he shall come in time of security , and shall obtain the k@@ ing@@ dom by f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ies .
then shall he return into his land with great sub@@ stance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the hol@@ y C@@ ov@@ en@@ ant ; and he shall do [ his pleas@@ ure ] , and return to his own land .
forces shall stand on his part , and they shall prof@@ ane the sanc@@ tu@@ ary , even the fortress , and shall take away the contin@@ ual [ bur@@ n@@ t offering ] , and they shall set up the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late .
he shall enter also into the g@@ lor@@ ious land , and many [ countries ] shall be over@@ thrown ; but these shall be delivered out of his hand : E@@ dom , and Mo@@ a@@ b , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the pre@@ ci@@ ous things of Egypt ; and the Lib@@ y@@ ans and the Eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians shall be at his steps .
then I , Daniel , looked , and be@@ hold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
from the time that the contin@@ ual bur@@ n@@ t offering shall be taken away , and the ab@@ omin@@ ation that makes de@@ so@@ late set up , there shall be one thousand two hundred n@@ in@@ ety days .
L@@ est I stri@@ p her nak@@ ed , and make her b@@ are as in the day that she was born , and make her like a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness , and set her like a d@@ ry land , and kill her with thir@@ st .
therefore the land will mour@@ n , and everyone who d@@ wel@@ ls there@@ in will waste aw@@ ay@@ . all living things in her , even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky ; yes , the fish of the sea also die .
let us acknowledge Yah@@ we@@ h . let us press on to know Yah@@ we@@ h . as su@@ rely as the sun rises , Yah@@ we@@ h will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the ear@@ th . "
S@@ tran@@ gers have dev@@ oured his strength , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it . indeed , gra@@ y ha@@ ir@@ s are here and there on him , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t real@@ ize it .
for they so@@ w the wind , and they will re@@ ap the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind . he has no standing gra@@ in . the stal@@ k will yield no head . if it does yield , st@@ ran@@ gers will sw@@ allow it up .
" all their w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess is in G@@ ilg@@ al ; for there I ha@@ ted them . because of the w@@ ic@@ k@@ edn@@ ess of their de@@ eds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their pr@@ inces are rebels .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with ties of love ; and I was to them like those who lift up the yok@@ e on their nec@@ ks ; and I b@@ ent down to him and I f@@ ed him .
I will not exec@@ ute the fi@@ er@@ cen@@ ess of my an@@ ger . I will not return to destroy E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : for I am God , and not man ; the Holy One in the mid@@ st of you ; and I will not come in wr@@ ath .
they will come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Yah@@ we@@ h .
therefore they will be like the morning mist , and like the dew that passes away early , like the c@@ haf@@ f that is driven with the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind out of the th@@ res@@ hing floor , and like the smoke out of the ch@@ im@@ ney .
the sor@@ ro@@ ws of a trav@@ ailing woman will come on him . he is an un@@ wise son ; for when it is time , he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come to the opening of the w@@ om@@ b .
a fire dev@@ ours before them , and behind them , a fla@@ me bur@@ ns . the land is as the gar@@ den of E@@ den before them , and behind them , a de@@ so@@ late w@@ il@@ der@@ ness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
Yah@@ we@@ h th@@ unders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obe@@ ys his command ; for the day of Yah@@ we@@ h is great and very aw@@ es@@ ome , and who can en@@ dur@@ e it ?
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Yah@@ we@@ h , your God , who has dealt won@@ dro@@ us@@ ly with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
and have sold the children of Ju@@ da@@ h and the children of Jer@@ usalem to the sons of the Greeks , that you may remove them far from their border .
and I will sell your sons and your da@@ ug@@ h@@ ters into the hands of the children of Ju@@ da@@ h , and they will sell them to the men of She@@ ba , to a far@@ away nation , for Yah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
but I will kin@@ dle a fire in the wall of R@@ ab@@ bah , and it will dev@@ our its pal@@ aces , with sh@@ ou@@ ting in the day of battle , with a storm in the day of the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind ;
neither shall he stand who hand@@ les the bo@@ w ; and he who is swift of fo@@ ot won '@@ t escape ; neither shall he who ri@@ des the hor@@ se deliver himself ;
can a bird fall in a tra@@ p on the ear@@ th , where no sn@@ are is set for him ? does a sn@@ are spring up from the ground , when there is nothing to catch ?
" for in the day that I visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel on him , I will also visit the al@@ tar@@ s of Be@@ the@@ l ; and the hor@@ ns of the alt@@ ar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
Wo@@ e to those who are at ease in Z@@ ion , and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samar@@ ia , the no@@ table men of the chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel come !
who lie on beds of Iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves on their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the mid@@ st of the stall ;
thus the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h showed me : and be@@ hold , he formed loc@@ ust@@ s in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and be@@ hold , it was the latter growth after the king 's har@@ v@@ est .
it will happen in that day , " says the Lord Yah@@ we@@ h , " that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will dar@@ ken the ear@@ th in the clear day .
they will w@@ ander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east ; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yah@@ we@@ h , and will not find it .
" for , be@@ hold , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all the nations , as gra@@ in is si@@ f@@ ted in a si@@ eve , yet not the least ker@@ nel will fall on the ear@@ th .
in that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen , and close up its breaches , and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old ;
but don '@@ t look down on your brother in the day of his disaster , and don '@@ t re@@ jo@@ ice over the children of Ju@@ da@@ h in the day of their destruction . D@@ on '@@ t speak pro@@ u@@ dly in the day of dist@@ ress .
D@@ on '@@ t enter into the gate of my people in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity . D@@ on '@@ t look down on their aff@@ li@@ ction in the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity , neither se@@ ize their wealth on the day of their cal@@ am@@ ity .
the news reached the king of N@@ inev@@ e@@ h , and he ar@@ ose from his th@@ r@@ one , and took off his royal ro@@ be , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , and sat in ashes .
but let them be covered with s@@ ack@@ clo@@ th , both man and animal , and let them cry m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his ev@@ il way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
then Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a bo@@ o@@ th , and sat under it in the sha@@ de , until he might see what would become of the city .
Yah@@ we@@ h God prepared a v@@ ine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a sha@@ de over his head , to deliver him from his dis@@ comfor@@ t . so Jon@@ ah was exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad because of the v@@ ine .
who also eat the f@@ les@@ h of my people , and fla@@ y their s@@ kin from off them , and break their b@@ ones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the po@@ t , and as f@@ les@@ h within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then they will cry to Yah@@ we@@ h , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their de@@ eds ev@@ il . "
" therefore night is over you , with no vision , and it is dark to you , that you may not div@@ ine ; and the sun will go down on the pro@@ ph@@ ets , and the day will be black over them .
but as for me , I am full of power by the Spiri@@ t of Yah@@ we@@ h , and of judgment , and of might , to declare to Jac@@ o@@ b his dis@@ obe@@ di@@ ence , and to Israel his sin .
but in the latter days , it will happen that the mountain of Yah@@ we@@ h 's temp@@ le will be established on the top of the mountains , and it will be ex@@ al@@ ted above the hil@@ ls ; and peoples will stream to it .
he shall stand , and shall she@@ ph@@ er@@ d in the strength of Yah@@ we@@ h , in the maj@@ es@@ ty of the name of Yah@@ we@@ h his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the ear@@ th .
they will rule the land of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a with the s@@ word , and the land of N@@ im@@ ro@@ d in its gates . he will deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an , when he inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches within our border .
D@@ on '@@ t trust in a neigh@@ bor . D@@ on '@@ t put confidence in a friend . with the woman lying in your em@@ br@@ ace , be careful of the words of your m@@ outh !
for the son dis@@ hon@@ ors the father , the daughter rises up against her mother , the daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law ; a man 's enem@@ ies are the men of his own house .
I will bear the in@@ dign@@ ation of Yah@@ we@@ h , because I have sin@@ ned against him , until he p@@ leads my case , and execu@@ tes judgment for me . he will bring me forth to the light . I will see his righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness .
they will lick the d@@ ust like a ser@@ p@@ ent . like cra@@ w@@ ling things of the ear@@ th they shall come tre@@ m@@ b@@ ling out of their den@@ s . they will come with fear to Yah@@ we@@ h our God , and will be afraid because of you .
Yah@@ we@@ h is slow to an@@ ger , and great in power , and will by no means leave the guilty un@@ punished . Yah@@ we@@ h has his way in the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind and in the storm , and the cl@@ ou@@ ds are the d@@ ust of his feet .

the strong went out , and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the ear@@ th : and he said , " G@@ o around and through the ear@@ th ! " so they walked back and forth through the ear@@ th .

Yah@@ we@@ h their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for they are like the je@@ wel@@ s of a cro@@ wn , lifted on high over his land .
they shall be as m@@ igh@@ ty men , t@@ reading down mu@@ d@@ dy streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , because Yah@@ we@@ h is with them ; and the ri@@ ders on hor@@ ses will be con@@ founded .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ri@@ a ; and I will bring them into the land of G@@ il@@ e@@ ad and Lebanon ; and there won '@@ t be room enough for them .

it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jer@@ usalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Yah@@ we@@ h will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neigh@@ bor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neigh@@ bor .
so will be the pla@@ gue of the hor@@ se , of the mul@@ e , of the C@@ ame@@ l , and of the don@@ key , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that pla@@ gue .

they , having heard the king , went their way ; and be@@ hold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .

" be careful that you don '@@ t do your char@@ itable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your F@@ ather who is in heav@@ en .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
for I came to set a man at odds against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law against her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
who@@ ever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be for@@ given him ; but who@@ ever speaks against the Holy Spiri@@ t , it will not be for@@ given him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .

" for the Kingdom of He@@ av@@ en is like a man who was the master of a household , who went out early in the morning to h@@ ire labor@@ ers for his v@@ ine@@ yard .

because he had been often bound with f@@ et@@ ters and cha@@ ins , and the cha@@ ins had been torn apart by him , and the f@@ et@@ ters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to t@@ ame him .
they came to J@@ es@@ us , and saw him who had been poss@@ essed by dem@@ ons sitting , clo@@ th@@ ed , and in his right mind , even him who had the Legi@@ on ; and they were afraid .

they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the bro@@ w of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the c@@ lif@@ f .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any si@@ ck with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and he@@ aled them .

it happened , that when he had sat down at the table with them , he took the bread and gave thanks . breaking it , he gave to them .
he made a w@@ hip of cor@@ ds , and threw all out of the temp@@ le , both the she@@ ep and the ox@@ en ; and he p@@ oured out the chan@@ gers ' money , and over@@ threw their tables .
he who believes in him is not jud@@ ged . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe has been jud@@ ged already , because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .

little children , I will be with you a little while longer . you will seek me , and as I said to the Jews , ' W@@ here I am going , you can '@@ t come , ' so now I tell you .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my F@@ ather .

but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I di@@ d@@ n '@@ t tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .

now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of co@@ als , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
when P@@ il@@ ate therefore heard these words , he brought J@@ es@@ us out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pav@@ ement , " but in H@@ eb@@ re@@ w , " G@@ ab@@ b@@ ath@@ a . "
but the other dis@@ cip@@ les came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cu@@ bi@@ ts away ) , dra@@ gging the net full of fish .
there are also many other things which J@@ es@@ us did , which if they would all be written , I sup@@ pose that even the world itself wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have room for the books that would be written .
they recogn@@ ized him , that it was he who used to sit beg@@ ging for gifts for the ne@@ edy at the Be@@ autiful G@@ ate of the temp@@ le . they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at what had happened to him .
when they had pray@@ ed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spiri@@ t , and they spoke the word of God with bol@@ d@@ ness .
they agreed with him . summon@@ ing the A@@ post@@ les , they beat them and comman@@ ded them not to speak in the name of J@@ es@@ us , and let them go .

for un@@ clean spir@@ its came out of many of those who had them . they came out , cr@@ ying with a l@@ oud voice . many who had been paral@@ y@@ z@@ ed and la@@ me were he@@ aled .
now while Peter was very per@@ p@@ lex@@ ed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , be@@ hold , the men who were sent by Cor@@ neli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
for so has the Lord comman@@ ded us , saying , ' I have set you as a light for the Gen@@ ti@@ les , that you should bring sal@@ vation to the ut@@ ter@@ most parts of the ear@@ th . ' "
but Paul di@@ d@@ n '@@ t think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in P@@ amp@@ hy@@ li@@ a , and di@@ d@@ n '@@ t go with them to do the work .
as they went on their way through the cities , they delivered the decre@@ es to them to keep which had been or@@ da@@ ined by the A@@ post@@ les and el@@ ders who were at Jer@@ usalem .
on the Sab@@ b@@ ath day we went forth outside of the city by a ri@@ versi@@ de , where we supposed there was a place of pray@@ er , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
for as I passed along , and observed the objects of your worship , I found also an alt@@ ar with this ins@@ cri@@ ption : ' to an unknown God . ' what therefore you worship in ignor@@ ance , this I announce to you .
he made from one blood every nation of men to d@@ well on all the sur@@ face of the ear@@ th , having determined appointed se@@ as@@ ons , and the boundaries of their d@@ wel@@ lings ,
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness by the man whom he has or@@ da@@ ined ; of which he has given assur@@ ance to all men , in that he has raised him from the dead . "
but taking his leave of them , and saying , " I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jer@@ usalem , but I will return again to you if God Wil@@ ls , " he set sa@@ il from E@@ ph@@ es@@ us .
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we wo@@ ul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be able to give an account of this commo@@ tion . "
a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us sat in the window , weighed down with deep sle@@ ep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sle@@ ep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
for Paul had determined to sa@@ il past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was has@@ tening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jer@@ usalem on the day of Pen@@ tec@@ ost .
when it happened that we had par@@ ted from them and had set sa@@ il , we came with a stra@@ ight course to C@@ os , and the next day to R@@ ho@@ des , and from there to Pat@@ ara .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's compan@@ ions , depar@@ ted , and came to Ca@@ es@@ area . we entered into the house of Philip the Evangel@@ ist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they di@@ d@@ n '@@ t understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
when a great argument ar@@ ose , the comman@@ ding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , comman@@ ded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the barracks .
this I also did in Jer@@ usalem . I both shut up many of the sa@@ ints in prisons , having received authority from the chief pri@@ ests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
embar@@ king in a ship of Ad@@ ram@@ y@@ tti@@ um , which was about to sa@@ il to places on the coast of Asia , we put to sea ; Ar@@ ist@@ arch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thessalon@@ ica , being with us .
after they had ho@@ isted it up , they used cab@@ les to help reinforce the ship . fearing that they would run ag@@ round on the Sy@@ r@@ tis s@@ and bars , they lowered the sea an@@ ch@@ or , and so were driven along .
but when the fo@@ ur@@ teen@@ th night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sa@@ il@@ ors sur@@ mis@@ ed that they were drawing near to some land .
casting off the an@@ ch@@ ors , they left them in the sea , at the same time un@@ t@@ ying the ru@@ d@@ der ro@@ pes . Ho@@ isting up the fore@@ sa@@ il to the wind , they made for the beach .
from there the brothers , when they heard of us , came to meet us as far as The Market of Ap@@ pi@@ us and The Th@@ ree ta@@ ver@@ ns . when Paul saw them , he thanked God , and took courage .
when we entered into Rome , the centur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guar@@ ded him .
for I am not as@@ ha@@ med of the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist , for it is the power of God for sal@@ vation for everyone who believes ; for the J@@ ew first , and also for the Greek .
for the in@@ visible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen , being perceived through the things that are made , even his ever@@ lasting power and di@@ vin@@ ity ; that they may be without exc@@ use .
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every m@@ outh may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
without being weak@@ ened in faith , he di@@ d@@ n '@@ t consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ ah 's w@@ om@@ b .
kno@@ wing this , that our old man was cru@@ ci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bon@@ da@@ ge to sin .
or don '@@ t you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has domin@@ ion over a man for as long as he lives ?
for I know that in me , that is , in my f@@ les@@ h , d@@ wel@@ ls no good thing . for desire is present with me , but I don '@@ t find it doing that which is good .
there is therefore now no condem@@ nation to those who are in Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , who don '@@ t walk according to the f@@ les@@ h , but according to the Spiri@@ t .
for those who live according to the f@@ les@@ h set their min@@ ds on the things of the f@@ les@@ h , but those who live according to the Spiri@@ t , the things of the Spiri@@ t .
but you are not in the f@@ les@@ h but in the Spiri@@ t , if it is so that the Spiri@@ t of God d@@ wel@@ ls in you . but if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the Spiri@@ t of Ch@@ r@@ ist , he is not his .
but if the Spiri@@ t of him who raised up J@@ es@@ us from the dead d@@ wel@@ ls in you , he who raised up Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us from the dead will also give life to your mort@@ al bodies through his Spiri@@ t who d@@ wel@@ ls in you .
for if you live after the f@@ les@@ h , you must die ; but if by the Spiri@@ t you put to death the de@@ eds of the body , you will live .
as he says also in Hos@@ ea , " I will call them ' my people , ' which were not my people ; and her ' bel@@ ov@@ ed , ' who was not bel@@ ov@@ ed . "
and how will they pre@@ ach unless they are sent ? as it is written : " how beautiful are the feet of those who pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News of peace , who bring glad ti@@ dings of good things ! "
and if by grace , then it is no longer of works ; otherwise grace is no longer grace . but if it is of works , it is no longer grace ; otherwise work is no longer work .
be of the same mind one toward another . D@@ on '@@ t set your mind on high things , but associate with the hum@@ ble . D@@ on '@@ t be wise in your own conce@@ its .
therefore " If your enemy is hun@@ gry , fe@@ ed him . if he is thir@@ st@@ y , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will he@@ ap co@@ als of fire on his head . "
for it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Ch@@ lo@@ e 's household , that there are conten@@ tions among you .
for seeing that in the wis@@ dom of God , the world through its wis@@ dom di@@ d@@ n '@@ t know God , it was God 's good pleas@@ ure through the fo@@ ol@@ ishness of the pre@@ aching to save those who believe .
but God chose the fo@@ ol@@ ish things of the world that he might put to sh@@ ame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world , that he might put to sh@@ ame the things that are strong ;
and God chose the low@@ ly things of the world , and the things that are desp@@ ised , and the things that are not , that he might bring to nothing the things that are :
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spiri@@ t .
but we received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spiri@@ t which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be jud@@ ged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you di@@ d@@ n '@@ t receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you bo@@ ast as if you had not received it ?
such were some of you , but you were was@@ hed . but you were sanc@@ ti@@ fied . but you were justified in the name of the Lord J@@ es@@ us , and in the Spiri@@ t of our God .
D@@ on '@@ t you know that your bodies are members of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? shall I then take the members of Ch@@ r@@ ist , and make them members of a pro@@ stitute ? May it never be !
( but if she de@@ parts , let her remain un@@ married , or else be reconc@@ iled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
I think that it is good therefore , because of the dist@@ ress that is on us , that it is good for a man to be as he is .
but food will not commen@@ d us to God . for neither , if we don '@@ t eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a v@@ ine@@ yard , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat of its fruit ? or who fe@@ eds a flock , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t drink from the flock 's milk ?
D@@ on '@@ t you know that those who serve around sac@@ red things eat from the things of the temp@@ le , and those who wait on the alt@@ ar have their portion with the alt@@ ar ?
what then is my reward ? that , when I pre@@ ach the Go@@ od News , I may present the Go@@ od News of Ch@@ r@@ ist without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Go@@ od News .
the c@@ up of b@@ les@@ sing which we b@@ less , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the blood of Ch@@ r@@ ist ? the bread which we break , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the body of Ch@@ r@@ ist ?
you can '@@ t both drink the c@@ up of the Lord and the c@@ up of dem@@ ons . you can '@@ t both par@@ take of the table of the Lord , and of the table of dem@@ ons .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and gl@@ ory of God , but the woman is the gl@@ ory of the man .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away ch@@ il@@ dish things .
what is it then ? I will pra@@ y with the spirit , and I will pra@@ y with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
if any man thinks himself to be a pro@@ phe@@ t , or spir@@ itual , let him recogn@@ ize the things which I write to you , that they are the comman@@ d@@ ment of the Lord .
Paul , an A@@ pos@@ tle of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us through the will of God , and Tim@@ o@@ thy our brother , to the assembly of God which is at Cor@@ inth , with all the sa@@ ints who are in the whole of A@@ cha@@ ia :

being revealed that you are a letter of Ch@@ r@@ ist , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spiri@@ t of the living God ; not in tab@@ lets of stone , but in tab@@ lets that are hear@@ ts of f@@ les@@ h .

while we don '@@ t look at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . for the things which are seen are tempor@@ al , but the things which are not seen are eter@@ nal .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Ch@@ r@@ ist ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
for he says , " At an acceptable time I list@@ ened to you , in a day of sal@@ vation I helped you . " be@@ hold , now is the acceptable time . be@@ hold , now is the day of sal@@ vation .
but I have sent the brothers that our bo@@ asting on your behalf may not be in v@@ ain in this respect , that , just as I said , you may be prepared ,
for though I should bo@@ ast somewhat ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly concerning our authority , ( which the Lord gave for building you up , and not for casting you down ) I will not be disappointed ,
but what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion , that in which they bo@@ ast , they may be found even as we .
for you bear with a man , if he brings you into bon@@ da@@ ge , if he dev@@ ours you , if he takes you cap@@ tive , if he ex@@ al@@ ts himself , if he strikes you on the face .
for what is there in which you were made in@@ fer@@ ior to the rest of the assemb@@ lies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? for@@ give me this wrong .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don '@@ t you know as to your own selves , that J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist is in you ? -@@ -@@ unless indeed you are dis@@ qualified .
but I make known to you , brothers , concerning the Go@@ od News which was pre@@ ached by me , that it is not according to man .
so then , as we have opportunity , let 's do what is good toward all men , and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith .
to an administration of the ful@@ l@@ ness of the times , to sum up all things in Ch@@ r@@ ist , the things in the heav@@ ens , and the things on the ear@@ th , in him ;
in whom you also , having heard the word of the truth , the Go@@ od News of your sal@@ v@@ ation@@ -@@ -@@ in whom , having also believed , you were sealed with the Holy Spiri@@ t of promise ,
that you were at that time separate from Ch@@ r@@ ist , ali@@ en@@ ated from the com@@ mon@@ wealth of Israel , and st@@ ran@@ gers from the c@@ ov@@ en@@ ants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
of which I was made a ser@@ vant , according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power .
being dar@@ ken@@ ed in their understanding , ali@@ en@@ ated from the life of God , because of the ignor@@ ance that is in them , because of the har@@ den@@ ing of their hear@@ ts ;
but if I live on in the f@@ les@@ h , this will bring fruit from my work ; yet I don '@@ t know what I will choose .
who will change the body of our hum@@ iliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his gl@@ ory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
now I re@@ jo@@ ice in my suffer@@ ings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the aff@@ lic@@ tions of Ch@@ r@@ ist in my f@@ les@@ h for his body 's sake , which is the assembly ;
in whom you were also circum@@ c@@ ised with a circum@@ c@@ ision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sin@@ s of the f@@ les@@ h , in the circum@@ c@@ ision of Ch@@ r@@ ist ;
and that you make it your ambi@@ tion to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instruc@@ ted you ;
for this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left to the coming of the Lord , will in no way prece@@ de those who have fallen as@@ le@@ ep .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in la@@ bor and trav@@ ail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t obe@@ y our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be as@@ ha@@ med .
( but if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know how to rule his own house , how will he take care of the assembly of God ? )
if you instruc@@ t the brothers of these things , you will be a good ser@@ vant of Ch@@ r@@ ist J@@ es@@ us , no@@ ur@@ ished in the words of the faith , and of the good doc@@ tr@@ ine which you have followed .
let no man desp@@ ise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in p@@ urity .
but the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gen@@ ti@@ les might hear ; and I was delivered out of the m@@ outh of the lion .
for the land which has dr@@ un@@ k the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a cro@@ p su@@ itable for them for whose sake it is also til@@ led , receives b@@ les@@ sing from God ;
for God is not un@@ righ@@ te@@ ous , so as to forget your work and the la@@ bor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the sa@@ ints , and still do serve them .
they will not te@@ ach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' K@@ now the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
by faith , we understand that the uni@@ verse has been fra@@ med by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible .
without faith it is impossible to be well ple@@ asing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , Ab@@ ra@@ ham , when he was called , obe@@ yed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inher@@ it@@ ance . he went out , not kno@@ wing where he went .
by faith , he lived as an ali@@ en in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , d@@ wel@@ ling in ten@@ ts , with I@@ sa@@ ac and Jac@@ o@@ b , the he@@ ir@@ s with him of the same promise .
by faith , Mos@@ es , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king 's comman@@ d@@ ment .
looking to J@@ es@@ us , the author and perf@@ ec@@ ter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him en@@ du@@ red the cross , desp@@ ising its sh@@ ame , and has sat down at the right hand of the th@@ r@@ one of God .
therefore lift up the hands that han@@ g down and the fe@@ e@@ ble k@@ ne@@ es ,
and the ton@@ gue is a fire . the world of in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity among our members is the ton@@ gue , which def@@ il@@ es the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Ge@@ hen@@ na .
but you are a chosen race , a royal pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , a hol@@ y nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may procla@@ im the exc@@ el@@ len@@ ce of him who called you out of d@@ ark@@ ness into his mar@@ v@@ el@@ ous light :
but sanc@@ ti@@ fy the Lord God in your hear@@ ts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with hum@@ il@@ ity and fear :
for to this end the Go@@ od News was pre@@ ached even to the dead , that they might be jud@@ ged indeed as men in the f@@ les@@ h , but live as to God in the spirit .
for we did not follow c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly dev@@ ised f@@ ables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , but we were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ es@@ ty .
for if , after they have escaped the def@@ il@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Sav@@ ior J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , they are again ent@@ ang@@ led in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
but the heav@@ ens that now are , and the ear@@ th , by the same word have been stored up for fire , being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of un@@ go@@ dly men .
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Wor@@ d of life
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fel@@ low@@ ship with us . yes , and our fel@@ low@@ ship is with the F@@ ather , and with his Son , J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fel@@ low@@ ship with one another , and the blood of J@@ es@@ us Ch@@ r@@ ist , his Son , cleans@@ es us from all sin .
D@@ on '@@ t love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone lov@@ es the world , the F@@ ather 's love is@@ n '@@ t in him .
for all that is in the world , the l@@ ust of the f@@ les@@ h , the l@@ ust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is@@ n '@@ t the F@@ ather 's , but is the world 's .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the F@@ ather .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the dev@@ il . who@@ ever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do righ@@ te@@ ous@@ ness is not of God , neither is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother remains in death .
these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God , that you may know that you have eter@@ nal life , and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God .
he who has an e@@ ar , let him hear what the Spiri@@ t says to the assemb@@ lies . to him who over@@ comes I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the Par@@ ad@@ ise of my God .
" I know your works , op@@ pression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ y of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a syn@@ ago@@ gue of S@@ atan .
" to the an@@ gel of the assembly in Th@@ y@@ ati@@ ra write : " the Son of God , who has his eyes like a fla@@ me of fire , and his feet are like bur@@ n@@ ished br@@ ass , says these things :
he who over@@ comes will be ar@@ ray@@ ed in white gar@@ ments , and I will in no way blo@@ t his name out of the book of life , and I will conf@@ ess his name before my F@@ ather , and before his an@@ gel@@ s .
because you kept my command to en@@ dur@@ e , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who d@@ well on the ear@@ th .
I saw , and I heard something like a voice of many an@@ gel@@ s around the th@@ r@@ one , the living cre@@ atures , and the el@@ ders ; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands , and thousands of thousands ;
when he opened the fifth se@@ al , I saw under@@ ne@@ ath the alt@@ ar the so@@ ul@@ s of those who had been killed for the Wor@@ d of God , and for the testimony of the lam@@ b which they had .
after this , I saw four an@@ gel@@ s standing at the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , holding the four winds of the ear@@ th , so that no wind would blow on the ear@@ th , or on the sea , or on any tree .
for the power of the hor@@ ses is in their m@@ ou@@ ths , and in their ta@@ ils . for their ta@@ ils are like Ser@@ pen@@ ts , and have heads , and with them they harm .
the voice which I heard from heav@@ en , again speaking with me , said , " G@@ o , take the book which is open in the hand of the an@@ gel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I took the little book out of the an@@ gel 's hand , and ate it up . it was as swe@@ et as hon@@ ey in my m@@ outh . when I had e@@ aten it , my st@@ om@@ ach was made bitter .
from among the peoples , tri@@ bes , languages , and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days , and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb .
the great dra@@ g@@ on was thrown down , the old ser@@ p@@ ent , he who is called the dev@@ il and S@@ atan , the dec@@ e@@ i@@ ver of the whole world . he was thrown down to the ear@@ th , and his an@@ gel@@ s were thrown down with him .
then I stood on the s@@ and of the sea . I saw a be@@ ast coming up out of the sea , having ten hor@@ ns and seven heads . on his hor@@ ns were ten crow@@ ns , and on his heads , b@@ las@@ ph@@ em@@ ous names .
the be@@ ast which I saw was like a Le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his m@@ outh like the m@@ outh of a lion . the dra@@ g@@ on gave him his power , his th@@ r@@ one , and great authority .
all who d@@ well on the ear@@ th will worship him , everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lam@@ b who has been killed .
if anyone is to go into cap@@ tivity , he will go into cap@@ tivity . if anyone is to be killed with the s@@ word , he must be killed . here is the en@@ dur@@ ance and the faith of the sa@@ ints .
he causes all , the small and the great , the rich and the poor , and the free and the sla@@ ve , to be given marks on their right hands , or on their fore@@ heads ;
the smoke of their tor@@ ment goes up fore@@ ver and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the be@@ ast and his image , and who@@ ever receives the mark of his name .
the temp@@ le was filled with smoke from the gl@@ ory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temp@@ le , until the seven plagu@@ es of the seven an@@ gel@@ s would be finished .
the first went , and p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l into the ear@@ th , and it became a harmful and ev@@ il sor@@ e on the people who had the mark of the be@@ ast , and who wor@@ shi@@ ped his image .
the sixth p@@ oured out his bo@@ w@@ l on the great river , the E@@ up@@ h@@ rates . its water was dri@@ ed up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sun@@ rise .
I saw coming out of the m@@ outh of the dra@@ g@@ on , and out of the m@@ outh of the be@@ ast , and out of the m@@ outh of the false pro@@ phe@@ t , three un@@ clean spir@@ its , something like fro@@ gs ;
for they are spir@@ its of dem@@ ons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited ear@@ th , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty .
and on her fore@@ head a name was written , " my@@ ster@@ y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ L@@ O@@ N the great , the mother of the pro@@ stitu@@ tes and of the AB@@ O@@ MI@@ NAT@@ I@@ O@@ NS of the Earth . "
the ten hor@@ ns which you saw , and the be@@ ast , these will h@@ ate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her de@@ so@@ late , and will make her nak@@ ed , and will eat her f@@ les@@ h , and will bur@@ n her ut@@ ter@@ ly with fire .
for God has put in their hear@@ ts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their k@@ ing@@ dom to the be@@ ast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
for all the nations have dr@@ un@@ k of the wine of the wr@@ ath of her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , the kings of the ear@@ th committed sexual im@@ mor@@ ality with her , and the mer@@ chan@@ ts of the ear@@ th grew rich from the ab@@ und@@ ance of her luxury . "
for true and righ@@ te@@ ous are his judg@@ ments . for he has jud@@ ged the great pro@@ stitute , who cor@@ rupted the ear@@ th with her sexual im@@ mor@@ ality , and he has av@@ en@@ ged the blood of his servants at her hand . "
let us re@@ jo@@ ice and be exce@@ ed@@ ingly glad , and let us give the gl@@ ory to him . for the marriage of the lam@@ b has come , and his wife has made her@@ self ready . "
it was given to her that she would array her@@ self in bright , p@@ ure , fine lin@@ en : for the fine lin@@ en is the righ@@ te@@ ous acts of the sa@@ ints .
and he will come out to dec@@ e@@ ive the nations which are in the four cor@@ ners of the ear@@ th , Go@@ g and Mag@@ o@@ g , to gather them together to the war ; the number of whom is as the s@@ and of the sea .
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the an@@ gel who had shown me these things .
